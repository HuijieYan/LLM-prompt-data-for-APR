The potential error location in the code is the use of the `is_monotonic_increasing` attribute as if it were a method, rather than using it as a boolean value. This is likely causing an error when trying to call it as a method, leading to the warning message.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `is_monotonic_increasing` attribute is being used incorrectly. It is not being used as a boolean value, which it should be, instead it is being called as a method.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to remove the parentheses after `is_monotonic_increasing` and directly use its value. Additionally, the condition using `self.is_monotonic_increasing` should also be updated to use the value directly.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the fixed function
def _get_nearest_indexer(self, target: "Index", limit, tolerance) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Get the indexer for the nearest index labels; requires an index with
    values that can be subtracted from each other (e.g., not strings or
    tuples).
    """
    left_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "pad", limit=limit)
    right_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "backfill", limit=limit)

    target = np.asarray(target)
    left_distances = abs(self.values[left_indexer] - target)
    right_distances = abs(self.values[right_indexer] - target)

    op = operator.lt if self.is_monotonic_increasing else operator.le  # Directly using the boolean value
    indexer = np.where(
        op(left_distances, right_distances) | (right_indexer == -1),
        left_indexer,
        right_indexer,
    )
    if tolerance is not None:
        indexer = self._filter_indexer_tolerance(target, indexer, tolerance)
    return indexer
```
