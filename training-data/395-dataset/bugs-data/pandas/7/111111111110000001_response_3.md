The bug seems to be in the `_get_nearest_indexer` method of the `Index` class. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the subtraction operation, specifically with the `left_distances = abs(self.values[left_indexer] - target)` line. The error message suggests that the types datetime and object cannot be subtracted using the `abs` function.

The code attempts to find the nearest index labels by calculating the distances between the values and the target using the `values` attribute of the Index object. However, the `values` array might contain different types (datetime and object) due to which the subtraction operation fails.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the type of both 'values' and 'target' is consistent before performing the subtraction. We also need to handle cases where the types may not be subtractable.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_nearest_indexer` method:

```python
def _get_nearest_indexer(self, target: "Index", limit, tolerance) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Get the indexer for the nearest index labels; requires an index with
    values that can be subtracted from each other (e.g., not strings or tuples).
    """
    left_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "pad", limit=limit)
    right_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "backfill", limit=limit)

    target = np.asarray(target)
    
    # Convert all values to the same type before computation
    common_type = np.find_common_type([self.values.dtype, target.dtype], [])
    values = self.values.astype(common_type)
    target = target.astype(common_type)

    # Perform subtraction and find distances
    left_distances = abs(values[left_indexer] - target)
    right_distances = abs(values[right_indexer] - target)

    # Rest of the original code remains the same
    op = operator.lt if self.is_monotonic_increasing else operator.le
    indexer = np.where(
        op(left_distances, right_distances) | (right_indexer == -1),
        left_indexer,
        right_indexer,
    )
    if tolerance is not None:
        indexer = self._filter_indexer_tolerance(target, indexer, tolerance)
    return indexer
```

In the corrected code, we've explicitly converted both `values` and `target` to a common type using `np.find_common_type` so that the subtraction operation is consistent. This should fix the bug related to the subtraction operation.
