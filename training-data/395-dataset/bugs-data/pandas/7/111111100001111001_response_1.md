The buggy function `_get_nearest_indexer` is trying to find the nearest index labels, but there are multiple issues in the code that need to be addressed.

The first issue is that `self.is_monotonic_increasing` is being used as a boolean value within the function, but it is not being called as a function to retrieve the value. Instead, it needs to be called as `self.is_monotonic_increasing()` to get the actual boolean value.

The second issue is the comparison using the `op` variable. The `operator.lt` and `operator.le` need to be called as functions to perform the comparison correctly.

Additionally, it seems that the function `_filter_indexer_tolerance` is intended to be called as a method of the `Index` class, but it is not being called appropriately. This method should be called as `self._filter_indexer_tolerance` to operate on the current instance of the class.

Lastly, the array `indexer` is being returned directly without any data transformation, which suggests that it might not be producing the correct result.

Based on these issues, the following corrective actions should be taken:
1. Call `self.is_monotonic_increasing` as `self.is_monotonic_increasing()`.
2. Call `operator.lt` and `operator.le` as functions, passing the appropriate arguments to perform the comparison.
3. Call `self._filter_indexer_tolerance` to operate on the current instance of the class.
4. Ensure that the array `indexer` contains the correct values before being returned.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def _get_nearest_indexer(self, target: "Index", limit, tolerance) -> np.ndarray:
    left_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "pad", limit=limit)
    right_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "backfill", limit=limit)

    target = np.asarray(target)
    left_distances = abs(self.values[left_indexer] - target)
    right_distances = abs(self.values[right_indexer] - target)

    op = operator.lt if self.is_monotonic_increasing() else operator.le
    indexer = np.where(
        op(left_distances, right_distances) | (right_indexer == -1),
        left_indexer,
        right_indexer,
    )
    if tolerance is not None:
        indexer = self._filter_indexer_tolerance(target, indexer, tolerance)
    return indexer
```
