The buggy function `_get_nearest_indexer` is supposed to return the indexer for the nearest index labels. However, the function is not utilizing the `is_monotonic_increasing` attribute correctly in the `op` variable. This can lead to incorrect comparisons if the index is not monotonic.

The `op` variable is set as `operator.lt` without calling it properly as `operator.lt()`. This means it always takes the value of the `lt` function itself, which is always True, regardless of the comparison result between `left_distances` and `right_distances`. 

To fix this issue, we need to call the `lt` function to properly compare the distances and assign the result to the `op` variable.

Also, it's advised to handle the case where `left_indexer` or `right_indexer` is -1, as this implies that the `limit` parameter might not be allowing for a valid indexer to be generated.

Below is the corrected code for the `_get_nearest_indexer` function:

```python
def _get_nearest_indexer(self, target: "Index", limit, tolerance) -> np.ndarray:
    """
    Get the indexer for the nearest index labels; requires an index with
    values that can be subtracted from each other (e.g., not strings or
    tuples).
    """
    left_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "pad", limit=limit)
    right_indexer = self.get_indexer(target, "backfill", limit=limit)

    target = np.asarray(target)
    left_distances = abs(self.values[left_indexer] - target)
    right_distances = abs(self.values[right_indexer] - target)

    op = operator.lt() if self.is_monotonic_increasing else operator.le()
    indexer = np.where(
        (op(left_distances, right_distances)) | (right_indexer == -1),
        left_indexer,
        right_indexer,
    )
    if tolerance is not None:
        indexer = self._filter_indexer_tolerance(target, indexer, tolerance)
    return indexer
```
