The error message states that "Attributes of Series are different" and specifically highlights that the "dtype" attribute is different. The error occurs when the DataFrame is appended with itself, resulting in the removal of timezone awareness.

The issue is caused by the `append` function not preserving the timezone-awareness of the datetime values when appending rows. The original timezone information is lost after the append operation.

To fix the bug, the `append` function needs to be modified to preserve the timezone information of the datetime values when appending rows. This can be achieved by ensuring that the timezone information is retained during the append operation.

Here's the corrected code for the `append` function:

```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=False):
    """
    Append rows of `other` to the end of caller, returning a new object.

    Columns in `other` that are not in the caller are added as new columns.

    Parameters
    ----------
    other : DataFrame or Series/dict-like object, or list of these
        The data to append.
    ignore_index : bool, default False
        If True, do not use the index labels.
    verify_integrity : bool, default False
        If True, raise ValueError on creating index with duplicates.
    sort : bool, default False
        Sort columns if the columns of `self` and `other` are not aligned.

        .. versionadded:: 0.23.0
        .. versionchanged:: 1.0.0

            Changed to not sort by default.

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    concat : General function to concatenate DataFrame or Series objects.
    """
    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(other, (list, tuple)):
        to_concat = [self] + other
    else:
        to_concat = [self, other]

    result = concat(
        to_concat,
        ignore_index=ignore_index,
        verify_integrity=verify_integrity,
        sort=sort,
    )

    return result
```

By modifying the `append` function to use the `concat` function from pandas, the timezone-awareness of the datetime values will be preserved when rows are appended.
