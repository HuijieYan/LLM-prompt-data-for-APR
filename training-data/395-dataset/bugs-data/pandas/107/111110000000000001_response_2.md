There are multiple issues with the `append` function:
1. The function is overloading the existing `append` method without changing its behavior, which would lead to confusion.
2. There are issues with how the `other` DataFrame or Series is handled within the function. The logic for handling Series or dict-like objects is incorrect.
3. The logic for handling a list of DataFrames is not implemented properly.

To fix these issues, the `append` method should be rewritten to include proper handling of different input types, such as DataFrame, Series/dict-like objects, or a list of these. The logic for checking the type of input and handling it accordingly should be improved.

Here's the corrected `append` method:

```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=False):
    if isinstance(other, (Series, dict)):
        if isinstance(other, dict):
            other = Series(other)
        if other.name is None:
            raise TypeError("Can only append a Series if the Series has a name")
        other = DataFrame(other).T

    elif isinstance(other, list):
        if not other:
            pass
        elif not isinstance(other[0], DataFrame):
            other = DataFrame(other)
            if not self.columns.equals(other.columns):
                other = other.reindex(columns=self.columns, copy=False)

    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    to_concat = [self, other] if isinstance(other, DataFrame) else [self] + other
    return concat(to_concat, ignore_index=ignore_index, sort=sort)
```

In this corrected version, the function checks the type of the `other` input and handles it appropriately. For Series or dict-like objects, a new DataFrame is created, reshaped, and then concatenated. For a list of DataFrames, they are concatenated after checking and aligning the columns.
