The issue seems to be related to the handling of timezone information when appending a DataFrame to itself.

The bug is likely occurring because the append method does not preserve the timezone information when appending a DataFrame to itself. This results in the timezone information being lost in the appended result.

To fix the bug, the append method should be modified to preserve the timezone information of the original DataFrame when appending it to itself.

Here's the corrected code for the append method:

```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=False):
    if isinstance(other, (pd.DataFrame, pd.Series)):
        if isinstance(other, pd.Series):
            other = pd.DataFrame(other).T  # convert Series to DataFrame

        combined = pd.concat([self, other], ignore_index=ignore_index, sort=sort)
        return combined
    else:
        raise TypeError("Only DataFrame or Series objects can be appended.")
```

In this corrected code, we're using the concat method from pandas to combine the original DataFrame with the other DataFrame or Series. The use of concat will preserve the timezone information when appending the DataFrames.

By using this new implementation of the append method, the bug related to the loss of timezone information should be fixed. This will ensure that the timezone information is preserved when appending DataFrames.
