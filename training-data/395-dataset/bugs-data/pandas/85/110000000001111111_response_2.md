The issue seems to be related to the MultiIndex levels. The error message suggests that the name cannot be set on a level of a MultiIndex and recommends using `MultiIndex.set_names` instead. 

Looking at the function `_get_grouper_for_level`, it seems that the bug might be related to how the `level_index` and `grouper` variables are being created. This could potentially be causing issues with the MultiIndex levels.

The bug seems to occur because the function is trying to assign a name to a level of a MultiIndex directly, which is not allowed.

To fix this bug, the function `_get_grouper_for_level` needs to be modified to handle the creation of the `level_index` and `grouper` in a way that respects the constraints of MultiIndex levels. It's important to ensure that no direct modifications are made to the level names within the MultiIndex.

One possible approach to fix this bug is to use the `set_names` method of the MultiIndex to set the names of the levels, rather than directly assigning names. Additionally, the creation of the `level_index` and `grouper` variables should be reviewed to ensure that they comply with the constraints of MultiIndex levels.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_grouper_for_level` function:

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["_get_grouper_for_level"])
def _get_grouper_for_level(self, mapper, level):
    indexer = self.codes[level]
    level_index = self.levels[level]

    if mapper is not None:
        # Handle group mapping function and return
        level_values = self.levels[level].take(indexer)
        grouper = level_values.map(mapper)
        return grouper, None, None

    codes, uniques = algos.factorize(indexer, sort=True)

    if len(uniques) > 0 and uniques[0] == -1:
        # Handle NAs
        mask = indexer != -1
        ok_codes, uniques = algos.factorize(indexer[mask], sort=True)

        codes = np.empty(len(indexer), dtype=indexer.dtype)
        codes[mask] = ok_codes
        codes[~mask] = -1

    if len(uniques) < len(level_index):
        # Remove unobserved levels from level_index
        level_index = level_index.take(uniques)

    if len(level_index):
        grouper = level_index.take(codes)
    else:
        grouper = level_index.copy()  # using copy method to create a new Index

    return grouper, codes, level_index
```

In this corrected code, the creation of the `grouper` now uses the `copy` method to ensure that a new Index is created without directly manipulating existing MultiIndex levels. Additionally, the method for setting names on a level of MultiIndex should be used if there's a need to set names.
