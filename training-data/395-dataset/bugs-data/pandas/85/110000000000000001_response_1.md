The potential error in the given function is the use of the '@Appender' decorator, which is not a standard Python decorator. It seems that the intention was to use a decorator to modify the behavior of the function, but without knowing the specific implementation of this decorator, it is difficult to provide a fix.

One possible approach for fixing the bug would be to remove the decorator and directly modify the behavior of the function by changing its implementation. Another approach could be to find the correct implementation of the '@Appender' decorator and use it as intended.

As the specific implementation of the '@Appender' decorator is unknown, the corrected code cannot be directly provided. However, the function could be revised as follows:

```python
def _get_grouper_for_level(self, mapper, level):
    indexer = self.codes[level]
    level_index = self.levels[level]

    if mapper is not None:
        # Handle group mapping function and return
        level_values = self.levels[level].take(indexer)
        grouper = level_values.map(mapper)
        return grouper, None, None

    codes, uniques = algos.factorize(indexer, sort=True)

    if len(uniques) > 0 and uniques[0] == -1:
        # Handle NAs
        mask = indexer != -1
        ok_codes, uniques = algos.factorize(indexer[mask], sort=True)

        codes = np.empty(len(indexer), dtype=indexer.dtype)
        codes[mask] = ok_codes
        codes[~mask] = -1

    if len(uniques) < len(level_index):
        # Remove unobserved levels from level_index
        level_index = level_index.take(uniques)

    if len(level_index):
        grouper = level_index.take(codes)
    else:
        grouper = level_index.take(codes, fill_value=True)

    return grouper, codes, level_index
``` 

This removes the unknown decorator and provides a cleaner version of the function.
