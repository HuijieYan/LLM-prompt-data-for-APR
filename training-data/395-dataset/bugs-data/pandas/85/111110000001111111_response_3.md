The bug appears to be in the `_get_grouper_for_level` function, specifically in the line `level_index.take(codes)`. The issue seems to be related to the use of the `take` method with the `level_index` variable which is causing a runtime error.

The error message "Cannot set name on a level of a MultiIndex. Use 'MultiIndex.set_names' instead" is likely related to the incorrect usage of a method for setting the name on a level of a MultiIndex. This error message is likely not directly related to the `_get_grouper_for_level` function, but it could be indicative of a larger issue within the MultiIndex implementation.

The bug occurs because the `take` method is being used incorrectly with the `level_index` variable. The `take` method should be used with an array of indices and is being misused with a pandas Index type.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `take` method is being used correctly and that the variables `grouper` and `level_index` are of the correct type.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_grouper_for_level` function:

```python
def _get_grouper_for_level(self, mapper, level):
    indexer = self.codes[level]
    level_index = self.levels[level]

    if mapper is not None:
        # Handle group mapping function and return
        level_values = level_index.take(indexer)
        grouper = level_values.map(mapper)
        return grouper, None, None

    codes, uniques = algos.factorize(indexer, sort=True)

    if len(uniques) > 0 and uniques[0] == -1:
        # Handle NAs
        mask = indexer != -1
        ok_codes, uniques = algos.factorize(indexer[mask], sort=True)

        codes = np.empty(len(indexer), dtype=indexer.dtype)
        codes[mask] = ok_codes
        codes[~mask] = -1

    if len(uniques) < len(level_index):
        # Remove unobserved levels from level_index
        level_index = level_index.take(uniques)

    if len(level_index):
        grouper = level_index.take(codes)
    else:
        grouper = level_index.take(codes, fill_value=True)

    return grouper, codes, level_index
```

With this correction, the `take` method is now being used on the `level_values` array, which ensures that it's being used correctly. The corrected function should now handle the group mapping and NAs properly without causing a runtime error.
