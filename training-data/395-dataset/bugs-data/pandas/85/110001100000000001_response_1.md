Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the lines where `self.codes[level]` and `self.levels[level]` are used. These lines are attempting to access the `codes` and `levels` attributes as if they were lists, but based on their names and usage, they are probably meant to be methods.

Reason for the bug: The `codes` and `levels` attributes are being accessed as if they are lists, but they are likely methods or properties. This is causing a TypeError when attempting to use them as lists.

Approaches for fixing the bug: Check the definition of the `codes` and `levels` methods/properties to ensure they are returning lists or arrays, and then use their return values directly in the `_get_grouper_for_level` function.

Corrected code:

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["_get_grouper_for_level"])
def _get_grouper_for_level(self, mapper, level):
    indexer = self.codes()[level]  # Corrected - accessing the return value of codes method
    level_index = self.levels()[level]  # Corrected - accessing the return value of levels method

    if mapper is not None:
        # Handle group mapping function and return
        level_values = self.levels()[level].take(indexer)
        grouper = level_values.map(mapper)
        return grouper, None, None

    codes, uniques = algos.factorize(indexer, sort=True)

    if len(uniques) > 0 and uniques[0] == -1:
        # Handle NAs
        mask = indexer != -1
        ok_codes, uniques = algos.factorize(indexer[mask], sort=True)

        codes = np.empty(len(indexer), dtype=indexer.dtype)
        codes[mask] = ok_codes
        codes[~mask] = -1

    if len(uniques) < len(level_index):
        # Remove unobserved levels from level_index
        level_index = level_index.take(uniques)

    if len(level_index):
        grouper = level_index.take(codes)
    else:
        grouper = level_index.take(codes, fill_value=True)

    return grouper, codes, level_index
