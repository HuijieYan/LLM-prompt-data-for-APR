The error message indicates that the bug is related to setting the name on a level of a MultiIndex. 

Upon analyzing the test code, we can see that the bug occurs in the line `result = df.groupby("B").apply(lambda x: x.sum())` where the DataFrame is grouped by the "B" column and the apply method is used to apply the sum function to each group.

The bug seems to be related to the handling of MultiIndex level names within the apply method, which is consistent with the error message indicating that the name cannot be set on a level of a MultiIndex.

The reason for the bug is likely due to incorrect handling of MultiIndex level names within the _get_grouper_for_level method.

To fix this bug, we need to review the logic within the _get_grouper_for_level method and ensure that the names of the MultiIndex level are being handled correctly.

Here's the corrected _get_grouper_for_level method:

```python
def _get_grouper_for_level(self, mapper, level):
    indexer = self.codes[level]
    level_index = self.levels[level]

    if mapper is not None:
        level_values = self.levels[level].take(indexer)
        grouper = level_values.map(mapper)
        return grouper, None, None

    codes, _ = algos.factorize(indexer, sort=True)

    if len(level_index):
        grouper = level_index.take(codes)
    else:
        grouper = level_index.take(codes, fill_value=True)

    return grouper, codes, level_index
```

In the corrected code, we have removed the handling of uniques and the mask to simplify the logic and ensure that the level names of the MultiIndex are handled correctly.

By implementing these changes, we aim to resolve the RuntimeError related to MultiIndex level names that occurred during the application of the sum function using the groupby apply method.
