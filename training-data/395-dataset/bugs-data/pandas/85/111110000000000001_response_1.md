The potential error within the `_get_grouper_for_level` function is that it is accessing the `codes` and `levels` attributes as if they were methods instead of arrays. This is likely causing an AttributeError when this function is called because it is trying to call these attributes as if they were methods, which they are not.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the parentheses from the calls to `self.codes` and `self.levels` so that they are treated as arrays being accessed rather than methods being called.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
    @Appender(_index_shared_docs["_get_grouper_for_level"])
    def _get_grouper_for_level(self, mapper, level):
        indexer = self.codes[level]
        level_index = self.levels[level]
    
        if mapper is not None:
            # Handle group mapping function and return
            level_values = self.levels[level].take(indexer)
            grouper = level_values.map(mapper)
            return grouper, None, None
    
        codes, uniques = algos.factorize(indexer, sort=True)
    
        if len(uniques) > 0 and uniques[0] == -1:
            # Handle NAs
            mask = indexer != -1
            ok_codes, uniques = algos.factorize(indexer[mask], sort=True)
    
            codes = np.empty(len(indexer), dtype=indexer.dtype)
            codes[mask] = ok_codes
            codes[~mask] = -1
    
        if len(uniques) < len(level_index):
            # Remove unobserved levels from level_index
            level_index = level_index.take(uniques)
    
        if len(level_index):
            grouper = level_index.take(codes)
        else:
            grouper = level_index.take(codes, fill_value=True)
    
        return grouper, codes, level_index
```
