The error message indicates that the name of the index is being set, but the appropriate method is not being used, resulting in a RuntimeError. 

The issue is likely related to the function `_get_grouper_for_level` and its handling of index names and MultiIndex objects, which is leading to the error in the test case.

Upon analyzing the function, it appears that the level_index's name is being set directly, leading to the RuntimeError. Additionally, the resulting grouper is not created properly, which may be related to the way level_index is handled.

To address the issue, it's advisable to use the `set_names` method to set the name of the MultiIndex to avoid the RuntimeError. Additionally, the creation of the grouper should be carefully reviewed to ensure it's correctly generated based on the provided inputs. 

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_grouper_for_level` function:

```python
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["_get_grouper_for_level"])
def _get_grouper_for_level(self, mapper, level):
    indexer = self.codes[level]
    level_index = self.levels[level]

    if mapper is not None:
        # Handle group mapping function and return
        level_values = self.levels[level].take(indexer)
        grouper = level_values.map(mapper)
        return grouper, None, None

    codes, uniques = algos.factorize(indexer, sort=True)

    if len(uniques) > 0 and uniques[0] == -1:
        # Handle NAs
        mask = indexer != -1
        ok_codes, uniques = algos.factorize(indexer[mask], sort=True)

        codes = np.empty(len(indexer), dtype=indexer.dtype)
        codes[mask] = ok_codes
        codes[~mask] = -1

    if len(uniques) < len(level_index):
        # Remove unobserved levels from level_index
        level_index = level_index.take(uniques)

    if len(level_index):
        # Use set_names method to set the name
        level_index = level_index.set_names(self.levels.names[level])
        grouper = level_index.take(codes)
    else:
        # Use set_names method to set the name
        level_index = level_index.set_names(self.levels.names[level])
        grouper = level_index.take(codes, fill_value=True)

    return grouper, codes, level_index
```

In the corrected code, the `set_names` method is used to set the name of the MultiIndex, and the creation of the grouper is reviewed to ensure it's correctly generated based on the inputs.
