The test cases provided attempt to assert the equality of pandas data structures (DataFrames and Series) with different dtypes (data types), causing the assertion errors in the test functions.

The potential error location is within the `assert_series_equal` function. The function performs checks for different properties of Series objects such as dtype, index, class, etc. It also tries to handle different dtypes like categorical, interval, or extension dtypes, which might lead to errors due to incorrect handling of the dtype comparisons.

The bug is occurring because the function is not properly handling the comparison of extension dtypes. The function incorrectly asserts that both left and right ExtensionArrays are of type `ExtensionArray`, leading to the AssertionErrors in the tests.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to handle dtype comparisons for extension dtypes correctly. This can be achieved by updating the validation and comparison logic to compare extension dtypes appropriately.

The corrected `assert_series_equal` function:

```python
def assert_series_equal(
    left,
    right,
    check_dtype=True,
    check_index_type="equiv",
    check_series_type=True,
    check_less_precise=False,
    check_names=True,
    check_exact=False,
    check_datetimelike_compat=False,
    check_categorical=True,
    check_category_order=True,
    obj="Series",
):
    # ... previous code ...

    if check_dtype:
        if isinstance(left.dtype, ExtensionDtype) and isinstance(right.dtype, ExtensionDtype):
            assert_extension_array_equal(left, right)
        # ... other dtype comparisons for non-extension dtypes ...

    # ... rest of the function remains unchanged ...

```

With this corrected logic, the `assert_series_equal` function now properly handles the comparison of extension dtypes. This should resolve the assertion errors encountered in the test functions.
