The error occurs when testing the equality between two DataFrames or Series with different dtypes and setting `check_dtype` to True. This bug seems to be related to the check_dtype argument not properly handling extension dtypes such as Int64 and interval.

The potential error location within the function is identified to be the section where the function checks for extension array dtype equality.

The bug occurs because the function is not handling extension dtypes properly when comparing the dtypes of the two objects.

To fix the bug, the function could be updated to handle extension dtypes properly during dtype comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the assert_series_equal function:

```python
import pandas.api.types as pdtypes
import pandas.testing as tm
from pandas import Series

def assert_series_equal(
    left,
    right,
    check_dtype=True,
    check_index_type="equiv",
    check_series_type=True,
    check_less_precise=False,
    check_names=True,
    check_exact=False,
    check_datetimelike_compat=False,
    check_categorical=True,
    check_category_order=True,
    obj="Series",
):
    # ... (other code remains the same)

    if check_dtype:
        if pdtypes.is_extension_array_dtype(left.dtype) or pdtypes.is_extension_array_dtype(right.dtype):
            assert_extension_array_equal(left, right, check_dtype=check_dtype, obj=obj)
        else:
            assert_attr_equal("dtype", left, right, obj=f"Attributes of {obj}")

    # ... (rest of the code remains the same)
```

The changes include using `pandas.api.types.is_extension_array_dtype` to properly handle extension dtypes during dtype comparison.

By making these changes, the function should handle extension dtypes properly when comparing series objects, resolving the bug.
