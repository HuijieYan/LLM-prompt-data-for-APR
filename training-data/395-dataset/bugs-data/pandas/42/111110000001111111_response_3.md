The error seems to be occurring in the `assert_series_equal` function, specifically in the `assert_extension_array_equal` method. The `assert_extension_array_equal` method is expecting both `left` and `right` arguments to be of type `ExtensionArray`, but it seems that the `right` argument is not an `ExtensionArray`. This is likely due to a regression related to the changes made in #32570.

The bug occurs because the `assert_series_equal` method does not handle the case where one of the series has an extension dtype and the other doesn't. This results in an assertion error when comparing the two series.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `assert_extension_array_equal` method to handle the case where one of the inputs is not an ExtensionArray. We can modify the method to first check if both inputs are ExtensionArray, and if not, handle this case differently to avoid the assertion error.

Here's the corrected code for the `assert_series_equal` function:

```python
def assert_series_equal(
    left,
    right,
    check_dtype=True,
    check_index_type="equiv",
    check_series_type=True,
    check_less_precise=False,
    check_names=True,
    check_exact=False,
    check_datetimelike_compat=False,
    check_categorical=True,
    check_category_order=True,
    obj="Series",
):
    # ... (existing code)

    if is_extension_array_dtype(left.dtype) and is_extension_array_dtype(right.dtype):
        # Both inputs are ExtensionArray
        assert_extension_array_equal(left._values, right._values)
    else:
        # Handle the case where one or both inputs are not ExtensionArray
        condition = (
            (is_extension_array_dtype(left.dtype) or is_extension_array_dtype(right.dtype))
            and check_dtype
        )
        if condition:
            raise AssertionError("right is not an ExtensionArray")

    # ... (existing code)
```

This change checks whether both inputs are ExtensionArray, and if they are, it calls `assert_extension_array_equal`. Otherwise, it handles the case where one or both inputs are not ExtensionArray, preventing the assertion error.
