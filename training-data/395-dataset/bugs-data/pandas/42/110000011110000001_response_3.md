Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to be with the `_check_isinstance` function inside the `assert_series_equal` function, as it is raising an `AssertionError` when it checks the type of the right object.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `_check_isinstance` function is expecting the `right` object to be of type `IntervalArray`, but it is finding a different type (`PandasArray`) instead.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the `_check_isinstance` function to handle the `PandasArray` type as well, or
2. Revise the type checking and conversion between different types within the `assert_series_equal` function.

Corrected Code:
```python
def assert_series_equal(
    left,
    right,
    check_dtype=True,
    # ... other parameters
):
    # ... function implementation

    # instance validation
    _check_isinstance(left, right, Series)

    if check_series_type:
        assert_class_equal(left, right, obj=obj)

    # ... other comparisons and checks

    if is_extension_array_dtype(left.dtype):
        # Update the type check to handle PandasArray
        if (is_extension_array_dtype(left.dtype) and
                isinstance(right, pd.arrays.ExtendedArray)):
            assert_extension_array_equal(
                left._values, right._values, check_dtype=check_dtype, obj=str(obj)
            )
        else:
            raise AssertionError(f"Right object type {type(right)} is not supported")

    # ... other checks and assertions

def _check_isinstance(left, right, cls):
    cls_name = cls.__name__

    if not isinstance(left, cls):
        raise AssertionError(f"{cls_name} Expected type {cls}, found {type(left)} instead")
    # Update the type check to handle PandasArray
    if not isinstance(right, cls) and not isinstance(right, pd.arrays.ExtendedArray):
        raise AssertionError(f"{cls_name} Expected type {cls}, found {type(right)} instead")
```
In the corrected code:
1. The `assert_series_equal` function now includes conditional checks to handle `PandasArray` within the `is_extension_array_dtype` block.
2. The `_check_isinstance` function has been updated to check for `PandasArray` as well, along with the original type check. If the type is not as expected, it raises an `AssertionError` indicating that the type is not supported.
