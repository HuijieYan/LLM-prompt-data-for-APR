The issue seems to be related to the comparison of two Series objects with different dtypes in the `assert_series_equal` function. This comparison triggers an `AssertionError` when the dtypes are different, and it seems that the code is not handling extension dtypes appropriately.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the `assert_extension_array_equal` function call. This function is used to compare two ExtensionArray objects, and it seems that it is not handling the scenario where one of the arrays is not an ExtensionArray, leading to the `AssertionError`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code is not handling extension dtypes properly when comparing two Series objects. ExtensionArray should be checked before being compared, and the comparison logic seems to be flawed.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to update the logic in the `assert_series_equal` function to correctly handle extension dtypes. Specifically, the `assert_extension_array_equal` function needs to be updated to handle cases where one of the arrays is not an ExtensionArray.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected function for assert_series_equal
def assert_series_equal(
    left,
    right,
    check_dtype=True,
    check_index_type="equiv",
    check_series_type=True,
    check_less_precise=False,
    check_names=True,
    check_exact=False,
    check_datetimelike_compat=False,
    check_categorical=True,
    check_category_order=True,
    obj="Series",
):
    # ... existing function code ...

    # extension array comparison
    if is_extension_array_dtype(left[0]) or is_extension_array_dtype(right[0]):  # Assuming left[0] and right[0] represent the values
        assert_extension_array_equal(left, right, check_dtype=check_dtype, obj=obj)
    else:
        _testing.assert_almost_equal(
            left,
            right,
            check_less_precise=check_less_precise,
            check_dtype=check_dtype,
            obj=str(obj),
        )

    # metadata comparison
    if check_names:
        assert_attr_equal("name", left, right, obj=obj)

    if check_categorical:
        if is_categorical_dtype(left) or is_categorical_dtype(right):
            assert_categorical_equal(
                left._values,
                right._values,
                obj=f"{obj} category",
                check_category_order=check_category_order,
            )
```

In this corrected function, an additional check is added before calling `assert_extension_array_equal` to ensure that the comparison is only made when it is appropriate. If the values are not ExtensionArrays, the comparison is handled using the `_testing.assert_almost_equal` function.

This adjustment should address the issue with the comparison of extension dtypes and prevent the `AssertionError` when one of the arrays is not an ExtensionArray.
