The buggy function `assert_series_equal` is throwing an AssertionError due to a comparison error between two Series objects.

The error occurs when comparing the dtypes of the left and right Series objects. When the dtypes are different, it should raise an AssertionError, but the function is not handling this case properly.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the part of the function that handles the dtype comparison. We should check if the dtypes are different and raise an AssertionError in this case.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def assert_series_equal(
    left,
    right,
    check_dtype=True,
    check_index_type="equiv",
    check_series_type=True,
    check_less_precise=False,
    check_names=True,
    check_exact=False,
    check_datetimelike_compat=False,
    check_categorical=True,
    check_category_order=True,
    obj="Series",
):
    """
    Check that left and right Series are equal.

    ... # rest of the docstring

    """
    __tracebackhide__ = True

    # instance validation
    _check_isinstance(left, right, Series)

    if check_series_type:
        assert_class_equal(left, right, obj=obj)

    # length comparison (unchanged)

    # index comparison (unchanged)

    if check_dtype:
        # We want to skip exact dtype checking when `check_categorical`
        # is False. We'll still raise if only one is a `Categorical`,
        # regardless of `check_categorical`
        if (
            is_categorical_dtype(left.dtype)
            and is_categorical_dtype(right.dtype)
            and not check_categorical
        ):
            pass
        else:
            if left.dtype != right.dtype:
                raise AssertionError(f"Dtype of {obj} is different")

    # The rest of the function remains unchanged
    ...
```
In the corrected code, if the dtypes of the left and right Series objects are different, an AssertionError will be raised.
