The bug occurs in the `assert_series_equal` function of the `_testing.py` file. This function is used to check the equality of two Pandas Series objects with various options to customize the comparison.

The error message indicates that the `right` parameter is not being recognized as an ExtensionArray, which is asserted to be the case in the `assert_extension_array_equal` function. This suggests that the bug is related to the identification of the data type of the `right` parameter.

In the provided test cases, the error occurs when comparing Series with different dtypes (e.g., Int64 and int64). This might be causing the bug because the current implementation is not handling this case properly.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to enhance the logic for comparing different data types in the `assert_series_equal` function. Specifically, we need to address the handling of different dtypes and extension arrays to ensure that they are correctly recognized and compared.

Below is the corrected code for the `assert_series_equal` function:

```python
def assert_series_equal(
    left,
    right,
    check_dtype=True,
    check_index_type="equiv",
    check_series_type=True,
    check_less_precise=False,
    check_names=True,
    check_exact=False,
    check_datetimelike_compat=False,
    check_categorical=True,
    check_category_order=True,
    obj="Series",
):
    # ... (omitted code) ...

    # Enhance the logic for comparing different data types
    if is_extension_array_dtype(left.dtype) or is_extension_array_dtype(right.dtype):
        assert_extension_array_equal(left, right, check_dtype=check_dtype, check_less_precise=check_less_precise, check_exact=check_exact)
    elif check_dtype:
        assert_attr_equal("dtype", left, right, obj="Attributes of Series")

    # ... (omitted code) ...
```

In this corrected code, we have added a conditional block to handle the comparison of extension array data types. This block ensures that the `assert_extension_array_equal` function is correctly called when dealing with extension arrays. Additionally, we still perform dtype comparison for non-extension array dtypes if `check_dtype` is True. This change should address the bug and provide a more robust handling of different data types in the comparison of Pandas Series.
