The bug occurs in the `assert_series_equal` function, specifically in the conditional block when checking for extension array dtypes. The error message "right is not an ExtensionArray" is thrown at this point, indicating that the right side is not recognized as an ExtensionArray.

Upon examining the input parameters for the test cases, it is apparent that the bug occurs due to the improper handling of extension array dtypes. When comparing two Series objects, the extension array dtypes are not handled correctly, leading to the AssertionError.

To fix this bug, the conditional block responsible for handling extension array dtypes needs to be revised to ensure that both left and right sides are properly recognized as ExtensionArray objects. Additionally, the comparison logic for extension array dtypes needs to be updated to handle the comparison correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `assert_series_equal` function:

```python
def assert_series_equal(
    left,
    right,
    check_dtype=True,
    check_index_type="equiv",
    check_series_type=True,
    check_less_precise=False,
    check_names=True,
    check_exact=False,
    check_datetimelike_compat=False,
    check_categorical=True,
    check_category_order=True,
    obj="Series",
):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    if is_extension_array_dtype(left.array) or is_extension_array_dtype(right.array):
        assert_extension_array_equal(left, right, check_dtype, check_less_precise, check_exact)
    elif needs_i8_conversion(left.dtype) or needs_i8_conversion(right.dtype):
        assert_extension_array_equal(left, right, check_dtype, check_less_precise, check_exact)
    else:
        _testing.assert_almost_equal(
            left._values,
            right._values,
            check_less_precise=check_less_precise,
            check_dtype=check_dtype,
            obj=str(obj),
        )

    # ... (remaining code remains unchanged)
```

In the corrected code, the handling of extension array dtypes has been updated to correctly identify and compare the extension arrays on both the left and right sides. This should resolve the bug and ensure proper comparison of Series objects with extension array dtypes.
