Potential Error Location:
The error is likely occurring in the comparison and assertion statements within the function `assert_series_equal`.

Reasons for the Bug:
1. The function is attempting to compare and assert equality between two Series, including their values, dtypes, and metadata. 
2. In some cases, the dtypes of the left and right Series are different (e.g., Int64 vs. int64 or interval vs. object), leading to dtype comparison failures.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the dtype comparison logic to handle different dtype instances appropriately based on their compatibility.
2. Check for specific dtype instances (e.g., `Int64Dtype` and `dtype('int64')`, `interval` and `object`) and implement custom comparison logic for these cases.
3. Consider using specific dtype comparison functions or methods provided by the pandas library.
4. Ensure that the comparison and assertion logic accounts for various dtype combinations and their compatibility.

Corrected Code:
```python
def assert_series_equal(
    left,
    right,
    check_dtype=True,
    check_index_type="equiv",
    check_series_type=True,
    check_less_precise=False,
    check_names=True,
    check_exact=False,
    check_datetimelike_compat=False,
    check_categorical=True,
    check_category_order=True,
    obj="Series",
):
    __tracebackhide__ = True

    _check_isinstance(left, right, Series)

    if check_series_type:
        assert_class_equal(left, right, obj=obj)

    if len(left) != len(right):
        msg1 = f"{len(left)}, {left.index}"
        msg2 = f"{len(right)}, {right.index}"
        raise_assert_detail(obj, "Series length are different", msg1, msg2)

    assert_index_equal(
        left.index,
        right.index,
        exact=check_index_type,
        check_names=check_names,
        check_less_precise=check_less_precise,
        check_exact=check_exact,
        check_categorical=check_categorical,
        obj=f"{obj}.index",
    )

    if check_dtype:
        # Custom dtype comparison logic based on specific dtype instances
        if isinstance(left.dtype, Int64Dtype) and isinstance(right.dtype, pd.Int64Dtype):
            assert_attr_equal("dtype", left, right, obj=f"Attributes of {obj}")
        elif isinstance(left.dtype, pd.IntervalDtype) and right.dtype == np.object:
            assert_extension_array_equal(left.array, right.array)
        else:
            assert_attr_equal("dtype", left, right, obj=f"Attributes of {obj}")

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```
In the corrected code, the dtype comparison logic has been adapted to handle different dtype instances appropriately, based on their compatibility. This should prevent the comparison failures observed in the buggy code.
