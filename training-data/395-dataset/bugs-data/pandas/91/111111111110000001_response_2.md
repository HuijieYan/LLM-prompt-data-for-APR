The provided code contains a method called `searchsorted` in the class `TimedeltaIndex` which seems to have some issues according to the error messages provided from the test cases.

The error message from the test function indicates that the `searchsorted` method in the `TimedeltaIndex` class is not raising the expected `TypeError` when invoked with certain input types.

Upon analyzing the code and the error message, it seems that the method `searchsorted` is not handling the input types properly. It is not raising the expected `TypeError` when called with certain input types such as integer, float, datetime, and Period.

To fix the issue, the method `searchsorted` needs to properly handle different input types and raise a `TypeError` when called with incompatible types.

Below is the corrected code for the `searchsorted` method in the `TimedeltaIndex` class:

```python
# corrected `searchsorted` method
def searchsorted(self, value, side='left', sorter=None):
    if not isinstance(value, (np.timedelta64, str, int, float, pd.Timedelta)):
        raise TypeError("searchsorted requires compatible dtype or scalar")

    if isinstance(value, (np.ndarray, pd.Index)):
        value = np.array(value, dtype=_TD_DTYPE, copy=False)
    elif isinstance(value, str):
        value = Timedelta(value).asm8.view(_TD_DTYPE)
    else:
        value = np.array(value, dtype='timedelta64[ns]', copy=False)

    return self.values.searchsorted(value, side=side, sorter=sorter)
```

In the corrected code:
- We first check if the input `value` is an instance of the compatible data types (np.timedelta64, str, int, float, pd.Timedelta). If not, we raise a `TypeError`.
- For different types of input, we handle the conversion appropriately as per the requirements of the `searchsorted` function.
- After handling the input types, we call `self.values.searchsorted` with the modified `value`.

With these changes, the `searchsorted` method should now properly handle different input types and raise a `TypeError` when called with incompatible types, as expected by the test cases.
