The bug seems to be in the `searchsorted` method of the `TimedeltaIndex` class. This method takes a `value` parameter, checks its type, and then performs an operation based on the type of the `value` parameter. However, the bug might be due to incorrect type handling or incorrect processing of the `value` parameter.

The error in the buggy function is caused by incorrectly converting the `value` parameter to `numpy.timedelta64` type. Since the `value` parameter can be an integer, float, or ndarray, the type conversion should be handled based on the input type. Additionally, the function should handle the case when `value` is already in the correct format, without unnecessary conversion.

To fix the bug, the type of the `value` parameter should be checked and handled accordingly. It is also important to remove unnecessary conversion and ensure that the correct type is returned from the function.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def searchsorted(self, value, side='left', sorter=None):
    value_to_search = None
    if isinstance(value, (np.ndarray, Index)):
        value_to_search = np.array(value, dtype='timedelta64[ns]', copy=False)
    elif isinstance(value, (int, np.int64, float)):
        if isinstance(value, float):
            value = int(value)
        value_to_search = np.array(np.timedelta64(value, 'ns'))
    else:
        value_to_search = value
    
    return self.values.searchsorted(value_to_search, side=side, sorter=sorter)
```
