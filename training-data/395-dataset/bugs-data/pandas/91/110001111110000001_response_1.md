The error message shows that the `searchsorted` function is not behaving as expected. The function accepts a variety of input types, including integers, floats, datetimes, and other types, but it's failing to handle them appropriately.

Looking at the code of the `searchsorted` function, there are two possible reasons for this issue:

1. The function is unable to handle the input types correctly, which results in a ValueError.
2. The function is not converting the input to the correct type (Timedelta) before performing the search.

To fix the bug, the `searchsorted` function needs to be updated to correctly handle the various input types. Additionally, the input should be converted to the appropriate type (Timedelta) before performing the search.

Here's the corrected code for the `searchsorted` function:

```python
def searchsorted(self, value, side='left', sorter=None):
    if not isinstance(self, TimedeltaIndex):
        raise ValueError("searchsorted is only supported for TimedeltaIndex")
    
    if isinstance(value, (np.ndarray, Index)):
        value = np.array(value, dtype=_TD_DTYPE, copy=False)
    elif isinstance(value, (int, float)):
        value = pd.Timedelta(value).to_timedelta64()
    elif isinstance(value, str):
        value = pd.Timedelta(value).to_timedelta64()
    elif isinstance(value, datetime):
        value = pd.Timedelta(value).to_timedelta64()

    return self.values.searchsorted(value, side=side, sorter=sorter)
```

In the corrected code:
- We added a check to ensure that the function is only called for a TimedeltaIndex. If it's not a TimedeltaIndex, a ValueError is raised.
- For various input types, we convert the input `value` to Timedelta before performing the search.

This corrected code should handle the different input types correctly and perform the search as expected.
