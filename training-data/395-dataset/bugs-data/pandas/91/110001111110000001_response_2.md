The error occurs in the `searchsorted` method of the `TimedeltaIndex` class. This method is supposed to perform a search for the position of the specified value within the index. However, there are several issues in the method, leading to various error types such as TypeError and ValueError when the method is tested.

The first issue is in the `TimedeltaIndex` class in the method `searchsorted`. The `value` passed to the method is checked to see if it is an instance of `np.ndarray` or `Index`. If it is, the method converts the `value` to a `Timedelta`. However, if the `value` is not an instance of `np.ndarray` or `Index`, it is assumed to be a scalar and is directly converted to `Timedelta`. This is incorrect because the `value` could be of any type and should be handled accordingly.

The second issue arises from the conversion of `value` to `Timedelta`. If the `value` is not an instance of `np.ndarray` or `Index`, it is directly converted to `Timedelta` with the assumption that it can be directly converted. This assumption is incorrect and leads to ValueError when the method is tested with invalid types of `value`.

To fix the issues, the method should be modified to handle different types of `value` appropriately. It should also perform checks to ensure that the conversion to `Timedelta` is valid before proceeding.

The corrected implementation of the `searchsorted` method is as follows:

```python
def searchsorted(self, value, side='left', sorter=None):
    if not isinstance(value, (np.ndarray, Index)):
        try:
            value = pd.to_timedelta(value)
        except (ValueError, TypeError):
            raise TypeError("searchsorted requires compatible dtype or scalar")
    else:
        value = np.array(value, dtype=_TD_DTYPE, copy=False)
    
    return self.values.searchsorted(value, side=side, sorter=sorter)
```

In this corrected implementation, the method first checks if the `value` is not an instance of `np.ndarray` or `Index`. If it's not, it attempts to convert `value` to `Timedelta` using `pd.to_timedelta`. If the conversion fails, it raises a TypeError with the appropriate message. This approach ensures that the method handles different types of `value` appropriately and avoids the ValueError that occurred previously.
