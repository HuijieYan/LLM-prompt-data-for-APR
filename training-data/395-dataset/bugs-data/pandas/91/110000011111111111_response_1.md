The buggy function `searchsorted` is part of the TimedeltaIndex class in the pandas library. The function is meant to return the indices where the input values would be inserted in sorted order.

Looking at the error messages from the test functions, it seems that the `searchsorted` function is raising a `ValueError` instead of the expected/reasonable `TypeError` in the cases where the input `other` is not of a compatible dtype or scalar.

On analyzing the `searchsorted` method, the potential error location seems to be at the point of conversion of the input `value` to a Timedelta. The error raised indicates that the function is expecting the input to be of specific compatible types, and in case it's not, it should ideally raise a `TypeError` and not `ValueError`.

The bug occurs because the function is not handling the input types correctly, and it's raising an incorrect error type. To fix this, the function should be updated to handle different input types and raise the appropriate errors as mentioned in the test cases.

Here's the corrected `searchsorted` function:

```python
def searchsorted(self, value, side="left", sorter=None):
    if isinstance(value, (np.ndarray, Index)):
        value = np.array(value, dtype=_TD_DTYPE, copy=False)
    elif isinstance(value, (float, int, np.datetime64, Timestamp, str)):
        value = Timedelta(value).asm8.view(_TD_DTYPE)
    else:
        raise TypeError("searchsorted requires compatible dtype or scalar")

    return self.values.searchsorted(value, side=side, sorter=sorter)
```
