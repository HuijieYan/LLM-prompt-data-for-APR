The error in the `searchsorted` method is due to the function trying to convert the `value` parameter to a `Timedelta` object in the following line:
```python
value = Timedelta(value).asm8.view(_TD_DTYPE)
```
This causes an error because the `value` parameter could be of various types, such as `int`, `float`, `datetime`, etc., and not necessarily a `Timedelta` object.

To fix this bug, the `searchsorted` method should only perform the conversion if the `value` is not already a `Timedelta` object. Otherwise, it should directly use the `value`.

Here's the corrected `searchsorted` method:

```python
def searchsorted(self, value, side="left", sorter=None):
    if not isinstance(value, Timedelta):
        value = Timedelta(value).asm8.view(_TD_DTYPE)

    return self.values.searchsorted(value, side=side, sorter=sorter)
```
In the corrected method, we first check if the `value` is not already a `Timedelta` object. If it is not, then we convert it to a `Timedelta` object before using it in the `searchsorted` operation. If it is already a `Timedelta` object, then we use it directly.

This will ensure that the `value` parameter is handled correctly, and the function won't raise a `ValueError` due to incorrect conversions.
