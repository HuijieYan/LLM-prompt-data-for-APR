The error messages from the test function indicate that the `searchsorted` method is not behaving as expected. The expected behavior, as described in the test cases, is that the method should return a `TypeError` when the input `other` does not match any of the expected types. However, the method is raising `ValueError` instead of `TypeError` in some cases.

Upon reviewing the code, it seems that the issue lies in the conversion of the `value` parameter to a Timedelta object in the `searchsorted` method. The method tries to convert the input `value` to a Timedelta using the `Timedelta(value)` constructor, which raises a `ValueError` when the input type does not match the expected types.

To fix this bug, the error handling in the `searchsorted` method needs to be modified to raise a `TypeError` when the input `value` does not match the expected types.

Here's the corrected code for the `searchsorted` method:

```python
def searchsorted(self, value, side='left', sorter=None):
    if not isinstance(value, (np.ndarray, Index)):
        raise TypeError("searchsorted requires compatible dtype or scalar")
    
    value = np.array(value, dtype=_TD_DTYPE, copy=False)

    return self.values.searchsorted(value, side=side, sorter=sorter)
```

By making this change, the `searchsorted` method will behave as expected and return a `TypeError` when the input `value` does not match the expected types.
