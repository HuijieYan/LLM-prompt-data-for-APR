Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the `Timedelta` class or the `Index` class, since it seems that the `value` is being converted to a `Timedelta` object and then to a numpy array.

Reason for the bug: The bug might be occurring due to the incorrect handling of the `value` variable, as it is being checked for its type and then converted, but the conversion process may not be accurate.

Approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Check if the `Timedelta` and `Index` classes are being used correctly to convert the `value` variable.
2. Verify if the `np.array` conversion is properly handling the `value` variable.
3. Confirm that the `_TD_DTYPE` and `asm8` variables are being used correctly.

Corrected code:

```python
def searchsorted(self, value, side="left", sorter=None):
    if isinstance(value, (np.ndarray, pd.Index)):
        value = np.array(value, dtype=_TD_DTYPE, copy=False)
    else:
        value = np.array(pd.Timedelta(value).asm8.view(_TD_DTYPE))

    return self.values.searchsorted(value, side=side, sorter=sorter)
```
