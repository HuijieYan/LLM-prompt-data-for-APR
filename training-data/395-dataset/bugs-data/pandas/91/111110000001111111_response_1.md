The bug in the provided code seems to be caused by the incorrect handling of the input parameter `value` in the `searchsorted` function. The function is expecting `value` to be of type `numpy.ndarray`, or `Index`. However, in all the test cases, `value` is passed as an integer, which causes the code to break.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to handle the case where `value` is an integer or float. This can be achieved by converting the input `value` to the appropriate type (`numpy.timedelta64`) before using it in the `searchsorted` method.

The corrected code for the `searchsorted` function is as follows:

```python
def searchsorted(self, value, side="left", sorter=None):
    if not isinstance(value, (np.ndarray, Index)):
        value = np.array([value], dtype='timedelta64[ns]')
    
    return self.values.searchsorted(value, side=side, sorter=sorter)
```
