The error message "ValueError: Value must be Timedelta, string, integer, float, timedelta or convertible, not Period" suggests that the problem lies within the `searchsorted` function. This function is designed to search for the position to insert the specified value into the array in order to maintain the order.

Looking at the function, the bug seems to be related to the handling of different data types for the `value` parameter.

The primary issue arises from the way the `value` parameter is being handled. When the `value` is not an instance of either an `np.ndarray` or `Index`, it's being converted into a `Timedelta` object, which is then converted into a NumPy datetime format (`asm8`) and viewed as a specific data type (`_TD_DTYPE`). The bug is likely occurring because the function does not appropriately handle various types passed in via the `value` parameter, such as `pd.Timestamp`, `np.datetime64`, or `pd.Timestamp.now().to_period("D")`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `searchsorted` function can handle different data types appropriately and make the necessary conversions when required.

Here's the corrected code for the `searchsorted` function:

```python
# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
from pandas._libs.tslibs.timedeltas import Timedelta, TimedeltaIndex
from pandas.core.arrays.timedeltas import TimedeltaArray

# Corrected searchsorted function
def searchsorted(self, value, side="left", sorter=None):
    if isinstance(value, (np.ndarray, pd.Index, TimedeltaArray)):
        value = np.array(value, dtype=_TD_DTYPE, copy=False)
    elif isinstance(value, (pd.Timestamp, np.datetime64, pd.Period)):
        value = Timedelta(value).asm8.view(_TD_DTYPE)
    else:
        value = Timedelta(value).asm8.view(_TD_DTYPE)

    return self.values.searchsorted(value, side=side, sorter=sorter)
``` 

The corrected function includes additional checks for handling different data types. It specifically checks for instances of `pd.Timestamp`, `np.datetime64`, and `pd.Period` before transforming them into the appropriate format for further processing. This should resolve the bug and allow the `searchsorted` function to handle various data types appropriately.
