It seems that the `searchsorted` method is not handling the input types correctly, which is causing the test cases to fail with various error messages such as `TypeError` and `ValueError`. The method should be able to handle different input types such as integers, floats, arrays, and timestamps.

Based on the error messages, the problem seems to occur when the method is trying to convert the input values to `Timedelta` objects. This conversion is causing a `ValueError` because the method is not able to handle all types of input values properly.

To fix this issue, the method should handle different input types appropriately, especially when converting them to `Timedelta` objects. It should also check for the compatibility of the input values with the array before performing the `searchsorted` operation.

Here is the corrected code for the `searchsorted` method:

```python
@Substitution(klass="TimedeltaIndex")
@Appender(_shared_docs["searchsorted"])
def searchsorted(self, value, side="left", sorter=None):
    if isinstance(value, (np.ndarray, Index)):
        value = np.array(value, dtype=_TD_DTYPE, copy=False)
    elif isinstance(value, (int, np.int64)):
        value = np.array(np.timedelta64(value, 'ns'))
    elif isinstance(value, float):
        value = np.array(np.timedelta64(int(value), 'ns'))
    elif isinstance(value, pd.Timestamp):
        value = np.array([value.value]).astype('timedelta64[ns]')
    else:
        raise TypeError("Value must be Timedelta, string, integer, float, timedelta or convertible.")

    if isinstance(value, np.ndarray):
        return self.values.searchsorted(value, side=side, sorter=sorter)
    else:
        raise TypeError("Value must be Timedelta, string, integer, float, timedelta or convertible.")
```

In the corrected code:
- We first handle arrays, integers, floats, and Timestamps separately to ensure that they are appropriately converted to the expected `numpy.timedelta64` type.
- We then perform the `searchsorted` operation if the input is an array.
- If the input is not an array, integer, float, or Timestamp, we raise a `TypeError` to indicate that it must be one of those types.

This corrected code should address the issues with handling different input types and ensure that the `searchsorted` method works as expected for various input values.
