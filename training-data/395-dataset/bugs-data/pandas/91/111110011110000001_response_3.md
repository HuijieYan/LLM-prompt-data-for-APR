The error occurs in the `searchsorted` method of the `TimedeltaIndex` class. The method is supposed to find the indices where the value should be inserted in order to maintain the order of the array. However, the method is raising `ValueError` and `TypeError` instead of handling the input types correctly.

The issue arises because the method attempts to convert the input `value` into a `Timedelta` object and then into a specific data type (`_TD_DTYPE`). This process can cause errors when the input `value` is not compatible, leading to the unexpected exceptions.

To fix this issue, the `searchsorted` method should handle various data types and object inputs properly. Instead of trying to convert every input into a `Timedelta` object and a specific data type immediately, it should check the input type first and handle it accordingly.

Here's the corrected `searchsorted` method for the `TimedeltaIndex` class:

```python
def searchsorted(self, value, side="left", sorter=None):
    if isinstance(value, (np.ndarray, pd.Index)):
        value = self._ensure_object(value)

    return self.values.searchsorted(value, side=side, sorter=sorter)
```

In this corrected method, the code checks if the `value` is an array or an index. If it is, the `_ensure_object` method is called to ensure that the input is in the correct format for further processing. Then, the method proceeds with the `searchsorted` operation on the values.

The `_ensure_object` method should handle the necessary conversion and validation for different input types to ensure that they are compatible for the `searchsorted` operation.

With this approach, the corrected method should be able to handle a wider range of input types and handle them appropriately, addressing the issues observed in the test cases.
