The error occurs in the `searchsorted` method of the `TimedeltaIndex` class. The method is failing to handle the input of different data types as expected, resulting in TypeError and ValueError exceptions.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the method is not checking the data type of the input correctly. It should handle different data types such as integers, floats, datetime64, and other pandas-specific types.

To fix the bug, the `searchsorted` method should be modified to handle different data types correctly. It should first check the data type of the input and take appropriate actions based on the type of data.

Here's the corrected code for the `searchsorted` method:

```python
def searchsorted(self, value, side="left", sorter=None):
    if isinstance(value, (np.ndarray, Index)):
        value = np.array(value, dtype=_TD_DTYPE, copy=False)
    elif np.issubdtype(type(value), np.datetime64):
        value = Timedelta(value).asm8.view(_TD_DTYPE)
    elif isinstance(value, (int, np.integer, float, str, pd.Timedelta)):
        value = Timedelta(value).asm8.view(_TD_DTYPE)
    else:
        raise TypeError("Unsupported data type for value")

    return self.values.searchsorted(value, side=side, sorter=sorter)
```

In this corrected code, we added checks for different data types such as np.datetime64, int, float, str, and pd.Timedelta before processing the `value`. This ensures that the method can handle a variety of input types correctly.
