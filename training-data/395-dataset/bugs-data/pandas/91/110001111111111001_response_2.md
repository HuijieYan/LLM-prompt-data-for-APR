The error message from the test functions indicates that the `searchsorted` function is not handling different types of input values properly. It is raising `ValueError` and `TypeError` instead of handling these cases more gracefully.

The potential location that may be causing the issue is the `if/else` block in the `searchsorted` function. It explicitly checks for the type of the input value (`isinstance(value, (np.ndarray, Index))`) and handles them accordingly. This restrictive handling causes errors when the input values are not of these specific types.

The `searchsorted` function should be updated to handle a wider range of input types and convert them appropriately if needed. It should be able to handle scalars, arrays, numbers, and other input types in a more consistent and robust manner.

The bug can be fixed by modifying the `searchsorted` function to provide better handling for the input types, such as checking for specific types and then converting them to a common type before processing.

The corrected code for the `searchsorted` function should be:

```python
def searchsorted(self, value, side='left', sorter=None):
    # Convert input value to a Timedelta if it's not already of that type
    if not isinstance(value, (pd.Timedelta, str, int, float)):
        value = pd.Timedelta(value)
    
    return self.values.searchsorted(value, side=side, sorter=sorter)
```

This modified function will handle a wider range of input types, converting them to `Timedelta` objects if they are not already in that format. This should resolve the issues observed in the test functions and prevent the `ValueError` and `TypeError` from being raised in these cases.
