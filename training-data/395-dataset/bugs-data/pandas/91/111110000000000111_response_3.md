The potential error in the provided code is that the function is trying to access `Timedelta` without importing it. This will result in a NameError.

To fix the bug, the `Timedelta` class needs to be imported from the pandas library to access its functionality.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected code for the problematic function
from pandas import Timedelta

# ... (other imports and class definition) ...

    def searchsorted(self, value, side='left', sorter=None):
        if isinstance(value, (np.ndarray, Index)):
            value = np.array(value, dtype=_TD_DTYPE, copy=False)
        else:
            value = Timedelta(value).asm8.view(_TD_DTYPE)
    
        return self.values.searchsorted(value, side=side, sorter=sorter)
```
