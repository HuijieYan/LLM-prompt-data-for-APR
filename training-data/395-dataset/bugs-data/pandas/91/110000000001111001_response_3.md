The potential error in the function is that the dtype is not being properly addressed. The code is trying to convert the input value into a timedelta, but it's not being done correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to properly check the type of the input value. If it's an array or Index, then it should be converted to an array with the correct dtype. If it's a single value, then it should be converted to a timedelta with the correct dtype.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import TimedeltaIndex, Timedelta

# this is the corrected function
@TimedeltaIndex._substitution(_shared_docs["searchsorted"])
def searchsorted(self, value, side="left", sorter=None):
    if isinstance(value, (np.ndarray, TimedeltaIndex)):
        value = np.array(value, dtype='timedelta64[ns]')
    else:
        value = np.timedelta64(value, 'ns')

    return self.values.searchsorted(value, side=side, sorter=sorter)
```
