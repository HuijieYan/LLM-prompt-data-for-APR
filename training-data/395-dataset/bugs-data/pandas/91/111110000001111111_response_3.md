The buggy function is a part of a class called TimedeltaIndex. The function searchsorted is used to find the indices where the input value would be inserted in the sorted array of self.values. However, the function is not written correctly, as it attempts to convert the input value into a timedelta64 object without proper checks for the input type.

The bug occurs because the code incorrectly assumes that the input value will always be a scalar (integer, float) or a numpy array, and it tries to convert the input into a timedelta object without proper type checking.

To fix the bug, the function should include type checking to handle different types of input appropriately. If the input value is an array, it should be converted into a timedelta object element-wise. If the input value is a scalar, it should be directly converted into a timedelta object.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def searchsorted(self, value, side="left", sorter=None):
    if isinstance(value, (np.ndarray, Index)):
        value = np.array(value, dtype=_TD_DTYPE, copy=False)
        value = np.array([np.timedelta64(v, 'ns') for v in value], dtype=_TD_DTYPE)
    else:
        value = np.timedelta64(value, 'ns')

    return self.values.searchsorted(value, side=side, sorter=sorter)
```

In this corrected code:
1. We first check if the input value is an array or a scalar.
2. If it's an array, we convert it into a timedelta object element-wise.
3. If it's a scalar, we directly convert it into a timedelta object using the np.timedelta64 function.
4. Then, we use the searchsorted method of self.values to find the indices where the converted value would be inserted in the sorted array.
