The bug in the `searchsorted` method seems to be the incorrect handling of different input types for the `other` parameter. The error messages from the test cases indicate that the method is not handling the input types properly, leading to `TypeError` or `ValueError` exceptions.

The potential error location within the method seems to be the part where the input `value` is converted to a `Timedelta`. The method should accept a broader range of input types and handle them accordingly.

The reasons behind the bug are likely related to insufficient handling of different input types for the `value` parameter. The current implementation restricts the input types that can be handled, leading to the observed errors.

To fix the bug, the `searchsorted` method needs to be updated to handle a wider range of input types for the `value` parameter. This can be achieved by checking the type of the input and applying appropriate conversions or operations based on the type. Additionally, proper error handling should be implemented to provide informative error messages for unsupported input types.

Here's the corrected code for the `searchsorted` method:

```python
def searchsorted(self, value, side="left", sorter=None):
    if isinstance(value, (np.ndarray, Index)):
        if isinstance(value, np.ndarray):
            value = np.array(value, dtype=_TD_DTYPE, copy=False)
        elif isinstance(value, Index):
            value = value.values
    elif isinstance(value, (int, np.integer, float, np.floating)):
        value = pd.Timedelta(value).to_timedelta64()
    elif np.issubdtype(np.datetime_data(value), np.datetime64):
        # Handle datetime64 input
        value = pd.Timedelta((value - np.datetime64('1970-01-01T00:00:00')) / np.timedelta64(1, 'ns')).to_timedelta64()

    return self.values.searchsorted(value, side=side, sorter=sorter)
```

In this corrected code, we handle different input types for the `value` parameter based on their type. If the input is an array or an index, we handle it accordingly. If it's an integer or a float, we convert it to a `Timedelta`. If it's a `datetime64`, we convert it to a `Timedelta` as well. This should cover a wider range of input types and resolve the issues observed in the test cases.
