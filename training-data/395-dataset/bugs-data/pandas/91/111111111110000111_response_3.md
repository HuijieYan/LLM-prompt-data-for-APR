The error in the test case is failing to raise a `TypeError` as expected, and instead raising a `ValueError`. This behavior indicates that the `searchsorted()` function is experiencing issues when handling different types of input. The bug appears to be related to incorrect handling of input data types within the `searchsorted()` function.

The `searchsorted()` function should handle input data types gracefully, including numpy arrays, Timestamps, and Periods. Currently, the function is unable to handle these data types, causing the test cases to fail. Additionally, the function is raising `ValueError` instead of the expected `TypeError` for certain input data types.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to update the `searchsorted()` function to handle various input data types correctly and consistently. It should also ensure that the appropriate exception (`TypeError`) is raised when incompatible data types are passed as input.

Here's the corrected code for the `searchsorted` function:

```python
def searchsorted(self, value, side='left', sorter=None):
    if isinstance(value, (np.ndarray, pd.TimedeltaIndex)):
        # Convert the values to the appropriate data type
        value = pd.TimedeltaIndex(value, freq='D')
    elif isinstance(value, (pd.Timestamp, pd.Period)):
        value = pd.Timedelta(value)

    return self.values.searchsorted(value, side=side, sorter=sorter)
```

In this corrected code, input values are converted to the appropriate data types before performing the search operation. Additionally, the 'side' and 'sorter' parameters are passed directly to the `searchsorted()` function on the 'values' attribute of the class.

These changes should address the issue with handling different input data types and ensure that the function raises a `TypeError` as expected.
