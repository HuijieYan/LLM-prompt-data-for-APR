The potential error in the problematic function is that it is trying to access the 'values' attribute of the self object without defining it anywhere in the code. This would result in an AttributeError.

To fix this bug, you can make use of the data attribute of the TimedeltaIndex class, which is initialized with the optional timedelta-like data passed to construct the index. You can then use this data attribute to perform the searchsorted operation on it.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@Substitution(klass="TimedeltaIndex")
@Appender(_shared_docs["searchsorted"])
def searchsorted(self, value, side="left", sorter=None):
    if isinstance(value, (np.ndarray, Index)):
        value = np.array(value, dtype=_TD_DTYPE, copy=False)
    else:
        value = Timedelta(value).asm8.view(_TD_DTYPE)

    if self.data is not None:
        return self.data.searchsorted(value, side=side, sorter=sorter)
    else:
        raise ValueError("No data available to perform searchsorted operation.")
```
