The error message "ValueError: Value must be Timedelta, string, integer, float, timedelta or convertible, not datetime64" indicates that there is an issue with the input validation in the `searchsorted` method of the `TimedeltaIndex` class. The method is expecting the input `value` to be of compatible types such as Timedelta, string, integer, float, timedelta, or convertible, but it's throwing a ValueError when a datetime64 type is passed as input.

The root cause of the issue seems to be that the input validation logic is too strict and doesn't handle datetime64 type as an acceptable input.

To fix this issue, the input validation logic in the `searchsorted` method needs to be updated to handle datetime64 type as an acceptable input. Additionally, the method should gracefully handle inputs that are not compatible types by raising a TypeError instead of a ValueError.

Here's the corrected version of the `searchsorted` method:

```python
def searchsorted(self, value, side="left", sorter=None):
    if not isinstance(value, (np.ndarray, Index, Timedelta, str, int, float)):
        raise TypeError("searchsorted requires compatible dtype or scalar")

    if isinstance(value, (np.ndarray, Index)):
        value = np.array(value, dtype=_TD_DTYPE, copy=False)
    elif isinstance(value, str):
        value = Timedelta(value).asm8.view(_TD_DTYPE)
    elif isinstance(value, np.datetime64):
        value = value.astype(_TD_DTYPE)

    return self.values.searchsorted(value, side=side, sorter=sorter)
```

With the above changes, the `searchsorted` method will handle a wider range of compatible input types and raise a TypeError for incompatible types instead of a ValueError.
