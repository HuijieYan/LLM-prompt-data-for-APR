The error message is indicating that there is an issue with the timezone (`tz` attribute) in the `DatetimeArray`. The original function seems to have issues with handling the timezone information correctly, leading to the test failures.

The potential error location within the problematic function could be the section that deals with the timezone parsing and conversions.

The bug occurs because the function is not correctly handling the timezone conversion for `DatetimeArray` objects, leading to mismatches in the test cases where timezone information is involved.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to properly handle the conversion and parsing of timezone information for `DatetimeArray` objects.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_listlike_datetimes(
    arg,
    box,
    format,
    name=None,
    tz=None,
    unit=None,
    errors=None,
    infer_datetime_format=None,
    dayfirst=None,
    yearfirst=None,
    exact=None,
):
    from pandas import DatetimeIndex
    from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray

    # Existing code...

    # This modified section below properly handles timezone conversion for DatetimeArray
    if isinstance(arg, DatetimeArray):
        if tz == "utc":
            arg = arg.tz_localize("UTC")
        return arg

    # Existing code...

    # The rest of the existing code remains unchanged

```

By making these adjustments to properly handle timezone conversion for `DatetimeArray`, the function should behave correctly and the test cases should pass without errors.
