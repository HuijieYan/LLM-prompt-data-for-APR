Potential error location: The code contains a few potential error locations due to the complexity of the function and the number of operations being performed.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The function is attempting to handle various types of input data, such as lists, tuples, ndarrays, Series, and Index. This level of complexity introduces potential issues with type handling and conversions.
2. The function attempts to handle different date formats and timezones, which increases the likelihood of logic errors and potential bugs.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Simplify the function by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable functions that each handle a specific type of input or date operation.
2. Utilize built-in pandas functions and utilities whenever possible to reduce the complexity and streamline the code.
3. Implement extensive error handling and testing to identify and catch potential issues with different types of input data and date formats.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def _convert_listlike_datetimes(
        arg,
        box,
        format,
        name=None,
        tz=None,
        unit=None,
        errors=None,
        infer_datetime_format=None,
        dayfirst=None,
        yearfirst=None,
        exact=None,
    ):
        from pandas import to_datetime
        
        # Use pandas 'to_datetime' to handle the date parsing and conversion
        result = to_datetime(arg, format=format, errors=errors, infer_datetime_format=infer_datetime_format,
                            dayfirst=dayfirst, yearfirst=yearfirst)
        
        if box:
            # Box the result as an Index-like if required
            result = result if isinstance(result, pd.DatetimeIndex) else pd.DatetimeIndex(result, name=name)
        else:
            # Return an ndarray of Timestamps
            result = result.to_numpy()
        
        return result
```
