The error message indicates that there is an assertion error related to the comparison of the `result` and `expected` objects in the `test_to_datetime_dta_tz` test case. The error message points specifically to a difference in the `tz` attribute of the `DatetimeArray` objects.

Upon reviewing the `to_datetime` function, it appears that the issue could be related to how time zones are handled during the conversion of datetime objects.

The bug occurs because the `to_datetime` function does not handle the time zone conversion correctly, leading to differences in the `tz` attribute between the `result` and `expected` objects. This results in the assertion error during the test case.

To fix the bug, the `to_datetime` function should ensure that the time zone information is properly preserved during the conversion process. This may involve using the appropriate methods or libraries to handle time zone conversions and ensure that the time zone information is consistent between the `result` and `expected` objects.

Below is the corrected code for the `to_datetime` function with the necessary modifications to address the time zone conversion issue:

```python
def _convert_listlike_datetimes(
    arg,
    box,
    format,
    name=None,
    tz=None,
    unit=None,
    errors=None,
    infer_datetime_format=None,
    dayfirst=None,
    yearfirst=None,
    exact=None,
    utc=None,  # added parameter for UTC conversion
):
    """
    Helper function for to_datetime. Performs the conversions of 1D listlike
    of dates
    """
    # existing code...

    if tz is not None and tz.lower() == "utc":
        utc = True  # Set UTC flag for time zone conversion

    # existing code...

    if box:
        if utc:  # Check if UTC conversion is needed
            result = DatetimeIndex(result, tz='UTC', name=name).tz_convert(tz)
        else:
            result = DatetimeIndex(result, tz=tz, name=name)
        return result

    else:
        if utc:  # Check if UTC conversion is needed
            result = objects_to_datetime64ns(
                result, dayfirst=dayfirst, yearfirst=yearfirst, utc=True, errors=errors
            )
        else:
            result = objects_to_datetime64ns(
                result, dayfirst=dayfirst, yearfirst=yearfirst, utc=False, errors=errors
            )

    return result
```

In this corrected code, a new `utc` parameter is added to the function to specify whether UTC conversion is required. Based on this parameter, the function handles the time zone conversions accordingly, ensuring consistent behavior and maintaining the time zone information between the `result` and `expected` objects.
