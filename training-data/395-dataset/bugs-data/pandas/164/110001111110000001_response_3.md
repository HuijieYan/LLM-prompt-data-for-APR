The error occurs when the `test_to_datetime_dta_tz` test function is executed. The purpose of this test is to check the `to_datetime` function using a given `DatetimeArray` or `DatetimeIndex` object and verifying if the result matches the expected output.

The error message indicates that the `tz` attribute of the `DatetimeArray` is different in the `result` compared to the `expected`. This implies that the `to_datetime` function is not handling the time zone localization correctly.

Upon analyzing the `_convert_listlike_datetimes` function, it seems that there might be an issue with the handling of time zones, especially with respect to `DatetimeArray`.

One possible approach to fixing this bug is to review the logic for time zone handling, particularly related to `DatetimeArray`. It's important to ensure that the time zone information is preserved correctly during the conversion process.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_listlike_datetimes(
    arg,
    box,
    format,
    name=None,
    tz=None,
    unit=None,
    errors=None,
    infer_datetime_format=None,
    dayfirst=None,
    yearfirst=None,
    exact=None,
):
    # ... (omitted code)
    
    if isinstance(arg, (list, tuple)):
        arg = np.array(arg, dtype="O")

    # these are shortcutable
    if is_datetime64tz_dtype(arg):
        # Handle timezone-aware datetime arrays
        # Preserve timezone information
        return DatetimeArray(arg, tz=tz, name=name)
    
    elif is_datetime64_ns_dtype(arg):
        if box and not isinstance(arg, (DatetimeArray, DatetimeIndex)):
            try:
                # Attempt to box the output as DatetimeIndex
                return DatetimeIndex(arg, tz=tz, name=name)
            except ValueError:
                pass

        return arg
    # ... (remaining code)
```
In the corrected code, specific handling for `DatetimeArray` objects has been added to ensure that the time zone information is preserved correctly. This should address the discrepancy in time zone attributes observed in the test results.
