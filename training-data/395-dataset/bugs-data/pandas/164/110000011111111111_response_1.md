Looking at the error message and the test function, it seems that the issue is related to the handling of time zones in the `to_datetime` function. The error suggests that the time zones are not being handled correctly, leading to differences in the expected and actual results.

After analyzing the provided buggy function and its usage in the test, it seems that there are some issues related to the handling of time zones and the conversion of datetime values.

The bug occurs because the function is not properly handling the conversion of datetime values to the specified time zone. This results in discrepancies between the expected and actual results, leading to test failures.

To fix the bug, the function `_convert_listlike_datetimes` needs to be reviewed and modified to ensure that datetime values are properly converted to the specified time zone. Additionally, the error handling and type conversion within the function should be carefully examined to address any potential issues related to time zone handling.

Below is the corrected version of the `_convert_listlike_datetimes` function:

```python
from pandas import DatetimeIndex

def _convert_listlike_datetimes(arg, box, format, name=None, tz=None, unit=None, errors=None, infer_datetime_format=None, dayfirst=None, yearfirst=None, exact=None):
    """
    Helper function for to_datetime. Performs the conversions of 1D listlike
    of dates

    ... (other parameters and descriptions remain the same)

    Returns
    -------
    ndarray of parsed dates
        Returns:

        - DatetimeIndex if box=True
        - ndarray of Timestamps if box=False
    """
    # (existing imports)

    if isinstance(arg, (list, tuple)):
        arg = np.array(arg, dtype="O")

    # (existing code for handling datetime types and units)
    
    # Handling time zone conversion
    if tz is not None:
        arg = arg.tz_localize(None)  # Remove any existing time zone information
        arg = arg.tz_localize(tz)  # Localize to the specified time zone

    if box:
        if isinstance(arg, DatetimeIndex):
            result = arg
        else:
            result = DatetimeIndex(arg, tz=tz, name=name)
    else:
        result = arg

    return result
```

In the corrected function, we explicitly handle time zone localization and conversion. We first remove any existing time zone information from the input datetime values and then localize them to the specified time zone (`tz`). Additionally, the return values are handled based on the `box` parameter, returning either a `DatetimeIndex` or an ndarray of Timestamps.

By making these modifications, the function should now properly handle time zone conversions and resolve the discrepancies observed in the test cases.
