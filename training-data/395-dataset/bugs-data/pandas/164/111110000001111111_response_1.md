The error occurs when attempting to call a method on the 'arg' object. The 'arg' object is assumed to be a pandas DatetimeIndex, but in some cases, it is a DatetimeArray. This results in errors when calling methods like tz_convert or tz_localize.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to determine the type of the 'arg' object and handle the operations accordingly. We can use the isinstance() method to check if the 'arg' object is a DatetimeArray and then call the appropriate methods. Additionally, we should handle other potential error cases such as when 'arg' is not a recognized type.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _convert_listlike_datetimes(arg, box, format, name=None, tz=None, unit=None, errors=None, infer_datetime_format=None, dayfirst=None, yearfirst=None, exact=None):
    """
    Helper function for to_datetime. Performs the conversions of 1D listlike of dates

    Parameters
    ----------
    (same as before...)

    Returns
    -------
    (same as before...)
    """
    from pandas import DatetimeIndex
    from pandas.core.arrays import DatetimeArray
    from pandas.core.arrays.datetimes import (
        maybe_convert_dtype,
        objects_to_datetime64ns,
    )

    if isinstance(arg, (list, tuple)):
        arg = np.array(arg, dtype="O")

    if isinstance(arg, DatetimeArray):
        if tz == "utc":
            arg = arg.tz_convert(None).tz_localize(tz)           
            # continue with the rest of the logic
        else:
            # handle non-utc case for DatetimeArray
            pass  # additional handling if needed

    # (rest of the function remains the same...)

```

In this corrected code, we first check if 'arg' is a DatetimeArray using the isinstance() method. If it is, we call the appropriate methods for handling the timezone conversion. Otherwise, the function continues as before.
