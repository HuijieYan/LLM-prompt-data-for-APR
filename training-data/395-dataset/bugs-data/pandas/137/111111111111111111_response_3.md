The error occurs due to a TypeError: data type not understood when merging the DataFrame on categorical columns that include intervals. The bug is in the astype method of the Categorical class, where the data type is not being understood.

The reason for this bug is that the astype method of the Categorical class is not handling the conversion from category to the extension type properly, leading to a TypeError.

To fix this bug, the astype method of the Categorical class should be modified to correctly handle the conversion from category to the extension type by checking the dtype and performing the necessary type conversion. This can be achieved by updating the logic to handle the conversion based on the dtype provided.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def astype(self, dtype: Dtype, copy: bool = True) -> ArrayLike:
    """
    Coerce this type to another dtype

    Parameters
    ----------
    dtype : numpy dtype or pandas type
    copy : bool, default True
        By default, astype always returns a newly allocated object.
        If copy is set to False and dtype is categorical, the original
        object is returned.
    """
    if is_categorical_dtype(dtype):
        dtype = cast(Union[str, CategoricalDtype], dtype)

        if isinstance(dtype, CategoricalDtype) and dtype != self.dtype:
            return self._set_dtype(dtype)

    return np.array(self, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)
```

With this modification, the astype method should now correctly handle the conversion from category to the extension type, and the TypeError should no longer occur when merging DataFrames on categorical columns that include intervals.
