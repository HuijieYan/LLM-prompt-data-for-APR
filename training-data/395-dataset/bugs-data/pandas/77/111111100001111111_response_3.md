The error seems to occur when the function `op` is trying to perform a logical operation between the numpy arrays `x` and `y`. The provided input parameters indicate that `x` is of type `ndarray` with a dtype of `int64`, and `y` is also an `ndarray` with a dtype of `object`. The function is designed to handle various data types, but it seems to be encountering an issue with the specific data types provided in this test case.

The bug may be related to the handling of the `op` function when operating on arrays with different dtypes. It appears that the function is trying to perform a logical operation between arrays of different dtypes, which may not be supported in this context.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to handle the logical operation between arrays with different dtypes more gracefully. One approach could be to explicitly convert both arrays to a common dtype before performing the logical operation. Another approach could be to handle the different dtype scenarios separately and apply the logical operation accordingly. 

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import ensure_object

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    if x.dtype.kind in ['i', 'b'] and y.dtype.kind in ['i', 'b']:
        # Both x and y are boolean or integer arrays
        result = op(x, y)
    else:
        x = ensure_object(x)
        y = ensure_object(y)
        result = op(x, y)
        
    return result
```

In the corrected code, we explicitly handle cases where both `x` and `y` are boolean or integer arrays, and then handle other cases by converting them to object arrays before performing the operation. This should provide a more robust handling of the different dtype scenarios encountered in the provided test case.
