The potential error in the code is the handling of the different types of input arrays (x and y) and the operations between them. The function seems to be trying to handle different data types such as integers, booleans, and arrays, but the handling is not well-defined and is leading to errors.

The bug is likely occurring because the function is not handling the different data types and their operations properly, leading to exceptions being raised during the execution of the code.

To fix the bug, the function should explicitly handle the different data types and their operations using proper type checking and handling. This will ensure that the function can handle a variety of input types and operations without raising exceptions.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y: np.ndarray, op):
    if not isinstance(x, np.ndarray) or not isinstance(y, np.ndarray):
        raise TypeError("Input parameters must be numpy arrays")

    if x.dtype.kind not in ['i', 'b'] or y.dtype.kind not in ['i', 'b']:
        raise TypeError("Input arrays must have integer or boolean dtype")

    if op not in [np.logical_and, np.logical_or, np.logical_xor]:
        raise ValueError("Unsupported operation. Only logical AND, OR, and XOR are supported")

    result = op(x, y)
    return result
```

In the corrected code:
- Type checking is performed to ensure that both input parameters x and y are numpy arrays.
- It is ensured that the input arrays x and y have either integer or boolean dtype, according to the original logic in the buggy function.
- The input operation "op" is also type-checked to ensure it is one of the supported logical operations (AND, OR, or XOR) from the numpy library.
- The operation is then carried out on the input arrays, and the result is returned.
