The error occurs when the `or_` operator is applied to the `left` and `right` arrays in the `test_na_logical_op_2d` test function. This error is due to the mismatched data types within the arrays.

Looking at the `na_logical_op` function, the potential error location is in the `try` block, where the `op` function (in this case `operator.or_`) is applied to the `x` and `y` arrays. The `op` function expects the same data type for both `x` and `y`, which is not upheld by the usage in the test case.

The reason behind the bug is that when the `op` function is applied to `x` and `y`, the data types are mismatched, resulting in a `TypeError` due to unsupported operand types for the bitwise OR operation.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle the mismatched data types between `x` and `y` before applying the `op` function. One possible approach is to check the data types of `x` and `y` and convert them to a consistent type before applying the `op` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `na_logical_op` function:

```python
def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    if x.dtype != y.dtype:  # Check if the data types match
        if x.dtype.kind in ['i', 'u'] and y.dtype.kind in ['f']:  # if x is int and y is float
            y = y.astype(x.dtype)  # convert y to int
        elif y.dtype.kind in ['i', 'u'] and x.dtype.kind in ['f']:  # if y is int and x is float
            x = x.astype(y.dtype)  # convert x to int

    result = op(x, y)  # Apply op after data type conversion
    return result
```

With this correction, the `na_logical_op` function now checks for data type mismatch and handles it by converting `y` to the data type of `x` or vice versa before applying the `op` function. This should resolve the issue encountered in the test case.
