The error message indicates that there is an unsupported operand type(s) for the logical OR operation in the `na_logical_op` function. The error occurs when attempting to perform the logical OR operation between an integer and a float.

The potential error location within the `na_logical_op` function is in the line `result = op(x, y)`, where the logical operation is being performed. The error occurs due to a mismatch in operand types, i.e., an integer and a float.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `op` function is being used directly with the input arrays `x` and `y` without considering their individual data types and compatibility for the logical operation.

To fix the bug, the `na_logical_op` function needs to handle the logical operation differently based on the data types of the input arrays. If the data types are not compatible for the operation, a proper method for handling such cases should be implemented.

Here's the corrected code for the `na_logical_op` function:

```python
def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    if isinstance(y, np.ndarray):
        result = libops.vec_binop(x, y, op)
    else:
        result = libops.scalar_binop(x, y, op)

    return result
```

In this corrected code, the function now checks whether `y` is an ndarray or not. If it is, the `vec_binop` method is used to perform the logical operation. If not, the `scalar_binop` method is used instead. This approach ensures that the logical operation is handled appropriately based on the data types of the input arrays.
