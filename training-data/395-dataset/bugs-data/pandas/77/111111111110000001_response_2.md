The test case `test_na_logical_op_2d` creates a 2-dimensional numpy array `left` and `right` and attempts to perform a logical OR operation on them using the `na_logical_op` function with the `operator.or_` function. The error message indicates that the `op` function is trying to perform a bitwise OR operation on an 'int' and a 'float', causing a TypeError.

The potential error location within the `na_logical_op` function is the section where it tries to use the `op` function (which is `operator.or_`) on the `x` and `y` arrays.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `operator.or_` is being applied directly to the arrays `x` and `y`, and the arrays are of type 'int' and 'float', causing a TypeError.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `na_logical_op` function to handle the case where the `op` function is the logical OR operation. We can use the `np.logical_or` function to achieve this.

Here's the corrected code for the `na_logical_op` function:

```python
import numpy as np

# this is the corrected function
def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    try:
        result = np.logical_or(x, y)
    except TypeError:
        if isinstance(y, np.ndarray):
            assert not (is_bool_dtype(x.dtype) and is_bool_dtype(y.dtype))
            x = ensure_object(x)
            y = ensure_object(y)
            result = libops.vec_binop(x, y, op)
        else:
            assert lib.is_scalar(y)
            if not isna(y):
                y = bool(y)
            try:
                result = libops.scalar_binop(x, y, op)
            except (
                TypeError,
                ValueError,
                AttributeError,
                OverflowError,
                NotImplementedError,
            ):
                typ = type(y).__name__
                raise TypeError(
                    f"Cannot perform '{op.__name__}' with a dtyped [{x.dtype}] array "
                    f"and scalar of type [{typ}]"
                )

    return result
```

With this correction, the function will use `np.logical_or` for logical OR operations, ensuring that the correct operation is performed for the given input arrays.
