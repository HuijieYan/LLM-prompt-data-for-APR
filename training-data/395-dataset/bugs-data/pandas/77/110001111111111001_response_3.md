The error message indicates a `TypeError` when the `na_logical_op` function tries to perform the logical OR operation (`|`) between an integer and a float. This occurs when the `operator.or_(left, right)` function is called within the test case, resulting in the error.

The potential error location within the `na_logical_op` function is in the line `result = op(x, y)`, where the logical operation is being performed. This is where the `TypeError` occurs.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not handling the logical operations properly when working with arrays of type `object`. It is not correctly falling back to the `vec_binop` branch as intended.

To fix the bug in the `na_logical_op` function, it is necessary to handle the logical operations specifically for arrays of type `object`. This involves implementing special handling for logical operations when dealing with arrays of type `object`. Additionally, the function should handle cases when `y` is an `np.ndarray` and when `y` is a scalar separately.

Below is the corrected code for the `na_logical_op` function:

```python
def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    xarr = isinstance(x, np.ndarray)
    yarr = isinstance(y, np.ndarray)
    xint = is_integer(x) or (xarr and x.dtype.kind == "i")
    xbool = is_bool(x) or (xarr and x.dtype.kind == "b")
    yint = is_integer(y) or (yarr and y.dtype.kind == "i")
    ybool = is_bool(y) or (yarr and y.dtype.kind == "b")

    try:
        if (xint or xbool) and (yint or ybool):
            result = op(x, y)
        else:
            if yarr:
                x = ensure_object(x)
                y = ensure_object(y)
                result = libops.vec_binop(x, y, op)
            else:
                if not isna(y) and not is_bool(y):
                    y = bool(y)
                result = libops.scalar_binop(x, y, op)
    except (
        TypeError,
        ValueError,
        AttributeError,
        OverflowError,
        NotImplementedError,
    ):
        typ = type(y).__name__
        raise TypeError(
            f"Cannot perform '{op.__name__}' with a dtyped [{x.dtype}] array "
            f"and scalar of type [{typ}]"
        )

    return result
``` 

In the corrected code, the logical operation is handled differently based on the types of `x` and `y`, and special handling for arrays of type `object` is implemented. This should resolve the `TypeError` and ensure the correct behavior of the function.
