Potential error location: The error may be occurring in trying to perform the logical operation (op) between x and y.

Reason for the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the code is not handling the different types of input arrays (x and y) properly. The code is also not handling the different data types of the input arrays appropriately.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the data types of x and y before performing the logical operation.
2. Handle different data types appropriately and perform type conversion if necessary.
3. Use built-in NumPy functions to handle logical operations between arrays.

Corrected code:
```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y: np.ndarray, op):
    try:
        # Check for data types and handle them appropriately
        if isinstance(y, np.ndarray):
            if x.dtype.kind in ["i", "b"] and y.dtype.kind in ["i", "b"]:
                result = op(x, y)
            else:
                x = x.astype(object)
                y = y.astype(object)
                result = np.vectorize(op)(x, y)
        else:
            if np.isscalar(y):
                if not np.isnan(y):
                    y = bool(y)
                result = op(x, y)
    except (
        TypeError,
        ValueError,
        AttributeError,
        OverflowError,
        NotImplementedError,
    ):
        typ = type(y).__name__
        raise TypeError(
            f"Cannot perform '{op.__name__}' with a dtyped [{x.dtype}] array "
            f"and scalar of type [{typ}]"
        )

    return result
```
