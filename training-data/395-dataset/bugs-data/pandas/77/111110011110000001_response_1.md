The test_na_logical_op_2d function contains a test case where the operator.or_ is applied to two arrays, left and right. The 'left' array is a 2x2 numpy array containing integers, while the 'right' array is also a 2x2 numpy array but contains objects. The (0, 0) element of the 'right' array is replaced with np.nan.

The error message indicates that the TypeError 'unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'int' and 'float'' is raised while performing the operation 'operator.or_' on the 'left' and 'right' arrays.

The issue is likely in the na_logical_op function. The error message suggests that the problem arises when the or_ operation is performed on the 'left' and 'right' arrays, particularly due to the data type discrepancies.

The bug occurs because the function na_logical_op is not handling the case where the 'right' array has a numpy nan value (np.nan) in its object elements properly. This results in a TypeError when performing logical operations.

To fix this bug, the na_logical_op function needs to account for the presence of nan values in the object array and handle it gracefully. This may involve converting the 'right' array to a different data type or performing the logical operation in a different approach.

Here is the corrected code for the na_logical_op function:

```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    # Check if y is a numpy array and handle the presence of nan values
    if isinstance(y, np.ndarray):
        y = np.where(np.isnan(y), False, y)
    
    # Perform the logical operation
    result = op(x, y)

    return result
```

In the corrected code, the y array is checked for nan values using np.isnan and replaced with False, ensuring it can be properly used in the logical operation with the x array. This will prevent the TypeError when performing the logical operation.
