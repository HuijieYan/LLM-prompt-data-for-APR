Potential Error Location:
The error seems to occur when the function `na_logical_op` tries to perform a logical operation using the `operator.or_` function on the `left` and `right` arrays.

Reasons Behind the Bug:
The error occurs due to the mismatched dimensions of the `left` and `right` arrays when the `vec_binop` function is called in the `except` block. The `vec_binop` function expects 1-dimensional arrays, but the `left` and `right` arrays provided are 2-dimensional.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the dimensions of the arrays `left` and `right` before performing the logical operation and perform appropriate reshaping if necessary.
2. Handle the case of 2-dimensional arrays in the `vec_binop` function to support operations on 2-dimensional arrays.

Corrected Code:
```python
import numpy as np
import operator
import pytest

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    try:
        result = op(x, y)
    except TypeError:
        if isinstance(y, np.ndarray):
            if x.ndim != 1 or y.ndim != 1:
                x = x.ravel()
                y = y.ravel()
            result = libops.vec_binop(x, y, op)
        else:
            assert lib.is_scalar(y)
            if not isna(y):
                y = bool(y)
            try:
                result = libops.scalar_binop(x, y, op)
            except (
                TypeError,
                ValueError,
                AttributeError,
                OverflowError,
                NotImplementedError,
            ):
                typ = type(y).__name__
                raise TypeError(
                    f"Cannot perform '{op.__name__}' with a dtyped [{x.dtype}] array "
                    f"and scalar of type [{typ}]"
                )

    return result
```

In the corrected code, the dimensions of the arrays `x` and `y` are checked before calling the `vec_binop` function. If either of the arrays has more than 1 dimension, they are flattened using the `ravel` method before performing the operation. This allows for correct handling of 2-dimensional arrays.
