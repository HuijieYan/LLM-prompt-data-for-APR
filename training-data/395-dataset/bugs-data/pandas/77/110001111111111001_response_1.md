The error occurs at the line `result = op(x, y)` within the `na_logical_op` function. The error message indicates that the operands 'int' and 'float' are not supported for the | (or) operation. Additionally, a separate error occurs at `libops.vec_binop(x, y, op)` which says that the buffer has the wrong number of dimensions.

The issue is that the function `na_logical_op` is attempting to apply the logical operation directly on `x` and `y` (operands) without performing any specific type checks or conversions. This leads to the error because the logical operation should not be applied directly to individual elements of the arrays.

To fix the bug:
1. We need to modify the function `na_logical_op` to perform element-wise logical operation on the provided arrays `x` and `y`.
2. Before applying the logical operation, we need to check the data type of the arrays and ensure that both `x` and `y` are of the same data type for the logical operation to be valid.
3. Additionally, we should handle the case where one of the arrays is a scalar value, and perform the necessary type conversions and checks before applying the logical operation.

Here's the corrected code for the `na_logical_op` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    # Check if the shapes of x and y are compatible
    if x.shape != y.shape:
        raise ValueError("Operands x and y must have the same shape for element-wise logical operation")
    
    # Check if the data types are compatible for the logical operation
    if x.dtype != y.dtype:
        raise ValueError("Operands x and y must have the same data type for element-wise logical operation")
    
    # Convert scalar y to boolean if necessary
    if np.isscalar(y):
        y = bool(y)
    
    # Perform element-wise logical operation
    result = op(x, y)
    
    return result
```
