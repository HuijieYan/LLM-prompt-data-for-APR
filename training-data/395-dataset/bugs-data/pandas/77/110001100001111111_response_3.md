The bug seems to be occurring when the function tries to perform the logical operation 'or_' between the numpy arrays x and y. The function is not handling the case where x and y have different dtypes properly. In this case, x has a dtype of 'int64' and y has a dtype of 'object'.

The bug occurs because the function is trying to perform a logical operation on arrays with different data types. This causes a TypeError to be raised.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to handle the case where x and y have different dtypes. We can convert both arrays to a common dtype before performing the logical operation.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    try:
        x = x.astype('float64')  # Convert x to a common dtype
        y = y.astype('float64')  # Convert y to a common dtype
        result = op(x, y)
    except TypeError:
        if isinstance(y, np.ndarray):
            assert not (is_bool_dtype(x.dtype) and is_bool_dtype(y.dtype))
            x = ensure_object(x)
            y = ensure_object(y)
            result = libops.vec_binop(x, y, op)
        else:
            assert lib.is_scalar(y)
            if not isna(y):
                y = bool(y)
            try:
                result = libops.scalar_binop(x, y, op)
            except (
                TypeError,
                ValueError,
                AttributeError,
                OverflowError,
                NotImplementedError,
            ):
                typ = type(y).__name__
                raise TypeError(
                    f"Cannot perform '{op.__name__}' with a dtyped [{x.dtype}] array "
                    f"and scalar of type [{typ}]"
                )

    return result
```

In the corrected function, we convert both input arrays x and y to the 'float64' dtype before performing the logical operation. This ensures that the logical operation can be performed without raising a TypeError due to mismatched dtypes.
