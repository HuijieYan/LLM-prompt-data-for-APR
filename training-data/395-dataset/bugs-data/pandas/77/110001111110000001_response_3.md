1. The test case `test_na_logical_op_2d` is attempting to test the behavior of the `na_logical_op` function when passed a 2D numpy array (`left` and `right`) and the logical OR operator.
2. The potential error location within the `na_logical_op` function is the line where the `op` function is called with `x` and `y` as arguments.
3. The error message indicates that the issue arises from an unsupported operand type for the logical OR (`|`) operation between an integer and a float, suggesting a problem with the input types.
4. To fix the bug, we need to address the handling of mismatched types when performing the logical OR operation and ensure consistency in the dimensions of the input arrays.
5. Here's the corrected code for the `na_logical_op` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    # Check if y is an ndarray and its dtype is object, if not, ensure it's an object array
    if not isinstance(y, np.ndarray) or y.dtype != object:
        y = np.array(y, dtype=object)
    
    try:
        result = op(x, y)
    except TypeError:
        x = x.astype(object)
        y = y.astype(object)
        result = op(x, y)

    return result
```
