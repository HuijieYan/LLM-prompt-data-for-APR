Potential error location: The error is likely occurring within the `na_logical_op` function, specifically in the `op(x, y)` line, where the numpy operation `or_` is being applied to the arrays `x` and `y`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug is likely occurring because the `or_` operation is not compatible with arrays of type `object` containing NaN values. This inconsistency is leading to a TypeError when trying to perform this operation.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if `y` contains NaN values and handle them appropriately before applying the `or_` operation.
2. Convert the arrays to a compatible type or handle the NaN values in a more suitable manner for the specific operation.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    try:
        result = op(x, y)
    except TypeError:
        if isinstance(y, np.ndarray):
            y_has_nan = np.isnan(y).any()
            if y_has_nan:
                y[np.isnan(y)] = False  # Replace NaN with False
            result = op(x, y)
        else:
            result = op(x, y)

    return result
```
