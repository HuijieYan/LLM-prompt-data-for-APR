The test case creates a 2D numpy array `left` and `right`, where `right` has a NaN value. It then attempts to call the `na_logical_op` function with the `operator.or_` function as the operation. The error message indicates that the code failed with a TypeError due to unsupported operand types for bitwise or (`|`) between an integer and a float.

The issue likely occurs in the `na_logical_op` function when it tries to perform the logical operation (`op`) on the input arrays `x` and `y`. The error occurs because the logical operation `or` is bitwise and should not be performed on arrays with different datatypes like 'int' and 'float'.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `na_logical_op` function to handle the logical operations between arrays of different datatypes. One possible approach is to cast all input arrays to a common datatype before performing the logical operation.

Below is the corrected code for the `na_logical_op` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    x = np.asarray(x)
    y = np.asarray(y)
    
    if x.dtype.kind in ['i', 'b'] and y.dtype.kind in ['i', 'b']:
        result = op(x, y)
    else:
        raise TypeError("Unsupported operand type for logical operation")

    return result
```

In the corrected code, we first convert `x` and `y` into numpy arrays using `np.asarray` to ensure they have the same data type. Then we perform the logical operation with the given `op` function. If the datatypes are not compatible, it raises a `TypeError` with an appropriate message.
