The test case is trying to call the `na_logical_op` function with arrays `left` and `right` and the operator `operator.or_`. The expected behavior is that `na_logical_op` should perform a logical OR operation on the corresponding elements of `left` and `right` arrays.

The error message suggests that the problem occurs within the `na_logical_op` function, specifically at the line `result = op(x, y)` where the TypeError `unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'int' and 'float'` is raised.

The issue arises because the logical operation is performed directly using the `op` function, which cannot handle the array with missing values (nan) and object dtype. This results in the TypeError.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `na_logical_op` function to handle missing values (nan) appropriately and perform logical operations on arrays with object dtype.

The corrected function for `na_logical_op` is as follows:

```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    # Handling NaN values in the array
    x = np.where(np.isnan(x), False, x)
    y = np.where(np.isnan(y), False, y)
    
    # Perform logical operation on arrays with object dtype
    if x.dtype.kind == 'O' or y.dtype.kind == 'O':
        x = x.astype(bool)
        y = y.astype(bool)
    
    # Perform logical operation using the specified operator
    result = op(x, y)
    
    return result
```

This updated function addresses the issue by handling the NaN values and casting arrays with object dtype to bool before performing the logical operation using the specified operator.

By making these changes, the `result` should now be calculated correctly, and the TypeError should be resolved.
