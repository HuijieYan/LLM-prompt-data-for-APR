The buggy function `na_logical_op` seems to be an element-wise operation on two arrays `x` and `y` using the `op` function. The bug seems to occur when the `y` array has a dtype of 'object'. This causes the operation to fail with a TypeError.

The issue might be due to the fact that the function is not handling the case where the dtype of `y` is 'object' properly. When `y` is an ndarray with dtype 'object', it is not being handled correctly within the function.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to handle the case where `y` has a dtype of 'object' properly by converting the dtype of `x` to 'object' as well before performing the operation. This will ensure that the operation can be carried out successfully regardless of the dtype of `x` and `y`.

Here's the corrected code for the `na_logical_op` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    x = x.astype(object)  # convert the dtype of x to object
    y = y.astype(object)  # convert the dtype of y to object
    
    try:
        result = op(x, y)
    except TypeError:
        if isinstance(y, np.ndarray):
            x = x.astype(float)  # convert x back to float if y is an ndarray
            
            result = op(x, y)
        else:
            assert np.isscalar(y)  # ensure y is a scalar
            if not np.isnan(y):  # convert y to bool if not NaN
                y = bool(y)
            result = op(x, y)

    return result
```

In the corrected code, we handle the case where `y` has a dtype of 'object' by first converting the dtype of both `x` and `y` to 'object' before performing the operation. This ensures that the operation will not fail due to dtype mismatches.
