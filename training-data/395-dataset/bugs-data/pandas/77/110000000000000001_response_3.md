Potential error location: The error is likely occurring when trying to perform the operation `op(x, y)`. There are multiple checks and conditions within the try-except block, so it's unclear which specific condition is causing the error.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug is likely caused by incorrect checks and conditions for the data types of `x` and `y`, as well as the operation `op`. This leads to the function not handling different data type combinations correctly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add explicit checks for the data types of `x` and `y` before performing the operation `op`.
2. Ensure that the function can handle different data type combinations, especially when `y` is an ndarray. 
3. Use appropriate type casting if needed to ensure that the operation can be performed.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    try:
        if isinstance(y, np.ndarray) and (x.dtype.kind in ['i', 'b'] or np.issubdtype(x.dtype, np.bool_)) and (y.dtype.kind in ['i', 'b'] or np.issubdtype(y.dtype, np.bool_)):
            result = op(x, y)
        else:
            x = np.array(x, dtype=object)
            y = np.array(y, dtype=object)
            result = op(x, y)
    except (
        TypeError,
        ValueError,
        AttributeError,
        OverflowError,
        NotImplementedError,
    ):
        typ = type(y).__name__
        raise TypeError(
            f"Cannot perform '{op.__name__}' with a dtyped [{x.dtype}] array "
            f"and scalar of type [{typ}]"
        )

    return result
```
