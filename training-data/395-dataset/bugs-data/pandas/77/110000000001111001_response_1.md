The problem in the provided function seems to be related to performing a logical operation between two NumPy arrays. When the logical operation is performed, the result is not as expected and some elements are converted to 'object' dtype or 'nan'. 

The shape and dtype of the input arrays x and y are appropriate for logical operation, but the mismatch in data types seems to be causing the issue. The dtype of array y is 'object' while x is 'int64'. This causes the logical operation to return an array of 'object' dtype.

To fix this issue, it is important to ensure that both input arrays x and y have the same dtype before performing the logical operation.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y: np.ndarray, op):
    # Ensure that the dtype of y is compatible with the dtype of x
    if y.dtype != x.dtype:
        try:
            y = y.astype(x.dtype)
        except ValueError:
            raise TypeError("Cannot perform logical operation with arrays of different data types")
    
    result = op(x, y)
    return result
```
