Potential error location:
The error may occur because of the if-else conditions within the try-except block. The code is trying to handle different types of input arrays and scalars, making it complex and prone to errors.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs due to the complexity of handling different types of input arrays and scalars. It may lead to incorrect handling of input types and operations, resulting in unexpected errors.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Simplify the function by removing unnecessary if-else conditions and handling different input types separately.
2. Use explicit type checking and conversion to ensure that the input types are compatible with the operations being performed.
3. Refactor the function to have separate code paths for handling arrays and scalars, reducing the complexity and improving error handling.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y: np.ndarray, op):
    try:
        result = op(x, y)
    except TypeError:
        if isinstance(y, np.ndarray):
            x = x.astype(object)
            y = y.astype(object)
            result = x & y  # Example logical operation, replace with the actual operation to be performed
        else:
            # Handle scalar value
            try:
                result = x & y  # Example logical operation, replace with the actual operation to be performed
            except (
                TypeError,
                ValueError,
                AttributeError,
                OverflowError,
                NotImplementedError,
            ):
                typ = type(y).__name__
                raise TypeError(
                    f"Cannot perform '{op.__name__}' with a dtyped [{x.dtype}] array "
                    f"and scalar of type [{typ}]"
                )

    return result
```
