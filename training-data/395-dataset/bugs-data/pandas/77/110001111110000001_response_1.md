The test case `test_na_logical_op_2d` involves comparing two 2D arrays - `left` and `right` - using the logical OR operator. The `right` array is initialized with an object data type, and the element at position [0, 0] is set to `np.nan`.

The error message indicates a `TypeError` within the `na_logical_op` function, specifically at the line `result = op(x, y)`. This suggests that there is a mismatch in data types when trying to perform the logical OR operation between the elements of `left` and `right`.

The bug occurs because the function is not handling the case of performing logical operations between integer and floating point values. When the function attempts to perform the logical OR operation between an integer and a float due to the presence of `np.nan`, it raises a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug:
1. Handle the case where `np.nan` is present in the `y` array, which potentially causes a mismatch in data types when performing logical operations.
2. Modify the function to check for the presence of `np.nan` in the `y` array, and cast the elements to the appropriate data type for the logical operation to proceed successfully.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic `na_logical_op` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    if np.isnan(y).any():  # Check if y contains np.nan
        y = np.where(np.isnan(y), False, y)  # Replace np.nan with False
    result = op(x, y)
    return result
```

With this correction, the function checks for the presence of `np.nan` in the `y` array, replaces it with `False`, and then performs the logical operation. This ensures that the logical operation can proceed without raising a `TypeError` due to mismatched data types.
