The error message indicates that the `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'int' and 'float'` occurs when trying to perform the logical OR operation (`|`) on arrays. This error is likely caused by the mismatch of operand types between the 'int' and 'float' data types within the arrays.

Looking at the code, the problematic function `na_logical_op` attempts to perform the logical operation between arrays `x` and `y` using the `op` function (in this case, `operator.or_` for logical OR). The error arises because the `op` function is applied directly to the arrays `x` and `y`, resulting in the type mismatch.

To fix this bug, the function needs to check the data types of the arrays and handle different cases accordingly. For instance, if `op` is a bitwise OR operation (e.g., `np.bitwise_or`), the function should check if the types of `x` and `y` are compatible for the operation.

Based on this analysis, the corrected code for the `na_logical_op` function is as follows:

```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    # Check if the types of x and y are compatible for the operation
    if x.dtype.kind in ['i', 'b'] and (y.dtype.kind in ['i', 'b'] or isinstance(y, np.ndarray)):
        result = op(x, y)
    elif is_bool_dtype(x.dtype) and is_bool_dtype(y.dtype):
        # Handle boolean dtype operations
        result = libops.vec_binop(x, y, op)
    elif lib.is_scalar(y):
        # Handle scalar case
        if not isna(y):
            y = bool(y)
        result = libops.scalar_binop(x, y, op)
    else:
        typ = type(y).__name__
        raise TypeError(
            f"Cannot perform '{op.__name__}' with a dtyped [{x.dtype}] array "
            f"and scalar of type [{typ}]"
        )
    return result
```

In the corrected code, additional checks have been added to ensure that the operation is performed based on the compatible types of arrays `x` and `y`. Also, the handling of boolean dtype operations and scalar cases has been adjusted to prevent type mismatch errors.
