Potential Error Location: The error might be in the line `result = op(x, y)` where the operation is applied directly to the `x` and `y` arrays.

Reason for Bug: The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where `y` is a numpy ndarray with dtype 'O' (object). As a result, it encounters a TypeError when trying to perform the operation directly.

Approach for Fixing the Bug: We need to handle the case where `y` is a numpy ndarray with dtype 'O' separately. This can be achieved by modifying the exception handling block to first check if `y` is a numpy ndarray and then handle the necessary operations accordingly.

Corrected Code:

```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    try:
        result = op(x, y)
    except TypeError:
        if isinstance(y, np.ndarray) and y.dtype.kind == 'O':
            x = x.astype('O')
            y = y.astype('O')
            result = np.array([op(xi, yi) for xi, yi in zip(x, y)], dtype='object')
        elif isinstance(y, np.ndarray):
            assert not (np.issubdtype(x.dtype, np.bool_) and np.issubdtype(y.dtype, np.bool_))
            x = np.asarray(x)
            y = np.asarray(y)
            result = np.array([op(xi, yi) for xi, yi in zip(x, y)], dtype='object')
        else:
            assert np.isscalar(y)
            if not np.isnan(y):
                y = bool(y)
            try:
                result = op(x, y)
            except (
                TypeError,
                ValueError,
                AttributeError,
                OverflowError,
                NotImplementedError,
            ):
                typ = type(y).__name__
                raise TypeError(
                    f"Cannot perform '{op.__name__}' with a dtyped [{x.dtype}] array "
                    f"and scalar of type [{typ}]"
                )
    return result
```

This corrected code handles the case where `y` is a numpy array with dtype 'O' separately and performs the necessary operations accordingly. Additionally, it includes the necessary checks and type conversions to ensure proper handling of different data types.
