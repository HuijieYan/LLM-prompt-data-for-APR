The buggy function `na_logical_op` is meant to perform a logical operation between two numpy arrays `x` and `y` using the operator `op`. The error seems to occur when trying to perform the operation using the `op` on `x` and `y`.

The error message mentions a TypeError and indicates that it cannot perform the given operation with the specified data types for `x` and `y`. This suggests that the data types of `x` and `y` are not compatible for the operation.

Upon examining the input parameter types and values, it can be seen that `x` is an ndarray with dtype `'int64'`, and `y` is also an ndarray but with dtype `'O'` (object). The operation being passed, `op.__name__` is `'or_'`.

The bug seems to occur due to the mismatch in data types of `x` and `y`. The function is unable to perform the logical operation with the given types.

To fix this bug, the function needs to handle the mismatch in data types between `x` and `y`. One possible approach is to convert the dtype of array `y` to be compatible with the dtype of array `x` before performing the operation.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    try:
        result = op(x, y)
    except TypeError:
        y = y.astype(x.dtype)  # Convert the dtype of y to match the dtype of x
        result = op(x, y)

    return result
```

In the corrected function, before attempting the logical operation, the dtype of array `y` is converted to match the dtype of array `x` using the `astype` method. This will ensure that the operation can be performed without type compatibility issues.
