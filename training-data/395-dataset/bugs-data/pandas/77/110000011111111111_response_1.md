The error message indicates that the `operator.or_` function is being applied to arrays of type int and float, which is causing a TypeError. This error occurs in the `na_logical_op` function, specifically in the line `result = op(x, y)`.

The bug occurs because the `op` function should be applied element-wise to the arrays `x` and `y`, but instead, it's being applied to the arrays as a whole, leading to mismatched types.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `op` function is applied element-wise to the arrays `x` and `y`. We can do this by using the `np.logical_or` function, which is the element-wise logical OR operation in NumPy.

Here's the corrected code for the `na_logical_op` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    result = np.logical_or(x, y)
    return result
```

By using `np.logical_or`, we ensure that the logical OR operation is applied element-wise to the arrays `x` and `y`, fixing the bug that was causing the TypeError.
