The error message shows that the buggy function `na_logical_op` raises a TypeError when trying to perform the logical OR operation (`operator.or_`) between arrays `x` and `y`.

Looking at the error message and the code, the issue appears to be related to the handling of NaN values in the `y` array, which has a dtype of object. The function fails when trying to perform a logical operation between different data types within the `x` and `y` arrays.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle NaN values correctly when performing the logical operation. Additionally, the function does not handle the different data types properly, leading to the ValueError during the fallback to the `libops.vec_binop` function.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `na_logical_op` function to handle NaN values and different data types properly when performing the logical operation. We should also ensure that the fallback to `libops.vec_binop` handles the input arrays correctly.

Here's the corrected `na_logical_op` function:

```python
def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    try:
        result = op(x, y)
    except TypeError:
        if isinstance(y, np.ndarray):
            x = ensure_object(x)
            y = ensure_object(y)
            result = libops.vec_binop(x, y, op)
        else:
            if not isna(y):
                y = bool(y)
            x = ensure_object(x)
            result = libops.vec_binop(x, y, op)

    return result
```

In the corrected function, we ensure that the input arrays `x` and `y` are converted to objects if needed before performing the logical operation. Additionally, we handle the NaN values and different data types properly. This should prevent the TypeError and ValueError that were occurring in the original buggy function.
