The error message is indicating a type error: "TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'int' and 'float'." This suggests that the bitwise OR operation ("|") is being performed between an integer and a float, which is not supported.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the line `result = op(x, y)`, where the bitwise OR operation is being performed using the function `op`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not handling the case where the input arrays have missing or non-integer values correctly.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to handle missing or non-integer values properly. We can use numpy's logical_or function to perform the bitwise OR operation, which will handle missing values and different data types correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    result = np.logical_or(x, y)
    return result
```

With this modification, the function will correctly handle missing or non-integer values and perform the bitwise OR operation using numpy's logical_or function.
