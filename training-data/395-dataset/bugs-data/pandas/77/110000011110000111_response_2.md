The test case `test_na_logical_op_2d` creates a 2D numpy array `left` and `right` with the `object` dtype and a NaN value in `right[0, 0]`. It then calls the `na_logical_op` function with `left`, `right`, and the `operator.or_` function as parameters. This test case expects that `result = na_logical_op(left, right, operator.or_)` should work without errors.

The error message indicates that the specific line causing the error is `result = op(x, y)`. It shows a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'int' and 'float'`.

The root cause of the error is that when the `operator.or_` function (which performs a logical OR operation) is called with the `left` and `right` arrays, it encounters a mismatch in data types ('int' and 'float'). This is likely due to the presence of the NaN value in the `right` array, causing data type inconsistency.

To fix this issue:
1. We could modify the `na_logical_op` function to handle the case where the dtype of the arrays is 'object' and one of the elements is NaN. 
2. The function should check for the presence of NaN and handle it appropriately to avoid data type mismatches when performing the logical operation.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    if x.dtype.kind == "O" and y.dtype.kind == "O":  # Check if both arrays have dtype 'object'
        if np.isnan(y).any():  # Handle NaN values in y array
            # Convert y to boolean array with NaN as False
            y = np.where(np.isnan(y), False, y.astype(bool))

    result = op(x, y)  # Perform the logical operation after handling NaN values

    return result
``` 

In the updated function, we first check if both input arrays have dtype 'object'. If this condition is met and the `y` array contains NaN values, we convert `y` to a boolean array with NaN as False. This ensures that when the logical operation is performed, the data types are compatible and it avoids the TypeError encountered in the original code.

With this fix, the `na_logical_op` function should handle the case where one of the arrays has NaN values and perform the logical operation correctly.
