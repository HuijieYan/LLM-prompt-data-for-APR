The potential error in the buggy function lies in the handling of the operation 'or_' on the input arrays x and y. The function seems to be trying to perform a logical 'or' operation between x and y using the `or_` function from numpy, but it is not handling the NaN values present in the y array.

The error is occurring because NaN values are not handled properly in the logical operation. The code is attempting to perform a logical operation on arrays x and y without considering the presence of NaN values. This results in a TypeError being raised, as the operation cannot be performed directly on arrays containing NaN.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the NaN values in the input arrays before performing the logical 'or' operation. We can do this by converting the arrays to a boolean type and replacing the NaN values with a specific boolean value, such as False.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    x_bool = np.isnan(x)
    y_bool = np.isnan(y)
    x[x_bool] = False
    y[y_bool] = False

    result = op(x.astype(bool), y.astype(bool))
    
    return result
```
