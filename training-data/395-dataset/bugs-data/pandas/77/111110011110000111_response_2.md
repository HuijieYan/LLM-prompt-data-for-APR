The error message indicates that when using the `or_` operator with the `na_logical_op` function, a TypeError is raised due to unsupported operand types for bitwise OR: 'int' and 'float'. Additionally, a ValueError is raised in the `vec_binop` function with the message "Buffer has wrong number of dimensions (expected 1, got 2)".

Upon examining the `na_logical_op` function, it is apparent that the issue arises from the line `result = op(x, y)`. This line is trying to perform the logical operation directly on the arrays `x` and `y`, which causes the TypeError when the types of the elements in `x` and `y` are incompatible for the operation. The ValueError in `vec_binop` is likely a consequence of the previous TypeError.

The bug occurs because the function is attempting to perform the logical operation directly on the input arrays, without first properly handling any potential NaN values in the arrays.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle NaN values and any potential type mismatches between `x` and `y` before attempting the logical operation using the `op` function.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    x = np.asarray(x)
    y = np.asarray(y)
    
    if np.isnan(y).any():
        result = np.where(np.isnan(y), True, op(x, y))
    else:
        result = op(x, y)
        
    return result
```
