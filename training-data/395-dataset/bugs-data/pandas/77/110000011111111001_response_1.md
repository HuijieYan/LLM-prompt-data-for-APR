The error occurs in the `na_logical_op` function when it tries to perform the logical operation `or_` on the arrays `x` and `y`. The error message indicates that the operation is unsupported due to incompatible operand types ('int' and 'float').

The potential error in the `na_logical_op` function is the direct use of the `op` function to perform the logical operation between arrays `x` and `y`. This approach is not handling the specific case where one of the operands is `nan`.

The bug occurs because the `na_logical_op` function does not handle the case where one of the operands is `nan`, causing the unsupported operand type error to occur.

To fix this bug, one possible approach is to implement custom logic within the `na_logical_op` function to handle the `nan` values and perform the logical operation accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function with added logic to handle the 'nan' values:

```python
import numpy as np
import operator

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    if np.isnan(x).any() or np.isnan(y).any():
        result = np.isnan(x) | np.isnan(y)
    else:
        result = op(x, y)

    return result
```
