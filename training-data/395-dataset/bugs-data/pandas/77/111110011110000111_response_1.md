The test case `test_na_logical_op_2d` creates a 2D array `left` and `right` where one element in `right` is `np.nan`. It then tries to perform a logical OR operation between `left` and `right` using the `na_logical_op` function, which is expected to handle the `np.nan` value appropriately.

The error message indicates that the issue occurs when trying to perform the logical OR operation (`operator.or_`) with the `np.nan` value in the `right` array.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line:
```python
result = op(x, y)
```

The bug occurs because the logical OR operation using `operator.or_` cannot handle the `np.nan` value in the `right` array. Additionally, the function tries to apply the logical OR operation directly to the input arrays `x` and `y`, which does not handle the `np.nan` value as expected.

To fix the bug, the function should explicitly handle the `np.nan` value and perform the logical OR operation accordingly. Additionally, a check for `np.nan` values should be added to handle them appropriately.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    if isinstance(y, np.ndarray):
        masked_x = np.ma.masked_invalid(x)
        masked_y = np.ma.masked_invalid(y)
        result = op(masked_x, masked_y)
        result = np.where(masked_x.mask | masked_y.mask, np.nan, result)
    else:
        if np.isnan(y):
            y = bool(y)
        result = op(x, y)
    return result
```
