1. The test case involves calling the function `na_logical_op` with two 2D arrays - `left` and `right`, and the operation `operator.or_`. This test case aims to ensure that when a numpy operation on 2D arrays encounters a TypeError, it falls back to the `vec_binop` branch.
2. The error occurs in the `na_logical_op` function where the `op` (operation) is applied directly to the input arrays `x` and `y`. This leads to a TypeError when operating on arrays with different dtypes.
3. The bug occurs because the function does not handle the scenario where the dtypes of array `x` and array `y` are different (in this case, 'int' and 'float').
4. One approach to fixing the bug is to update the function to handle the scenario when the dtypes of the input arrays `x` and `y` are different. This can be achieved by properly identifying the dtypes and handling the operations accordingly.
5. Here is the corrected code for the `na_logical_op` function:

```python
def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    try:
        result = op(x, y)
    except TypeError:
        # Check if both x and y are ndarrays
        if isinstance(y, np.ndarray):
            # Ensure both x and y have the same dtype
            if x.dtype != y.dtype:
                y = y.astype(x.dtype)
            result = libops.vec_binop(x, y, op)
        else:
            # Handle scalar values by converting to bool if not NA
            if not pd.isna(y):
                y = bool(y)
            result = libops.scalar_binop(x, y, op)

    return result
```

In this corrected code, the function first checks if both `x` and `y` are ndarrays. If so, it ensures that they have the same dtype, converting `y` to match the dtype of `x` if it's different. Then, it proceeds with the operation using `libops.vec_binop`. If `y` is not an ndarray, it handles scalar values by converting them to bool if they are not NA, and then proceeds with the operation using `libops.scalar_binop`.
