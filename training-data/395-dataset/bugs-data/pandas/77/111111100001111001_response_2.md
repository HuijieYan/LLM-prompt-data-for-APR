The buggy function `na_logical_op` is meant to perform a logical operation `op` between arrays `x` and `y`. The issue arises when trying to perform the operation in the line `result = op(x, y)`. This leads to a `TypeError` in the case where `y` is an `ndarray`.

The function is incorrectly handling the case where `y` is an `ndarray` with a dtype of `'O'` (object). The dtype of `'O'` is leading to the error when trying to perform the logical operation between `x` and `y`.

To fix this issue, the function should handle the case where `y` is an `ndarray` with a dtype of `'O'` separately by first converting `x` to an array with dtype `'O'` if it is not already of that type. Then the logical operation can be performed using `libops.vec_binop` instead of the regular operation.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    try:
        result = op(x, y)
    except TypeError:
        if isinstance(y, np.ndarray) and y.dtype.kind == "O":
            x = ensure_object(x)  # Convert x to object type if not already
            y = ensure_object(y)
            result = libops.vec_binop(x, y, op)  # Perform logical op using vec_binop
        else:
            # rest of the code as is
            pass
    return result
```
