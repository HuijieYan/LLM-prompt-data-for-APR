The error message "TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'int' and 'float'" is being raised in the `na_logical_op` function when using the `operator.or_` function on arrays `x` and `y` with types 'int' and 'float' respectively.

The bug is likely occurring in the `except TypeError` block of the `na_logical_op` function, where it falls back to the `libops.vec_binop` function. This is evident from the error message which states that there is a "ValueError: Buffer has wrong number of dimensions (expected 1, got 2)" within the `libops.vec_binop` function.

The bug occurs because the function is not properly handling the `operator.or_` function with arrays of mixed types. It is trying to perform a bitwise OR operation on arrays `x` and `y` which have different dtypes ('int64' and 'O'). This leads to a mismatch and causes the type error.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `except TypeError` block to handle the case of arrays with different dtypes more gracefully. We can convert the data type of `y` to match that of `x` before performing the operation.

Here's the corrected code for the `na_logical_op` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    try:
        result = op(x, y)
    except TypeError:
        if isinstance(y, np.ndarray):
            x = x.astype(object)
            y = y.astype(object)
            result = libops.vec_binop(x, y, op)
        else:
            assert lib.is_scalar(y)
            if not pd.isna(y):
                y = bool(y)
            try:
                result = libops.scalar_binop(x, y, op)
            except (
                TypeError,
                ValueError,
                AttributeError,
                OverflowError,
                NotImplementedError,
            ):
                typ = type(y).__name__
                raise TypeError(
                    f"Cannot perform '{op.__name__}' with a dtyped [{x.dtype}] array "
                    f"and scalar of type [{typ}]"
                )

    return result
```
