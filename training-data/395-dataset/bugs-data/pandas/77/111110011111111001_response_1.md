Potential error location: The potential error location is within the `try` block where the `result` variable is assigned a value using the given `op` function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the `op` function (in this case, `operator.or_`) is being applied to the `x` and `y` arrays, and the types of the elements of these arrays are not compatible for the bitwise `or` operation. This results in a `TypeError` being raised.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The `op` function should be modified to work with the given arrays, or a different approach should be used to perform the logical operation. One approach could be to explicitly handle the logical `or` operation on the arrays and achieve the desired result.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    try:
        result = np.logical_or(x, y)
    except TypeError:
        if isinstance(y, np.ndarray):
            assert not (isinstance(x, np.bool_) and isinstance(y, np.bool_))
            x = np.asarray(x, object)
            y = np.asarray(y, object)
            result = np.vectorize(op)(x, y)
        else:
            assert np.isscalar(y)
            if not np.isnan(y):
                y = bool(y)
            try:
                result = np.vectorize(op)(x, y)
            except (
                TypeError,
                ValueError,
                AttributeError,
                OverflowError,
                NotImplementedError,
            ):
                typ = type(y).__name__
                raise TypeError(
                    f"Cannot perform '{op.__name__}' with an array of [{x.dtype}] and a scalar of type [{typ}]"
                )

    return result
```

This corrected code uses the `np.logical_or` function to perform the logical `or` operation on the arrays `x` and `y`. It also handles cases where the operands are not compatible by using `np.vectorize` to apply the given `op` function to the arrays.
