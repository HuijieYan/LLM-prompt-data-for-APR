The test case is designed to check the behavior of the na_logical_op function. The function is expected to handle logical operations between two arrays, with a fallback to a different branch (vec_binop) if necessary. 

The error message indicates a TypeError when using the operator.or_ function, which is likely due to unsupported operand types for the logical OR operation.

The issue in the provided function seems to be related to the handling of the logical operation between arrays. It seems that the function does not correctly handle the logical OR operation between two arrays of different types, specifically when dealing with NaN values.

One approach to fixing this issue would be to modify the logical operation implementation within the na_logical_op function to handle NaN values and different data types appropriately. This may involve checking for NaN values, ensuring consistent data types, and handling the logical operation accordingly.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    try:
        result = op(x, y)
    except TypeError:
        if isinstance(y, np.ndarray):
            if np.isnan(y).any():
                y = np.where(np.isnan(y), False, y)
            x = x.astype(bool)
            y = y.astype(bool)
            result = op(x, y)
        else:
            if not np.isnan(y):
                y = bool(y)
            x = x.astype(bool)
            result = op(x, y)
    return result
```

This corrected function handles the scenario where `y` is an ndarray and contains NaN values. It converts both `x` and `y` to boolean arrays and handles the logical operation accordingly, taking into account any NaN values present.
