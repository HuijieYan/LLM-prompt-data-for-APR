The test case `test_na_logical_op_2d` creates a 2D numpy array `left` and `right` with the same shape. `right` is then modified to set the value at [0, 0] to `np.nan`. The test then attempts to use the `na_logical_op` function with `operator.or_` on `left` and modified `right`. This is intended to be a logical OR operation between the elements of `left` and `right`.

The error message indicates a `TypeError` when attempting the logical OR operation. It also shows a `ValueError` when attempting the `libops.vec_binop` function, indicating that the buffer has the wrong number of dimensions.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the logical OR operation in the `try` block, where the `result` is assigned the value of the operation `op(x, y)`. This is likely where the `TypeError` is being raised.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that np.nan is treated as a float, and when the logical OR operation is performed between an integer and a float, it raises a `TypeError`.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `y` is a `float` and convert it to a `bool`. We should also ensure that the array `x` and `y` are of the same data type before performing the operation.

Here's the corrected code for the `na_logical_op` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    try:
        # Convert to bool if y is np.nan
        if isinstance(y, np.ndarray) and np.isnan(y).any():
            y = np.isnan(y)
        
        # Make sure x and y have the same data type
        if x.dtype != y.dtype:
            y = y.astype(x.dtype)

        result = op(x, y)
    except TypeError:
        if isinstance(y, np.ndarray):
            # bool-bool dtype operations should be OK, should not get here
            assert not (is_bool_dtype(x.dtype) and is_bool_dtype(y.dtype))
            x = ensure_object(x)
            y = ensure_object(y)
            result = libops.vec_binop(x, y, op)
        else:
            # let null fall thru
            assert lib.is_scalar(y)
            if not isna(y):
                y = bool(y)
            try:
                result = libops.scalar_binop(x, y, op)
            except (
                TypeError,
                ValueError,
                AttributeError,
                OverflowError,
                NotImplementedError,
            ):
                typ = type(y).__name__
                raise TypeError(
                    f"Cannot perform '{op.__name__}' with a dtyped [{x.dtype}] array "
                    f"and scalar of type [{typ}]"
                )

    return result
```

With these changes, the function will handle the case where `y` is `np.nan` by converting it to a `bool` and ensure that `x` and `y` have the same data type before performing the operation.
