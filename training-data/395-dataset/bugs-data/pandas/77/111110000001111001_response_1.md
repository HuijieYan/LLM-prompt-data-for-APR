The potential error location within the function is in the line `result = op(x, y)`. 

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the operation `op` is being applied directly to arrays `x` and `y` without performing any logic or data type checks. This can lead to errors or unexpected behavior, especially when dealing with arrays of different data types or containing NaN values.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle different data types and NaN values properly by performing type and NaN checks before applying the operation.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import numpy as np

def na_logical_op(x: np.ndarray, y, op):
    if isinstance(y, np.ndarray) and y.dtype.kind in ['i', 'b']:
        if x.dtype.kind in ['i', 'b']:
            result = op(x, y)
        else:
            raise TypeError(f"Cannot perform '{op.__name__}' with a dtyped [{x.dtype}] array and dtyped [{y.dtype}] array")
    else:
        y = np.array([bool(elem) if elem is not np.nan else np.nan for elem in y.flatten()], dtype=bool).reshape(y.shape)
        if x.dtype.kind in ['O', 'i', 'b'] and np.isscalar(y):
            y = bool(y)
            result = x & y  # Assuming logical 'and' operation
        else:
            raise TypeError(f"Cannot perform '{op.__name__}' with a dtyped [{x.dtype}] array and scalar of type {type(y).__name__}")

    return result
```

This corrected function first checks if the input `y` is an array with integer or boolean data types. If so, it then checks the data type of array `x`. If the data types are compatible, the operation is applied directly. If not, it raises a `TypeError`. If `y` is not an array of integer or boolean data types, the function converts the values to boolean (taking care of NaN values) and performs the operation accordingly. If `y` is a scalar, it performs the operation with appropriate type checking and handling of NaN values.
