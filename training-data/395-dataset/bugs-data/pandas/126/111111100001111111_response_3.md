The issue occurs when calling the `append` method of a DataFrame with an empty list as the `other` parameter. The bug occurs due to the method trying to access the first item of the empty list without checking its length, which results in an IndexError.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `append` method to handle the case when `other` is an empty list. We can check the length of the `other` list and return the original DataFrame if it is empty.

Here's the corrected code for the `append` method:

```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=None):
    """
    Append rows of `other` to the end of caller, returning a new object.

    Columns in `other` that are not in the caller are added as new columns.
    
    ... (other comments remain unchanged) ...

    """
    if isinstance(other, list) and len(other) == 0:
        return self

    # rest of the method remains unchanged
```

With this modification, we first check if `other` is a list and if its length is 0. If it is, we simply return the original DataFrame `self`. Otherwise, we proceed with the current implementation of the `append` method.

This fix will prevent the IndexError from occurring when calling `append` with an empty list and ensure that the original DataFrame is returned intact in such cases.
