The error occurs because the function is checking if the 'other' input is a list and if the first element in the list is not a DataFrame. However, in the provided runtime value and type for the buggy function, '[]' is an empty list with no elements, so it's causing an index out of range error when trying to access the first element of the empty list.

To fix this issue, you should first handle the case where 'other' is an empty list and return the DataFrame without attempting to process an empty list as it should just return the original dataframe. 

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=None):
    if len(other) == 0:  # check for an empty list
        return self  # return the original dataframe if other is empty

    # existing code for handling other types of input
    # ...

    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(other, (list, tuple)):
        to_concat = [self] + other
    else:
        to_concat = [self, other]

    return concat(
        to_concat,
        ignore_index=ignore_index,
        verify_integrity=verify_integrity,
        sort=sort,
    )
```

With this correction, the function will now properly handle the case where 'other' is an empty list and return the original dataframe without attempting to access elements in the empty list, resolving the index out of range error.
