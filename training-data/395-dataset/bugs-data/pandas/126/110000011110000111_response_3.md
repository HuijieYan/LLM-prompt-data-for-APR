The test case `test_append_empty_list` calls the `append` method on an empty DataFrame and passes an empty list as an argument. The expected behavior is that the original DataFrame should be returned intact without crashing.

The error message indicates that an `IndexError` occurs at line 6946 in the `core/frame.py` file when the `other` parameter is an empty list, and the code attempts to access `other[0]` without checking if the list is empty.

The reason for the bug is that the code does not check if the `other` parameter is an empty list before attempting to access `other[0]`.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the `other` is an empty list and return the original DataFrame without performing any operations. If it is not an empty list, then we can continue with the append operation.

Here's the corrected code for the append method with the fix:

```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=None):
    if isinstance(other, list) and len(other) == 0:
        return self
    # ... rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By adding the check for an empty list and returning the original DataFrame, we ensure that the function doesn't crash when an empty list is passed as an argument.
