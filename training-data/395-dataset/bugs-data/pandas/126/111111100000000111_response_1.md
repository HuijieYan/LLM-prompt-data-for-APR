The error occurs when an empty list is passed to the DataFrame.append() method, which leads to an IndexError. This is because the code in the append() method does not handle the case when an empty list is passed as the 'other' argument.

To fix this issue, we can check if 'other' is an empty list at the beginning of the append() method and return the original DataFrame if it is empty. 

Here is the corrected code for the append() method:

```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=None):
    if isinstance(other, list) and len(other) == 0:
        return self
    """
    Append rows of `other` to the end of caller, returning a new object.
    Columns in `other` that are not in the caller are added as new columns.
    
    ... (rest of the function code remains the same)
    """
```

With the above correction, if an empty list is passed as the 'other' argument to the append() method, it will return the original DataFrame without throwing an IndexError.
