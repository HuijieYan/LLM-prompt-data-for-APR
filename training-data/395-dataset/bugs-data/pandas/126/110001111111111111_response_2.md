The error occurs because the function tries to access the first element of an empty list without checking if the list is empty or not.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to first check if the `other` list is empty before trying to access its first element.

Here's the corrected code for the `append` function:

```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=None):
    """
    Append rows of `other` to the end of caller, returning a new object.

    Columns in `other` that are not in the caller are added as new columns.

    Parameters
    ----------
    other : DataFrame or Series/dict-like object, or list of these
        The data to append.
    ignore_index : bool, default False
        If True, do not use the index labels.
    verify_integrity : bool, default False
        If True, raise ValueError on creating index with duplicates.
    sort : bool, default None
        Sort columns if the columns of `self` and `other` are not aligned.
        The default sorting is deprecated and will change to not-sorting
        in a future version of pandas. Explicitly pass ``sort=True`` to
        silence the warning and sort. Explicitly pass ``sort=False`` to
        silence the warning and not sort.

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    See Also
    --------
    concat : General function to concatenate DataFrame or Series objects.

    Notes
    -----
    If a list of dict/series is passed and the keys are all contained in
    the DataFrame's index, the order of the columns in the resulting
    DataFrame will be unchanged.

    Iteratively appending rows to a DataFrame can be more computationally
    intensive than a single concatenate. A better solution is to append
    those rows to a list and then concatenate the list with the original
    DataFrame all at once.
    """

    if len(other) == 0:  # Check if the list is empty
        return self  # Return the original DataFrame if list is empty

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By adding the conditional check for an empty list, the function will now return the original DataFrame if an empty list is passed, preventing the IndexError from occurring.
