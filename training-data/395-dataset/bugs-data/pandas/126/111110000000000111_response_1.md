The issue seems to be related to the `DataFrame.append` method crashing when an empty list is passed as an argument.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely at the following code block:
```python
elif isinstance(other, list) and not isinstance(other[0], DataFrame):
    other = DataFrame(other)
    if (self.columns.get_indexer(other.columns) >= 0).all():
        other = other.reindex(columns=self.columns)
```
Here, the function attempts to handle the case where the `other` parameter is a list and not an instance of DataFrame. It then attempts to convert the list `other` into a DataFrame and performs an operation with `self.columns`, which may result in an `IndexError` when an empty list is passed.

The reason behind the bug is that the function does not handle the case of an empty list being passed as an argument to the `append` method.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to handle the case where an empty list is passed and return the original DataFrame without attempting further operations.

The corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=None):
    """
    Append rows of `other` to the end of caller, returning a new object.

    Columns in `other` that are not in the caller are added as new columns.

    Parameters
    ----------
    other : DataFrame or Series/dict-like object, or list of these
        The data to append.
    ignore_index : bool, default False
        If True, do not use the index labels.
    verify_integrity : bool, default False
        If True, raise ValueError on creating index with duplicates.
    sort : bool, default None
        Sort columns if the columns of `self` and `other` are not aligned.
        The default sorting is deprecated and will change to not-sorting
        in a future version of pandas. Explicitly pass ``sort=True`` to
        silence the warning and sort. Explicitly pass ``sort=False`` to
        silence the warning and not sort.
    """
    if isinstance(other, list):
        if len(other) == 0:
            return self  # Return the original DataFrame if other is an empty list

    # Rest of the function code
    # ...
```
