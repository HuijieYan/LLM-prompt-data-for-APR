The test case `test_append_empty_list` aims to check if an empty list passed to the `append` method of a DataFrame results in maintaining the original DataFrame without causing any crash.

The error message indicates an IndexError occurring in the `append` method of the DataFrame class, specifically at line 6946 in the file pandas/core/frame.py. The error occurs when the method checks if `other` is a list and the first element of the list is not a DataFrame, which results in an index out of range error.

The bug occurs because the method does not handle the case of an empty list properly. When an empty list is passed to the `append` method, it tries to access the first element of the list, which does not exist, resulting in an IndexError.

To fix the bug, the `append` method should first check if `other` is an empty list and return the original DataFrame without further processing in this case.

Here's the corrected `append` method:

```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=None):
    if isinstance(other, list) and len(other) == 0:
        return self  # Return the original DataFrame if 'other' is an empty list

    # ...rest of the method remains the same...
```
