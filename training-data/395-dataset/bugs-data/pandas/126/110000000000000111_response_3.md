The error occurs in the `append` method of the DataFrame class when it receives an empty list as input. The error is raised because the method tries to access the first element of the input list without checking if the list is empty.

The potential error location within the function is the following block of code:

```python
elif isinstance(other, list) and not isinstance(other[0], DataFrame):
    other = DataFrame(other)
    if (self.columns.get_indexer(other.columns) >= 0).all():
        other = other.reindex(columns=self.columns)
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function does not handle the case when `other` is an empty list and tries to access the first element of the empty list.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to add a check for an empty list at the beginning of the method and return the original DataFrame if the list is empty.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=None):
    """
    Append rows of `other` to the end of caller, returning a new object.
    (Rest of the docstring remains the same)

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    if isinstance(other, list) and not other:
        return self
    # Rest of the method remains the same
```

With this correction, the function will check if `other` is an empty list and return the original DataFrame, preventing the IndexError from being raised when an empty list is passed to the `append` method.
