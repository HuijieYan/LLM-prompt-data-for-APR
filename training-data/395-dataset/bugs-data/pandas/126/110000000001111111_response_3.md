The bug is likely occurring in the section of the function where it checks if the input 'other' is a list and if the first element inside the list is not a DataFrame. This is supported by the bug description, which mentions an IndexError when checking the first element of 'other'.

The issue is caused because the function fails to handle an empty list input for 'other' correctly. It expects the 'other' list to have at least one element, and it tries to access the first element without checking if the list is empty.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the code to handle an empty list input for 'other' without attempting to access the first element of an empty list.

```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=None):
    """
    Append rows of `other` to the end of caller, returning a new object.
    ...
    """
    from pandas import DataFrame, concat

    if isinstance(other, list) and len(other) > 0:
        if not isinstance(other[0], DataFrame):
            other = DataFrame(other)

            if (self.columns.get_indexer(other.columns) >= 0).all():
                other = other.reindex(columns=self.columns)

    to_concat = [self, other] if isinstance(other, DataFrame) else [self] + other

    return concat(
        to_concat,
        ignore_index=ignore_index,
        verify_integrity=verify_integrity,
        sort=sort,
    )
```

In the fixed code, we first check if 'other' is a list and if it is not empty. If these conditions are met, we then check if the first element in the list is not a DataFrame. If this is also true, we convert the list into a DataFrame and reindex it if needed. Finally, we concatenate 'self' and 'other' and return the result.
