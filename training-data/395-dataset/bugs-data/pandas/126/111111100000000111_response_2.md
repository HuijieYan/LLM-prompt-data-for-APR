Potential error location: The error is occurring when an empty list is passed to the `append` method of a DataFrame. The code is trying to access the first element of the list, causing an IndexError because the list is empty.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `append` method does not handle the case where an empty list is passed as the `other` argument. It assumes that if `other` is a list, it contains at least one element, and it tries to access the first element of the list without checking if the list is empty.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Check if the `other` list is empty and return the original DataFrame if it is.
2. Add a conditional statement to handle the case where an empty list is passed as `other`.

Corrected code:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the append function
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=None):
    """
    Append rows of `other` to the end of caller, returning a new object.

    Columns in `other` that are not in the caller are added as new columns.

    Parameters
    ----------
    other : DataFrame or Series/dict-like object, or list of these
        The data to append.
    ignore_index : bool, default False
        If True, do not use the index labels.
    verify_integrity : bool, default False
        If True, raise ValueError on creating index with duplicates.
    sort : bool, default None
        Sort columns if the columns of `self` and `other` are not aligned.
        The default sorting is deprecated and will change to not-sorting
        in a future version of pandas. Explicitly pass ``sort=True`` to
        silence the warning and sort. Explicitly pass ``sort=False`` to
        silence the warning and not sort.
