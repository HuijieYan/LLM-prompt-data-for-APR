The issue occurs when the `DataFrame.append` function is called with an empty list as the `other` parameter. The function does not handle this case properly and raises an `IndexError` due to trying to access the first element of an empty list.

The error occurs because the function first checks if the `other` parameter is a list and then attempts to access its first element without checking if the list is empty. This leads to the `IndexError` when the list is empty.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case of an empty list being passed as the `other` parameter. We can add a check at the beginning of the function to return the original DataFrame if the `other` list is empty.

Here's the corrected code for the `DataFrame.append` function:

```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=None):
    if isinstance(other, list) and len(other) == 0:
        return self
    
    # ... rest of the function ...
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to return the original `DataFrame` if the `other` parameter is an empty list. This will prevent the IndexError from occurring and handle the empty list case properly.
