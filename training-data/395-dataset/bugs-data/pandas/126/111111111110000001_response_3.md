The error message indicates an `IndexError` on line 6946 of the `pandas/core/frame.py` file. This means that there is an issue with the indexing when the `append` function is trying to check if `other` is a list and not a DataFrame.

The issue seems to be that the function is not properly handling the case when `other` is an empty list. This is likely causing the function to try to access `other[0]`, resulting in the `IndexError`.

To fix this issue, we can add a check at the beginning of the `append` function to handle the case when `other` is an empty list. This check should return the original DataFrame without attempting any operations on an empty list.

Here's the corrected code for the `append` function:

```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=None):
    if isinstance(other, list) and len(other) == 0:
        return self  # Return original DataFrame if other is an empty list

    """
    Append rows of `other` to the end of caller, returning a new object.
    
    ... (rest of the function remains the same)
    """
```

With this change, the function will return the original DataFrame if `other` is an empty list, preventing any errors related to indexing an empty list.
