The error occurs in the `DataFrame.append` method when the `other` parameter is an empty list. The code tries to access the first element of the list `other[0]`, which doesn't exist because the list is empty, resulting in an IndexError.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the code to handle the case where the `other` parameter is an empty list. The function should return the original DataFrame when the list is empty, rather than trying to access the first element of the empty list.

Here's the corrected code for the `DataFrame.append` method:

```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=None):
    if not isinstance(other, (Series, dict)) and not other:
        # Return the original DataFrame when `other` is an empty list
        return self
    """
    Append rows of `other` to the end of caller, returning a new object.

    Columns in `other` that are not in the caller are added as new columns.

    Parameters
    ----------
    other : DataFrame or Series/dict-like object, or list of these
        The data to append.
    ignore_index : bool, default False
        If True, do not use the index labels.
    verify_integrity : bool, default False
        If True, raise ValueError on creating index with duplicates.
    sort : bool, default None
        Sort columns if the columns of `self` and `other` are not aligned.
        The default sorting is deprecated and will change to not-sorting
        in a future version of pandas. Explicitly pass ``sort=True`` to
        silence the warning and sort. Explicitly pass ``sort=False`` to
        silence the warning and not sort.
    ...
```

With this modification, when `other` is an empty list, the method will simply return the original DataFrame without raising an IndexError.
