The test case is attempting to append an empty list to a DataFrame and is expecting the appended result to be identical to the original DataFrame. However, this is not the behavior of the current buggy `append` function, as it raises an error when trying to handle an empty list.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `elif` condition where it checks if `other` is a list and if the first item in the list is not a DataFrame. This check is causing the IndexError when trying to access `other[0]` if `other` is an empty list.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function does not handle the case of an empty list properly and raises an IndexError when trying to access the first item in the list.

To fix this bug, we need to add a condition to handle the case when `other` is an empty list. This condition should return the original DataFrame without attempting to access `other[0]`.

Here's the corrected `append` function:

```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=None):
    """
    Append rows of `other` to the end of caller, returning a new object.

    Columns in `other` that are not in the caller are added as new columns.
    
    ... (rest of the function remains the same)

    """
    if isinstance(other, list):
        if len(other) == 0:
            return self  # Return the original DataFrame for empty list
        elif not isinstance(other[0], DataFrame):
            other = DataFrame(other)
            if (self.columns.get_indexer(other.columns) >= 0).all():
                other = other.reindex(columns=self.columns)

    # Rest of the function remains the same
``` 

In this corrected version, we added a condition to check if `other` is a list and if it's empty. If `other` is empty, the function returns the original DataFrame without attempting to access `other[0]`. If it's not empty, then the subsequent `elif` condition is executed as before.
