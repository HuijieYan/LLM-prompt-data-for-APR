The error occurs during the test because the `df.append([])` call is trying to access the first element of an empty list, which raises an IndexError.

The bug in the `append` function is caused by the fact that it doesn't handle the case when `other` is an empty list properly. It assumes that `other` is a list containing at least one element.

To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to handle the case when `other` is an empty list and return the original DataFrame without any modifications.

Here's the corrected `append` function:

```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=None):
    if isinstance(other, list) and len(other) == 0:
        return self  # return the original DataFrame when other is an empty list

    # ... rest of the function remains unchanged ...
```
