The bug occurs in the `append` function as it is trying to handle different input types such as `DataFrame`, `Series`, dictionary-like objects, or lists. The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of the input types, and the concatenation process.

In the first case, the `self` DataFrame is empty, and the `other` parameter is an empty list. The bug is likely to occur during the `concat` operation where it tries to concatenate with an empty DataFrame.

In the second case, the `self` DataFrame has some data, but the `other` parameter is an empty list. The bug is likely to occur during the `concat` operation where the empty list is concatenated with `self`.

To fix the bug, we can add conditions for handling specific input types such as:
- If `self` is empty, it should directly return `other` if `other` is not empty.
- If `other` is a list and not empty, it should directly return `other`.
- If `other` is a list of DataFrames, it should directly concatenate the list with `self`.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=None):
    if isinstance(self, DataFrame) and self.empty:
        if isinstance(other, DataFrame):
            return other
        elif isinstance(other, list) and other:
            return other
    elif isinstance(other, list) and all(isinstance(item, DataFrame) for item in other):
        from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat
        return concat([self] + other, ignore_index=ignore_index, verify_integrity=verify_integrity, sort=sort)
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid types for `self` and `other` in append operation.")
```

In this corrected function, we specifically handle the cases where `self` is empty, `other` is a list, and `other` is a list of DataFrames. This should address the bug and provide the expected behavior for the `append` function.
