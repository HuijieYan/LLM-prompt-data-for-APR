The test case `test_append_empty_list` attempts to append an empty list to a DataFrame. The expected behavior is to return a new DataFrame without modifying the original one.

The error message indicates that there is an `IndexError` because the function is attempting to access `other[0]` when `other` is an empty list.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where `other` is an empty list, resulting in an IndexError when attempting to access `other[0]`.

To fix the bug, the function should include a check for an empty list and return the original DataFrame without modification.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=None):
    if isinstance(other, list) and len(other) == 0:
        return self
    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

By checking if `other` is a list and has a length of 0, the function will return the original DataFrame when an empty list is passed as an argument.
