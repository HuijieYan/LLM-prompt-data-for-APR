The test case `test_append_empty_list` is attempting to append an empty list `[]` to a DataFrame `df`. The expected behavior is that the original DataFrame remains unchanged and a new DataFrame is returned. However, the test is currently failing with an `IndexError` due to the buggy behavior of the `append` method.

The error occurs because the function inappropriately attempts to check the existence of elements in an empty list. When `other` is an empty list and the function attempts to access `other[0]`, it results in an `IndexError` since the list is empty and has no elements.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be modified to handle the case of an empty list appropriately, ensuring that it doesn't attempt to access elements that do not exist.

Here's the corrected code for the `append` method:

```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=None):
    if not isinstance(other, list) or len(other) == 0:
        # If other is not a list or is an empty list, create a new DataFrame with the original data
        return DataFrame(self)

    # Rest of the function logic remains unchanged
    # ...
```
