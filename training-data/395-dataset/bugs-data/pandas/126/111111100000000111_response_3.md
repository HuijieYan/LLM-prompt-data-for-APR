The error occurs when an empty list is passed to the append function of the DataFrame. The function is expecting the "other" argument to be a DataFrame or Series/dict-like object, or a list of these. When an empty list is passed, the function tries to access the first element of the list using `other[0]`, which results in an IndexError since there are no elements in an empty list.

The bug can be fixed by adding a check for an empty list at the beginning of the append function. If an empty list is detected, the function can simply return the original DataFrame without attempting to perform any operations on an empty list.

Here's the corrected code for the append function:

```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=None):
    if isinstance(other, list) and len(other) == 0:
        return self  # return original DataFrame if other is an empty list
    # rest of the function's code
```
