The buggy function `append` is designed to append rows of `other` to the end of the caller DataFrame, returning a new object. The bug occurs when the input `other` is an empty list. It seems that the function is not properly handling the case when `other` is an empty list.

Upon analyzing the test cases, it seems that the function is not correctly handling the scenario where the input `other` is an empty list. This leads to unexpected behavior when the function is called with an empty list.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to check for the case where `other` is an empty list and handle it appropriately. We can simply return the caller DataFrame without performing any concatenation or reindexing when `other` is an empty list.

Here's the corrected code for the `append` function:

```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=None):
    if not other:  # Check if other is an empty list
        return self  # Return the caller DataFrame as it is
    
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```
