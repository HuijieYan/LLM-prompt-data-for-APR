The test case `test_append_empty_list` tries to call the `append` function on an empty DataFrame.

The error occurs on the line `elif isinstance(other, list) and not isinstance(other[0], DataFrame):` where it checks if the variable `other` is a list and if its first element is not a DataFrame. In the case of an empty list, accessing the first element causes the `IndexError: list index out of range` error.

The bug occurs because the function is expecting `other` to be a list with at least one DataFrame in it. However, in the given test case and some other scenarios, `other` can be an empty list.

To fix the bug, we can add a check for an empty list and return the original DataFrame in such cases. Below is the corrected code for the `append` function:

```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=None):
    if isinstance(other, list):
        if len(other) == 0:  # If other is an empty list, return the original DataFrame
            return self
        elif not isinstance(other[0], DataFrame):
            raise TypeError("other must be a DataFrame or list of DataFrames")

    # rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...
```

With this fix, when the `append` function is called with an empty list, it will return the original DataFrame without trying to access the first element of the list. This should resolve the IndexError issue.
