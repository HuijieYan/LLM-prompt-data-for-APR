The error occurs when the `append` method is called with an empty list as `other`. The function is attempting to access `other[0]` even when the list is empty, resulting in an `IndexError`.

To fix this, the function should check if the `other` list is empty before attempting to access `other[0]`. If the list is empty, it should return the original DataFrame without any modifications.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=None):
    """
    Append rows of `other` to the end of caller, returning a new object.

    Columns in `other` that are not in the caller are added as new columns.

    Parameters
    ----------
    other : DataFrame or Series/dict-like object, or list of these
        The data to append.
    ignore_index : bool, default False
        If True, do not use the index labels.
    verify_integrity : bool, default False
        If True, raise ValueError on creating index with duplicates.
    sort : bool, default None
        Sort columns if the columns of `self` and `other` are not aligned.
        The default sorting is deprecated and will change to not-sorting
        in a future version of pandas. Explicitly pass ``sort=True`` to
        silence the warning and sort. Explicitly pass ``sort=False`` to
        silence the warning and not sort.

    """
    if not isinstance(other, (list, tuple)):
        # Return self if the `other` is not a list or tuple
        return self

    if not other:
        # Return self if the `other` list is empty
        return self

    # rest of the code remains the same as in the original function
    # ...
```

By adding a conditional check to return the original DataFrame if `other` is not a list or tuple or if it's an empty list, we can avoid the IndexError that occurs when trying to access `other[0]`.
