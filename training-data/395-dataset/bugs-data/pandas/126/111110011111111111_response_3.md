The bug is caused by the conditional statement `if isinstance(other, list) and not isinstance(other[0], DataFrame):` in the `append` function. When the `other` parameter is an empty list, the conditional statement checks if the first element of the list is an instance of DataFrame, which causes an IndexError since the list is empty.

The bug occurs because the conditional statement assumes that `other` is not empty before checking its first element, which causes the IndexError.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statement to first check if `other` is not empty before attempting to access its first element.

Here's the corrected version of the `append` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=None):
    if isinstance(other, list):
        if len(other) > 0 and isinstance(other[0], DataFrame):
            # existing implementation
            pass
        else:
            # create a new DataFrame from other and append it to self
            other_df = DataFrame(other)
            result = concat([self, other_df], ignore_index=ignore_index, verify_integrity=verify_integrity, sort=sort)
            return result
    else:
        # existing implementation
        pass
```

With this corrected function, the conditional statement first checks if `other` is a non-empty list and then verifies if its first element is an instance of DataFrame. If the conditions are met, the existing implementation continues; otherwise, a new DataFrame is created from `other` and appended to `self`, and the result is returned.

This fix addresses the IndexError that occurred when an empty list was passed to the `append` function, ensuring that the function returns a new object without crashing.
