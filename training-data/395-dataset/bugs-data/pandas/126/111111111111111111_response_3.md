The error occurs in the `append` method of the `DataFrame` class. When an empty list is passed as the `other` parameter, the code attempts to access the first element of the list (`other[0]`) without checking if the list is empty. This causes an IndexError because the list is empty.

To fix this issue, the code should first check if the `other` list is empty. If it is, the method should return the original DataFrame without trying to process the empty list.

Here's the corrected code for the `append` method:

```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=None):
    """
    Append rows of `other` to the end of caller, returning a new object.

    Columns in `other` that are not in the caller are added as new columns.

    Parameters
    ----------
    other : DataFrame or Series/dict-like object, or list of these
        The data to append.
    ignore_index : bool, default False
        If True, do not use the index labels.
    verify_integrity : bool, default False
        If True, raise ValueError on creating index with duplicates.
    sort : bool, default None
        Sort columns if the columns of `self` and `other` are not aligned.
        The default sorting is deprecated and will change to not-sorting
        in a future version of pandas. Explicitly pass ``sort=True`` to
        silence the warning and sort. Explicitly pass ``sort=False`` to
        silence the warning and not sort.

        .. versionadded:: 0.23.0

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    if not isinstance(other, (list, tuple)):
        other = [other]

    if len(other) == 0:
        return self

    # rest of the method's code remains unchanged
```

With this correction, the method first checks if the `other` parameter is a list or a tuple. If it is, and it is empty, the method simply returns the original DataFrame without attempting any further operations. This prevents the IndexError that occurred previously when an empty list was passed to the `append` method.
