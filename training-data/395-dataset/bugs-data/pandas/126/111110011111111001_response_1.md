The error occurs in the `elif` block when checking if `other` is a list and the first element is not a DataFrame. This error is due to the code trying to access `other[0]` without first checking if the list `other` is empty.

To fix this bug, we need to add a conditional check to handle the case when `other` is an empty list. We will return the original DataFrame without any changes if `other` is empty.

Here's the corrected code for the `append` function:

```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=None):
        if not isinstance(other, (DataFrame, Series, dict, list)):
            raise TypeError("other must be a DataFrame, Series/dict-like object, or list of these")
        
        if isinstance(other, list):
            if len(other) == 0:
                return self
        
        # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By adding the conditional check for an empty list, we ensure that the code won't try to access `other[0]` when `other` is empty, hence preventing the "list index out of range" error.
