Potential error location: The potential error in the function is in the section where it tries to convert 'other' to a DataFrame.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the function does not handle the cases when 'other' is a Series or a dictionary properly. It also does not handle the cases when 'other' is a list of non-DataFrame objects correctly.

Suggested approaches for fixing the bug: The function should handle cases when 'other' is a Series or a dictionary separately to ensure proper conversion to a DataFrame. Additionally, it should handle the cases when 'other' is a list of non-DataFrame objects correctly.

Corrected code:

```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=None):
    """
    Append rows of `other` to the end of caller, returning a new object.

    Columns in `other` that are not in the caller are added as new columns.

    Parameters
    ----------
    other : DataFrame or Series/dict-like object, or list of these
        The data to append.
    ignore_index : bool, default False
        If True, do not use the index labels.
    verify_integrity : bool, default False
        If True, raise ValueError on creating index with duplicates.
    sort : bool, default None
        Sort columns if the columns of `self` and `other` are not aligned.
        The default sorting is deprecated and will change to not-sorting
        in a future version of pandas. Explicitly pass ``sort=True`` to
        silence the warning and sort. Explicitly pass ``sort=False`` to
        silence the warning and not sort.

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame

    See Also
    --------
    concat : General function to concatenate DataFrame or Series objects.

    Notes
    -----
    If a list of dict/series is passed and the keys are all contained in
    the DataFrame's index, the order of the columns in the resulting
    DataFrame will be unchanged.

    Iteratively appending rows to a DataFrame can be more computationally
    intensive than a single concatenate. A better solution is to append
    those rows to a list and then concatenate the list with the original
    DataFrame all at once.
