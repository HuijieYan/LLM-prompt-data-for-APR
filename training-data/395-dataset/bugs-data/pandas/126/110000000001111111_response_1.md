The error occurs in the `append()` function of the DataFrame class when an empty list is passed as the `other` parameter. The code attempts to access the first element of the list `other` without checking if it's empty, which results in an IndexError.

To fix the bug, the code needs to first check if the `other` parameter is an empty list, and if so, return the DataFrame `self` without attempting any further operations.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=None):
    """
    Append rows of `other` to the end of caller, returning a new object.

    Columns in `other` that are not in the caller are added as new columns.

    Parameters
    ----------
    other : DataFrame or Series/dict-like object, or list of these
        The data to append.
    ignore_index : bool, default False
        If True, do not use the index labels.
    verify_integrity : bool, default False
        If True, raise ValueError on creating index with duplicates.
    sort : bool, default None
        Sort columns if the columns of `self` and `other` are not aligned.
        The default sorting is deprecated and will change to not-sorting
        in a future version of pandas. Explicitly pass ``sort=True`` to
        silence the warning and sort. Explicitly pass ``sort=False`` to
        silence the warning and not sort.

    """

    if isinstance(other, list) and len(other) == 0:
        return self

    # ... rest of the code remains unchanged ...
```

With this modification, the function will first check if `other` is an empty list and return the DataFrame `self` immediately, preventing the IndexError from occurring.
