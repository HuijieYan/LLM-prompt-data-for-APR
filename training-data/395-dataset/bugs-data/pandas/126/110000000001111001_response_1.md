The bug is likely located in the section of the function where the `other` parameter is being processed. The function is trying to handle various scenarios based on the type of `other` (i.e., whether it's a DataFrame, Series, dict-like object, or list), and based on this type, different operations are performed. 

In the provided test cases, the type of `other` is a list. When `other` is an empty list, the function should handle this case differently compared to when `other` is a non-empty list containing DataFrame or Series objects.

The bug occurs because when `other` is an empty list, the function still tries to perform operations based on the assumption that it contains DataFrame or Series objects. This causes errors such as "AttributeError: 'list' object has no attribute 'name'" or other related errors.

To fix the bug, the function should include an explicit check for whether `other` is an empty list, and if so, handle this case separately, returning the original DataFrame without trying to perform operations based on the assumption that `other` contains DataFrame or Series objects.

Below is the corrected code for the `append` function:

```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=None):
    if not other:  # Check if other is an empty list
        if ignore_index:
            return self.append(pd.DataFrame(columns=self.columns))
        else:
            return self.append(pd.DataFrame(columns=self.columns), ignore_index=True)

    from pandas.core.reshape.concat import concat

    if isinstance(other, (list, tuple)):
        to_concat = [self] + other
    else:
        to_concat = [self, other]
    return concat(
        to_concat,
        ignore_index=ignore_index,
        verify_integrity=verify_integrity,
        sort=sort,
    )
```

In the corrected code:
1. The function first checks if `other` is an empty list.
2. If `other` is an empty list, it returns the original DataFrame with or without index based on the value of `ignore_index`.
3. If `other` is a non-empty list, it proceeds with the concatenation process as before.

This approach ensures that the function handles the case of an empty list appropriately and avoids performing operations that are meant for DataFrame or Series objects on an empty list.
