The error occurs when the function tries to access `other[0]` when checking if `other` is a list and the first element is not a DataFrame. The problem is that when `other` is an empty list, trying to access `other[0]` causes an IndexError.

To fix this issue, we can modify the logic to first check if `other` is an empty list, and if so, return the DataFrame `self` as there is nothing to append.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def append(self, other, ignore_index=False, verify_integrity=False, sort=None):
    if isinstance(other, list):
        if len(other) == 0:
            return self
        elif not isinstance(other[0], (DataFrame, Series, dict)):
            raise TypeError("cannot concatenate object of type '{0}'".format(type(other).__name__))
    
    # rest of the function remains as is
    ...
```
