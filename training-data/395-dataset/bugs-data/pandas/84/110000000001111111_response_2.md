The error occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function when trying to handle a multi-index with tuple names. The bug occurs when trying to get the level number of the index, where the tuple names are not handled correctly, leading to a KeyError.

To fix this bug, the function needs to handle the tuple names correctly and extract the level number for each tuple in the clocs list.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i[0]) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle the tuple names when getting the level number, fixing the KeyError issue for unstacking multi-index with tuple names.
