The error is likely originated from the `_unstack_multiple` function, due to its implementation for handling hierarchical columns. When the function receives the input parameters `clocs=('A', 'a')` and `fill_value=None`, and `data` as the provided DataFrame, the function runs into issues and returns incorrect values for `unstacked` and `new_columns`.

The function fails to appropriately handle the MultiIndex columns when it should instead unstack the provided DataFrame. The function attempts to create a new MultiIndex and a dummy DataFrame to perform the unstacking operation, but its current implementation leads to erroneous results.

To fix the bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function should be updated to properly handle the unstacking process for a DataFrame with hierarchical columns. This can be achieved by directly calling the `unstack()` method on the DataFrame `data`.

Below is the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    # Unstack the DataFrame data based on the clocs value
    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    
    return unstacked
```
