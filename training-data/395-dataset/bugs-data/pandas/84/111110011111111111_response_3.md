The error occurs in the `_get_level_number` method of the MultiIndex class. When trying to unstack a MultiIndex with tuple names, the function fails to correctly handle the tuple and raises a KeyError.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not designed to handle tuple names properly. The input `level` in the `_get_level_number` method should be processed differently when it's a tuple.

To fix the bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function should be updated to handle tuple names correctly. This should involve modifying the way the function deals with the `clocs` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Check if the level is a tuple, and handle it appropriately
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        cloc_numbers = [index._get_level_number(level) for level in clocs]
    else:
        cloc_numbers = [index._get_level_number(clocs)]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...

    # Use cloc_numbers instead of clocs further in the function

    return unstacked
```

The changes made to the function involve handling the tuple input for `clocs`. If it's a tuple, the `index._get_level_number` method is used for each element of the tuple, and the resulting level numbers are used in the subsequent steps of the function.

These changes should resolve the issue with unstacking a MultiIndex with tuple names and avoid the KeyError that was previously occurring.
