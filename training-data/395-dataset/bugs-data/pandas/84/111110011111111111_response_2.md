The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is failing due to an error in handling tuple names in a MultiIndex when unstacking. The function tries to get the level number for a given level, but it incorrectly handles tuples as level names.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the function `_get_level_number` doesn't handle tuple names correctly when trying to get the level number.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle tuple names as level names in a MultiIndex when getting the level number. It should also handle a tuple of level names passed to the `unstack` method in a MultiIndex. The function should also consider the possibility of a tuple of level names instead of a single level name.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Rest of the code remains the same

    # Replace the following line
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    # with

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(clocs)]

    # Rest of the code remains the same
```

With this correction, the `_unstack_multiple` function will correctly handle tuple names as level names in a MultiIndex when getting the level number and will also handle a tuple of level names instead of a single level name.

Following this correction, the test case `test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex` should pass without raising the `KeyError` that was previously observed.
