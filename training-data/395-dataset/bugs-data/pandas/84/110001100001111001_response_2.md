The bug in the provided function `_unstack_multiple` is due to the mishandling of the `clocs` variable, which is not correctly being processed to determine the columns to be unstacked. The function seems to be intended to unstack a DataFrame in multiple columns, but it is not handling the input `clocs` properly. 

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `clocs` input is correctly converted to the expected list format and used to select the appropriate columns to unstack.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = list(clocs)
    
    clevel_numbers = [index._get_level_number(cloc) for cloc in clocs]
    rlevel_numbers = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clevel_numbers]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clevel_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clevel_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clevel_numbers]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlevel_numbers]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlevel_numbers]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlevel_numbers]

    # Remaining code for unstacking...
```

In the corrected code:
- We check if `clocs` is a tuple and convert it to a list if necessary.
- The `clocs` list is used to extract level numbers and then select the corresponding levels, codes, and names accordingly for further unstacking process.
