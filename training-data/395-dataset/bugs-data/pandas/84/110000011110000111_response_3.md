The error occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function at the line where it tries to get the level number using `index._get_level_number(i)`. The error message indicates that there is an issue with the level name 'A' not being found.

The bug occurs because the function is expecting level names in a tuple format, but the `index._get_level_number(i)` method does not handle tuple names correctly, resulting in the KeyError for level 'A'.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the code in `_unstack_multiple` to handle tuple names correctly and extract the level numbers from them.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    level_numbers = []
    for cloc in clocs:
        if isinstance(cloc, tuple):
            level_number = tuple(index._get_level_number(name) for name in cloc)
        else:
            level_number = index._get_level_number(cloc)
        level_numbers.append(level_number)

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in level_numbers]

    # Other parts of the function remain the same
    # ...

    return unstacked
```

In this corrected code, we iterate through the `clocs` and check if the element is a tuple. If it is a tuple, we extract the level numbers for each name in the tuple using `index._get_level_number(name)`. Otherwise, we use `index._get_level_number(cloc)` to get the level number for a single name. This allows the function to handle both single-level names and tuple names correctly, fixing the KeyError issue.
