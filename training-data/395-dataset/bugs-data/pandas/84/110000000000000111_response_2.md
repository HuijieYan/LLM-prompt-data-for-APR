The problem is due to the `_unstack_multiple` function not properly handling MultiIndex with tuple names.

The issue arises at line 4 where the function attempts to get the level number by calling `index._get_level_number(i)` with a tuple name, which results in the error.

To fix this issue, the function needs to be modified to handle MultiIndex with tuple names correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Convert tuple names to a list of level numbers
    if isinstance(index, MultiIndex):
        levels = index.names
        clocs = [levels.index(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
  
  # ... rest of the function remains as it is
```

This revised code should properly handle MultiIndex with tuple names and resolve the KeyError issue.
