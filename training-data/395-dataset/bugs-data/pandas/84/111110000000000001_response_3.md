The potential error in the code is in the section where the function checks if `data` is a Series or a DataFrame. The code tries to handle both Series and DataFrame separately but contains some errors in the logic.

The reason behind the bug is that the function is not properly handling the case when `data` is a DataFrame with a MultiIndex. It also has some issues with handling the re-construction of codes and levels.

One approach to fixing the bug is to review the logic for handling both Series and DataFrame separately and ensure that it properly handles the re-construction of indexes and columns for both cases.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, fill_value=fill_value, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = pd.Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = pd.MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, pd.Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        result = data
        for i in range(len(clocs)):
            val = clocs[i]
            result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
            clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

        unstacked = result

        if isinstance(unstacked, pd.Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = pd.MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, pd.Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
