Potential error location:
The error occurs in the `_get_level_number` function of the MultiIndex class, specifically in the line `level = self.names.index(level)`. This line tries to find the index of the specified level within the `names` attribute of the MultiIndex, and if it's not found, it raises a `KeyError`.

Reasons behind the bug:
The bug occurs because the `level` parameter passed to the `unstack` function is a tuple `("A", "a")`, and this tuple is being directly passed to the internal `_unstack_multiple` function. The function tries to treat the entire tuple as a single level, leading to the KeyError in `_get_level_number`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, the `level` parameter should be processed before being passed to the `_unstack_multiple` function. If the input is a tuple, it should be unpacked into separate levels, and then these levels should be used within the unstacking logic.

Corrected code:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):  # Check if clocs is a tuple
        cloc_numbers = [index._get_level_number(c) for c in clocs]  # Get level numbers for each element in the tuple
    else:
        cloc_numbers = [index._get_level_number(clocs)]  # Treat clocs as a single level

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    # ... (the rest of the function remains unchanged)
```
