The error occurs because the function `_get_level_number` is trying to find the index of a level in the MultiIndex but it's not finding it. The error is due to the fact that the level is a tuple ('A', 'a') and the function is expecting just a single level name.

To fix this bug, the `_get_level_number` function needs to be updated to handle MultiIndex with tuples as level names. It should handle the case where the level is a tuple. Additionally, the code that calls this function must be updated to handle the tuple level names.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    if isinstance(index, MultiIndex):
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, tuple) else index.names.index(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    
    # ... rest of the code remains the same
```

By adding the `isinstance` check for `MultiIndex` and checking if `i` is a tuple, we address the issue of the level name being a tuple. This should fix the bug and allow the function to handle both single level names and tuple level names correctly.
