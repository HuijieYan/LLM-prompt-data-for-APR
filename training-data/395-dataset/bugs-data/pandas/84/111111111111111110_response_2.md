The issue seems to be related to the `unstack` method of the `DataFrame` class where there was an attempt to unstack a MultiIndex with naming tuples.

Let's correct the issue and test it.

Based on the detailed issue description, let's go ahead and fix the `def _unstack_multiple` method. Here's the corrected function

```python
# file name: /Volumes/JerrySSD/bgp_envs/repos/pandas_84/pandas/core/reshape/reshape.py

def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    index = data.index
        
    try:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    except ValueError:
        if not isinstance(clocs[0], int):
            result_loc = []
            for multiindex in clocs:
                try:
                    result_loc.append(index._get_level_number(multiindex))
                except ValueError:
                    raise KeyError(f'Not found {multiindex}')
            clocs = result_loc

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # other parts of the function remain unchanged
```

Make sure that this new function satisfies the requirements of all affected test cases, especially the ones you have run before. After making this change, you should be able to re-run the original test functions to verify that this change has fixed the issue.
