The error in the `unstack` function occurs because the tuple names in the MultiIndex are not handled correctly. The `clocs` list is not getting the correct level number for these tuple names.

To fix this issue:
- We need to ensure that the tuple names are correctly handled when retrieving the level numbers from the MultiIndex.
- The `index._get_level_number` function should handle tuple names correctly and return the appropriate level number for the tuple.
- This will allow the unstack operation to proceed without KeyError or ValueError.

Here's the corrected `unstack` function with the fix:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    # Handle tuple names in the index to get level numbers
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ... (omitted for brevity)

    return unstacked
```

With this correction, the `unstack` function will handle tuple names in the MultiIndex correctly, and the unstack operation should work as expected without errors.
