The error occurs in the `_unstack_multiple` function, particularly in the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`. The `_get_level_number` method seems to be causing the error, as it is not handling the case where the index level name is provided as a tuple.

The bug occurs because the `_get_level_number` method assumes that `level` is a string and tries to find it in `self.names`. When the level is provided as a tuple, it fails to find it in the list of names, resulting in a KeyError.

A possible approach to fixing this bug is to modify the `_get_level_number` method to handle both cases: when the `level` is a string and when it's a tuple. If it's a tuple, we need to iterate through the tuple to find the corresponding level numbers.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clevel_numbers = []
    for cloc in clocs:
        if isinstance(cloc, str):
            clevel_numbers.append(index._get_level_number(cloc))
        else:
            for sub_cloc in cloc:
                clevel_numbers.append(index._get_level_number(sub_cloc))

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clevel_numbers]

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
    # ...
```

With this modification, the `_unstack_multiple` function should be able to properly handle tuple names in the MultiIndex and avoid the KeyError that was occurring before.
