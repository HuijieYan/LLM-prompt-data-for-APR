The issue occurs because the `_get_level_number` method is expecting a level name as a string, but it's being passed a tuple of names. This causes a KeyError because it can't find the tuple as a level.

To fix the bug, the `_get_level_number` method should handle tuples of names by first converting them to a list of level numbers.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Convert tuple of names to list of level numbers
    index = data.index
    if isinstance(clocs, tuple):
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in list(clocs)]
    else:
        clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

This change will allow the function to handle tuples of names correctly and avoid the KeyError that was occurring.
