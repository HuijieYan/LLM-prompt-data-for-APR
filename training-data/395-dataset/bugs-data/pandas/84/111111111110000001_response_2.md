The error message is indicating that the 'A' is not found in the MultiIndex names. This error is caused because the function is trying to access the level number by directly using the name. However, the names in the MultiIndex are tuples, and they cannot be directly used to access the level number.

To fix this bug, modify the `_unstack_multiple` function to properly handle the MultiIndex with tuple names. Use the correct approach to get the level number from the names of the MultiIndex.

Here's the corrected `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    cloc_numbers = []
    for cloc in clocs:
        level_names = index.names
        for i in range(len(level_names)):
            if level_names[i] == cloc:
                cloc_numbers.append(i)
                break

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in cloc_numbers]

    # rest of the code remains the same
    # ...
```

In the corrected function, we iterate through the `clocs` and find the numerical index of each level in the MultiIndex `index.names`. These numerical indices are then used in place of `clocs` to calculate the unstacking operation.

This modification will ensure that the correct level numbers are used for unstacking the MultiIndex, and it should resolve the KeyError and ValueError issues observed in the test cases.
