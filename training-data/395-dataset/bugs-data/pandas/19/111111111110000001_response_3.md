The error is occurring due to an issue in the `_getitem_axis` method. The `df.loc[key]` operation is not raising a `KeyError` as expected in the test case, indicating that the key is not being handled correctly in the `_getitem_axis` method.

The reason behind the bug is that the key is not being processed properly, leading to incorrect handling of the key that should result in a `KeyError`.

To fix the bug, the key should be handled appropriately based on its type and content to ensure that it matches the expected behavior when performing the `df.loc[key]` operation.

Here's the corrected `_getitem_axis` method:

```python
def _getitem_axis(self, key, axis: int):
    # Handle the key appropriately based on its type
    labels = self.obj._get_axis(axis)
    
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        self._validate_key(key, axis)
        return self._get_slice_axis(key, axis=axis)
    elif com.is_bool_indexer(key):
        return self._getbool_axis(key, axis=axis)
    elif is_list_like_indexer(key):
        if is_nested_tuple(key, labels):
            locs = labels.get_locs(key)
            indexer = [slice(None)] * self.ndim
            indexer[axis] = locs
            return self.obj.iloc[tuple(indexer)]

    # If key is not a slice, boolean indexer, or list-like indexer with nested tuples
    # fall back to straight lookup
    self._validate_key(key, axis)
    return self._get_label(key, axis=axis)
```

With the corrected implementation, the issues in handling the key in the `_getitem_axis` method should be resolved, and the `df.loc[key]` operations should raise a `KeyError` appropriately when necessary.
