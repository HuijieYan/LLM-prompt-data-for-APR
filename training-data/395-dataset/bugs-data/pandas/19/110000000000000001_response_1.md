Potential error location: 

The potential error location in the code is in the logic for handling the key if it is an iterator, list-like indexer, or slice. It appears that the logic for handling these different types of keys is convoluted and may not cover all cases properly, leading to potential bugs or unexpected behavior.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: 

The bug may occur due to the complex logic for handling different types of keys, which can lead to improper handling of the keys and incorrect results.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 

1. Simplify the logic for handling different types of keys to make it more straightforward and easier to understand.
2. Add explicit checks for different types of keys to ensure that each type is handled properly.
3. Refactor the code to separate the handling of different key types into distinct functions to improve readability and maintainability.

Corrected code:

```python
def _getitem_axis(self, key, axis: int):
    if isinstance(key, (slice, list, tuple)):
        labels = self.obj._get_axis(axis)
        if isinstance(key, slice):
            self._validate_key(key, axis)
            return self._get_slice_axis(key, axis=axis)
        elif com.is_bool_indexer(key):
            return self._getbool_axis(key, axis=axis)
        elif isinstance(labels, ABCMultiIndex):
            if isinstance(key, (ABCSeries, np.ndarray)) and key.ndim <= 1:
                key = list(key)
                return self._getitem_iterable(key, axis=axis)
            else:
                raise NotImplementedError("Indexing a MultiIndex with this key type is not implemented")
        else:
            self._validate_key(key, axis)
            return self._get_label(key, axis=axis)
    else:
        raise ValueError("Unsupported key type")
