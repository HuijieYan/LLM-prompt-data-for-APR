The error in the function `_getitem_axis` is that it attempts to get an item from a Series or DataFrame using a key that is not present in the index, leading to a `KeyError`. The error occurs when the function tries to access an item that is not in the index of the Series or DataFrame.

To fix this, the code should check if the key exists in the index before attempting to access it. If it doesn't exist, an appropriate error should be raised.

Here's the corrected code for the `_getitem_axis` function:

```python
def _getitem_axis(self, key, axis: int):
    key = item_from_zerodim(key)
    if is_iterator(key):
        key = list(key)

    labels = self.obj._get_axis(axis)
    key = labels._get_partial_string_timestamp_match_key(key)

    if isinstance(key, slice):
        self._validate_key(key, axis)
        return self._get_slice_axis(key, axis=axis)
    elif com.is_bool_indexer(key):
        return self._getbool_axis(key, axis=axis)
    elif is_list_like_indexer(key):
        # Check if key is in index
        if key not in labels:
            raise KeyError(f"{key} not in index")

        # Rest of the code to retrieve the item
        # ...
    else:
        # fall thru to straight lookup
        self._validate_key(key, axis)
        return self._get_label(key, axis=axis)
```

In the corrected code, we've added a check to see if the `key` exists in the index. If it doesn't, we raise a `KeyError` with the appropriate message. If it does exist, the code will proceed with the rest of the logic to retrieve the item.

With this correction, the function will no longer attempt to access keys that are not present in the index, preventing the `KeyError` from occurring.
