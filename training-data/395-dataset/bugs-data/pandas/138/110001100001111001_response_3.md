Potential error location: The if-elif-else structure is meant to handle different data types like datetime, timedelta, and others, but it is not correctly converting the data to the desired type.

Reason behind the bug: The function `_coerce_to_type` is not correctly converting the data to a numeric type so that the `cut` method can handle it, as mentioned in the function's docstring.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We can use the `pd.to_numeric` method to convert the input data to numeric type, which will be compatible with the `cut` method.

```python
import pandas as pd

def _coerce_to_type(x):
    """
    if the passed data is of datetime/timedelta type,
    this method converts it to numeric so that cut method can
    handle it
    """
    return pd.to_numeric(x, errors='coerce')

# Test cases
# Please note that in the corrected code, the input type and values don't need to change. Only the function needs to be corrected, so the expected value and type remain the same.

# Expected case 1
# Input parameter value and type
# x, value: 0     0
# 1     1
# 2     1
# 3     0
# 4     1
# 5     0
# 6     1
# ...
```
