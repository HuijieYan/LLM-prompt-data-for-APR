The issue with the given function is that it references methods such as `is_datetime64tz_dtype`, `is_datetime64_dtype`, `is_timedelta64_dtype`, `to_datetime`, and `to_timedelta`. These methods are not defined in the provided code and seem to be part of another library (possibly pandas/numpy). Hence, the function will raise errors when these methods are called. 

To fix this issue, we can use the hasattr() function to check for the existence of these methods before using them. If the methods exist, we can then call them, and if not, we can handle the data differently.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import datetime

def _coerce_to_type(x):
    """
    if the passed data is of datetime/timedelta type,
    this method converts it to numeric so that cut method can
    handle it
    """
    dtype = None

    if hasattr(pd, 'is_datetime64tz_dtype') and pd.is_datetime64tz_dtype(x):
        dtype = x.dtype
    elif hasattr(pd, 'is_datetime64_dtype') and pd.is_datetime64_dtype(x):
        x = pd.to_datetime(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("datetime64[ns]")
    elif hasattr(pd, 'is_timedelta64_dtype') and pd.is_timedelta64_dtype(x):
        x = pd.to_timedelta(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("timedelta64[ns]")

    if dtype is not None:
        # GH 19768: force NaT to NaN during integer conversion
        x = np.where(pd.notna(x), x.view(np.int64), np.nan)

    return x, dtype
```

In this corrected code, we first check if the methods exist in the `pandas` library before using them. If they exist, we proceed with the logic, and if they don't, we can handle the data differently to prevent errors.
