```python
import numpy as np

def _coerce_to_type(x):
    """
    if the passed data is of datetime/timedelta type,
    this method converts it to numeric so that cut method can
    handle it
    """
    dtype = None

    if isinstance(x, pd.Series) and x.dtype == 'int64':
        dtype = x.dtype
    elif isinstance(x, pd.Series) and x.dtype == 'bool':
        x = x.astype('int64')
        dtype = np.dtype("int64")

    if dtype is not None:
        x = np.where(x.notna(), x, np.nan)

    return x, dtype
```
In the original code, the function `_coerce_to_type` is intended to handle different types of input data, converting them to numeric so that the `cut` method can handle it. The bug is that the original function does not handle the input correctly for boolean data, resulting in the TypeError.

To fix the bug, the function should first check if the input is a pandas Series, and then check the dtype of the Series. If the dtype is 'int64', it should just return the input as is. If the dtype is 'bool', it should convert the data to 'int64' using the `astype` method. Finally, the function should use `np.where` to replace NaN values.
