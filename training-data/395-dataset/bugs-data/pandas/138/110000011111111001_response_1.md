The bug in the provided function `_coerce_to_type` is due to the improper handling of boolean values in the `x` input. When a boolean array is passed, the function tries to perform arithmetic operations on boolean values which is not supported in numpy. This leads to a `TypeError` and causes the function to fail.

To fix this issue, the function should explicitly handle boolean values separately from other data types and convert them to the appropriate numeric type (int, float, etc.) before performing any arithmetic operations.

Here's the corrected code for the `_coerce_to_type` function:

```python
def _coerce_to_type(x):
    """
    If the passed data is of datetime/timedelta type,
    this method converts it to numeric so that cut method can
    handle it.
    """
    dtype = None

    if is_datetime64tz_dtype(x):
        dtype = x.dtype
    elif is_datetime64_dtype(x):
        x = to_datetime(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("datetime64[ns]")
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(x):
        x = to_timedelta(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("timedelta64[ns]")
    elif is_bool_dtype(x):  # Handle boolean data type separately
        # Convert boolean to integer (0 for False, 1 for True)
        x = x.astype(np.int64)
        dtype = np.dtype("int64")

    if dtype is not None:
        # GH 19768: force NaT to NaN during integer conversion
        x = np.where(x.notna(), x.view(np.int64), np.nan)

    return x, dtype
```

In the corrected code, we've added a check for boolean types and converted the boolean array to an integer array before processing further. This modification should prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring in the original code.
