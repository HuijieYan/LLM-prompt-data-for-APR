The error occurs in the function `qcut` within the file `/Volumes/JerrySSD/bgp_envs/repos/pandas_138/pandas/core/reshape/tile.py`. The error is due to the incorrect handling of boolean values when calling the `qcut` function.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is the incorrect type conversion of boolean values to int values. The use of boolean operations such as subtraction is not supported during the conversion, resulting in a TypeError.

To fix the bug, the `_coerce_to_type` function needs to correctly handle boolean values by converting them to int values without using unsupported boolean operations.

Here's the corrected code for the `_coerce_to_type` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _coerce_to_type(x):
    if isinstance(x, pd.Series) and x.dtype == 'bool':
        x = x.astype(int)
        dtype = int
    else:
        dtype = x.dtype

    return x, dtype
```

In this corrected code, we check if the input `x` is a pandas Series with a boolean dtype. If it is, we convert the boolean values to integers using the `astype` method, and then return the converted values along with the dtype as `int`. If `x` is not a boolean Series, we simply return the original `dtype` without any conversion.
