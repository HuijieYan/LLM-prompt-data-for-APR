The error is likely occurring due to the data type coercion function `_coerce_to_type` not working correctly for boolean data. The function is designed to handle datetime/timedelta types, but when boolean data is passed, it fails to handle it.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function `_coerce_to_type` is not equipped to handle boolean data and tries to perform operations with boolean values which results in a TypeError.

To fix the bug, the `_coerce_to_type` function needs to be updated to handle boolean data properly. It should check for boolean data type and perform the necessary type conversion or handling for boolean values.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _coerce_to_type(x):
    """
    If the passed data is of datetime/timedelta type or boolean type,
    this method converts it to a numeric type so that the cut method can handle it
    """
    dtype = None

    if pd.api.types.is_datetime64tz_dtype(x):
        dtype = x.dtype
    elif pd.api.types.is_datetime64_dtype(x):
        x = pd.to_datetime(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("datetime64[ns]")
    elif pd.api.types.is_timedelta64_dtype(x):
        x = pd.to_timedelta(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("timedelta64[ns]")
    elif pd.api.types.is_bool_dtype(x):
        x = x.astype(int)  # Convert boolean to int
        dtype = np.dtype("int64")

    if dtype is not None:
        # GH 19768: force NaT to NaN during integer conversion
        x = np.where(x.notna(), x.view(np.int64), np.nan)

    return x, dtype
```

By adding a check for boolean data type and converting it to integer, the function should now be able to handle boolean data as well, and the TypeError should be resolved.
