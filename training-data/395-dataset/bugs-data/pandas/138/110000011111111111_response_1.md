The issue seems to be related to the qcut function which is causing a TypeError related to boolean operations. The error message indicates that boolean subtract operations are not supported and suggests using bitwise_xor or logical_xor functions instead.

The problem could be occurring when qcut tries to interpolate between values for boolean arrays, leading to this TypeError.

To fix the bug, the qcut function needs to handle boolean arrays differently, possibly converting them to a different data type before attempting interpolation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _coerce_to_type(x):
    """
    if the passed data is of datetime/timedelta type,
    this method converts it to numeric so that cut method can handle it
    """
    dtype = None

    if pd.api.types.is_datetime64tz_dtype(x):
        dtype = x.dtype
    elif pd.api.types.is_datetime64_dtype(x):
        x = pd.to_datetime(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("datetime64[ns]")
    elif pd.api.types.is_timedelta64_dtype(x):
        x = pd.to_timedelta(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("timedelta64[ns]")

    if dtype is not None:
        # Convert to int if dtype is boolean
        if np.issubdtype(dtype, np.bool_):
            x = x.astype('int64')

    return x, dtype
```

In this corrected version of the function, after identifying the boolean type, the function casts the array to 'int64' types before returning. This approach should resolve the TypeError related to boolean operations.
