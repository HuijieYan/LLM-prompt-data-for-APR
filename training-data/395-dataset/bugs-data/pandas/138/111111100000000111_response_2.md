The error occurs when trying to convert a boolean Series into a categorical variable using the `pd.qcut()` function. The error message suggests that there is an issue with the data type conversion.

The `TypeError` is caused by the `_coerce_to_type` function within the `tile.py` file. It seems that the problem is related to the conversion of boolean values to a different data type.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to handle boolean data types explicitly within the `_coerce_to_type` function, ensuring that the conversion is handled correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _coerce_to_type(x):
    """
    if the passed data is of datetime/timedelta type,
    this method converts it to numeric so that cut method can
    handle it
    """
    dtype = None

    if is_datetime64tz_dtype(x):
        dtype = x.dtype
    elif is_datetime64_dtype(x):
        x = to_datetime(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("datetime64[ns]")
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(x):
        x = to_timedelta(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("timedelta64[ns]")
    elif np.issubdtype(x.dtype, np.bool_):
        x = x.astype(np.int64)
        
    return x, dtype
```

In the corrected code, after checking for datetime and timedelta data types, an additional check has been added to handle boolean data types. If the input is a boolean Series, it is explicitly converted to an int64 type. This should address the TypeError that was occurring.
