Potential error location:
The potential error is in the `if dtype is not None` condition. It seems that the `notna()` function is being treated as a method instead of being called as a function. This could lead to incorrect behavior when checking for null values.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `notna()` function is being treated as a method, which means it is not being called correctly. This results in incorrect behavior in the if condition, causing the bug.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
Instead of using `.notna`, the correct way to call the function is `notna()`. Additionally, it would be better to define the `np` module at the beginning of the function and use it within the condition.

Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

def _coerce_to_type(x):
    """
    if the passed data is of datetime/timedelta type,
    this method converts it to numeric so that cut method can
    handle it
    """
    dtype = None

    if is_datetime64tz_dtype(x):
        dtype = x.dtype
    elif is_datetime64_dtype(x):
        x = to_datetime(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("datetime64[ns]")
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(x):
        x = to_timedelta(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("timedelta64[ns]")

    if dtype is not None:
        # GH 19768: force NaT to NaN during integer conversion
        x = np.where(np.notna(x), x.view(np.int64), np.nan)

    return x, dtype
```
