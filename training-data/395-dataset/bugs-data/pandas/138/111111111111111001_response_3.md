The error occurs when the `qcut` function tries to interpolate between boolean values. This is due to the presence of boolean arrays as input to the `qcut` function, which is not well-handled.

To fix the bug, the `_coerce_to_type` function should handle boolean arrays differently and convert them to integers to avoid the error during interpolation.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _coerce_to_type(x):
    if is_bool_dtype(x):
        x = x.astype(int)  # Convert boolean array to integer array
        dtype = np.dtype('int64')
    elif is_datetime64tz_dtype(x):
        dtype = x.dtype
    elif is_datetime64_dtype(x):
        x = to_datetime(x)
        dtype = np.dtype('datetime64[ns]')
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(x):
        x = to_timedelta(x)
        dtype = np.dtype('timedelta64[ns]')

    if dtype is not None:
        x = np.where(x.notna(), x.view(np.int64), np.nan)

    return x, dtype
```

In this corrected function, when a boolean array is encountered, it is explicitly converted to an integer array using the `astype` method. This ensures that the subsequent operations within `qcut` will not encounter issues related to boolean subtraction.
