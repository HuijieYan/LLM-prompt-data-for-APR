The buggy function `_coerce_to_type` is experiencing issues due to the operations being performed on boolean data. The error message indicates that the bug is likely occurring due to boolean subtraction operations in the `numpy` library.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
- The function is meant to handle datetime/timedelta data, but the incorrect handling of boolean data is causing the issue.
- Operations involving boolean data are not correctly handled in the current implementation.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the function to explicitly handle boolean data and perform the necessary conversions.
2. Avoid direct arithmetic or subtraction operations on boolean data and ensure that the conversions are carried out correctly.

Below is the corrected function with an updated approach to handle boolean data:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _coerce_to_type(x):
    dtype = None

    if pd.api.types.is_datetime64tz_dtype(x):
        dtype = x.dtype
    elif pd.api.types.is_datetime64_dtype(x):
        x = pd.to_datetime(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("datetime64[ns]")
    elif pd.api.types.is_timedelta64_dtype(x):
        x = pd.to_timedelta(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("timedelta64[ns]")
    elif pd.api.types.is_bool_dtype(x):
        # Convert boolean data to integers (0 and 1)
        x = x.astype(int)
        dtype = np.dtype("int64")
    
    if dtype is not None:
        # Convert NaT to NaN during integer conversion
        x = np.where(np.isnan(x), np.nan, x.view(np.int64))

    return x, dtype
```

In the corrected function, boolean data is explicitly handled using `pd.api.types.is_bool_dtype` to identify boolean data and then converting it to integers. This approach avoids the boolean subtraction-related issues.
