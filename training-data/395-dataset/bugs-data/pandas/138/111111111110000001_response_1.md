The issue seems to be related to the `qcut` function which uses the `_interpolate` function from the `pandas.core.algorithms` module. The error message indicates that a boolean subtraction operation is not supported, causing a TypeError.

The potential error location within the `qcut` function could be the calculation of the score using the `_interpolate` function with boolean values.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `_interpolate` function is being used with boolean values which is not supported in numpy. It seems that this function is expecting numeric values for interpolation, but it is receiving boolean values instead.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the `_interpolate` function is only used with numeric values. This can be achieved by coercing the input data to a numeric type before passing it to the `_interpolate` function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `_coerce_to_type`:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _coerce_to_type(x):
    """
    if the passed data is of datetime/timedelta type,
    this method converts it to numeric so that cut method can
    handle it
    """
    if isinstance(x, (pd.DatetimeIndex, pd.TimedeltaIndex)):
        x = x.astype(np.int64)
        dtype = np.dtype("datetime64[ns]")
    else:
        dtype = None

    return x, dtype
```

In this corrected version, the function checks if the input data is of datetime/timedelta types using `isinstance` and then coerces the data to numeric using `astype` if required. This should prevent the boolean subtraction issue reported in the error message.
