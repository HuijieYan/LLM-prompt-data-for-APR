Potential error location:
The error is likely occurring within the `_coerce_to_type` function, where the data type is being converted to handle it in the `cut` method.

Reasons behind the bug:
The bug is likely occurring due to the incorrect handling of datetime/timedelta data types within the `_coerce_to_type` function, which is causing errors when using the `cut` method.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the data type of the input x and handle datetime/timedelta types correctly.
2. Ensure that the data type conversion is done properly so that it can be handled by the `cut` method without causing errors.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _coerce_to_type(x):
    """
    if the passed data is of datetime/timedelta type,
    this method converts it to numeric so that cut method can
    handle it
    """
    dtype = None

    if pd.api.types.is_datetime64tz_dtype(x):
        dtype = x.dtype
    elif pd.api.types.is_datetime64_dtype(x):
        x = pd.to_datetime(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("datetime64[ns]")
    elif pd.api.types.is_timedelta64_dtype(x):
        x = pd.to_timedelta(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("timedelta64[ns]")

    if dtype is not None:
        # GH 19768: force NaT to NaN during integer conversion
        x = np.where(x.notna(), x.view(np.int64), np.nan)

    return x, dtype
```
