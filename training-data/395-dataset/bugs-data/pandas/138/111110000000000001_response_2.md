Potential error location: 
The bug is likely to be at the lines where the function is_datetime64tz_dtype, is_datetime64_dtype, and is_timedelta64_dtype are being called. These are likely custom functions outside of the provided code, and if they are not properly defined or available, they will raise an error.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the functions is_datetime64tz_dtype, is_datetime64_dtype, and is_timedelta64_dtype are not defined in the given code. Similarly, the functions to_datetime and to_timedelta are also not defined.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define the missing functions (is_datetime64tz_dtype, is_datetime64_dtype, is_timedelta64_dtype, to_datetime, and to_timedelta) within the code.
2. If the missing functions are part of a library or package, make sure that the library or package is imported and properly installed.

Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _coerce_to_type(x):
    """
    if the passed data is of datetime/timedelta type,
    this method converts it to numeric so that cut method can
    handle it
    """
    dtype = None

    if isinstance(x, pd.DatetimeTZDtype):
        dtype = x.dtype
    elif isinstance(x, pd.DatetimeTZDtype):
        x = pd.to_datetime(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("datetime64[ns]")
    elif isinstance(x, pd.TimedeltaDtype):
        x = pd.to_timedelta(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("timedelta64[ns]")

    if dtype is not None:
        # GH 19768: force NaT to NaN during integer conversion
        x = np.where(x.notna(), x.view(np.int64), np.nan)

    return x, dtype
```
