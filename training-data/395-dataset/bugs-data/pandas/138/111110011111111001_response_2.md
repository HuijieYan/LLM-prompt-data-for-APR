The error occurs in the `_coerce_to_type` function and is related to handling of boolean values. The error message mentions a "TypeError: numpy boolean subtract" when trying to interpolate the data.

The bug occurs due to the conversion of boolean values to int64 within the function. When attempting to perform arithmetic operations (specifically subtraction) on boolean values, it causes a TypeError because boolean data types do not support these operations.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle boolean values differently and avoid the TypeError when attempting arithmetic operations on them.

Here's the corrected code for the `_coerce_to_type` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _coerce_to_type(x):
    """
    if the passed data is of datetime/timedelta type,
    this method converts it to numeric so that cut method can
    handle it.
    """
    if isinstance(x, pd.Series) and x.dtype == 'bool':
        x = x.astype('int64')
    elif isinstance(x, pd.Series) and pd.api.types.is_datetime64tz_dtype(x):
        x = pd.to_datetime(x)
    elif isinstance(x, pd.Series) and pd.api.types.is_datetime64_dtype(x):
        x = pd.to_datetime(x)
    elif isinstance(x, pd.Series) and pd.api.types.is_timedelta64_dtype(x):
        x = pd.to_timedelta(x)
    
    return x
```

In the corrected function, boolean values are specifically converted to 'int64' using the `astype` method to avoid any potential TypeError related to arithmetic operations.

This should resolve the issue with handling boolean values and prevent the TypeError mentioned in the error message.
