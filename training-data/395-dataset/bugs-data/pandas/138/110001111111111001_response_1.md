The buggy function `_coerce_to_type` has multiple bugs at different locations. The main issue is that the function is not handling the input types properly and is not performing the desired operations on the input data. The function is also confusing data types and instances, leading to incorrect operations.

The function should identify if the input data is of datetime/timedelta type, and then convert it to numeric so that the `cut` method can handle it. However, the function is not performing the correct conversions and is causing type and data mismatches.

To fix the bugs, we need to:
1. Properly handle the different types of input data, such as Series, ndarray, and dtype.
2. Ensure that the conversions are done correctly for datetime and timedelta types.
3. Use appropriate methods and operations for the specific data types, such as performing arithmetic operations only on numeric data and using the correct type conversions.

Here's the corrected code for the `_coerce_to_type` function:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def _coerce_to_type(x):
    """
    if the passed data is of datetime/timedelta type,
    this method converts it to numeric so that cut method can
    handle it
    """
    if isinstance(x, pd.Series):
        # Handle Series input
        if x.dtype == 'datetime64[ns]' or x.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]':
            x = x.astype(np.int64)
    elif isinstance(x, np.ndarray):
        # Handle ndarray input
        if x.dtype == 'datetime64[ns]' or x.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]':
            x = x.astype(np.int64)
    else:
        # Handle other input types
        if isinstance(x, pd.DatetimeIndex) or isinstance(x, pd.TimedeltaIndex):
            x = x.to_series().astype(np.int64)
        elif isinstance(x, pd.DatetimeTZDtype) or isinstance(x, pd.TimedeltaTZDtype):
            x = x.to_series().astype(np.int64)

    return x
```

This corrected function handles different types of input data properly, performs the necessary type conversions for datetime/timedelta types, and ensures that the cut method can handle the converted data.
