The error is occurring in the `qcut` method, which is calling the `_interpolate` function from `pandas/core/algorithms.py`. The error message indicates that a boolean subtract operation is being performed, which is not supported.

The reason for the error is that the data being passed to the `qcut` method is of boolean type. This is causing the subtraction operation to throw a TypeError.

To fix this bug, the `_coerce_to_type` function should be updated to handle boolean data appropriately. Since the problem is with boolean data, it should be coerced into a numeric type before being passed to the `qcut` method.

Here's the corrected version of the `_coerce_to_type` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _coerce_to_type(x):
    dtype = None

    if is_datetime64tz_dtype(x):
        dtype = x.dtype
    elif is_datetime64_dtype(x):
        x = to_datetime(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("datetime64[ns]")
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(x):
        x = to_timedelta(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("timedelta64[ns]")
    elif x.dtype == bool:
        x = x.astype(int)  # convert boolean to integer
        dtype = np.dtype("int64")

    if dtype is not None:
        # force NaT to NaN during integer conversion
        x = np.where(x.notna(), x.view(np.int64), np.nan)

    return x, dtype
```

By explicitly handling boolean data and converting it to an integer type, the bug should be fixed and the `qcut` method should no longer raise a TypeError.
