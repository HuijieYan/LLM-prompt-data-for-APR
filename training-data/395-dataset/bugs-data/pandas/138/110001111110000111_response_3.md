The error occurs when trying to convert boolean values to integers when using the `qcut` function in Pandas. This leads to a TypeError related to boolean subtraction not being supported.

The potential error location is within the `_coerce_to_type` function, specifically in the line where boolean values are converted to integers using the `np.where` function.

This error occurs because the `np.where` function is not used correctly to convert boolean values to integers. Instead, it is producing the TypeError due to boolean subtraction. 

To fix this bug, we need to modify the way boolean values are being coerced to integers. We can use the `astype` method to explicitly convert boolean values to integers. This modification will ensure that the conversion is done correctly without triggering any TypeErrors related to boolean subtraction.

Here is the corrected `_coerce_to_type` function:

```python
def _coerce_to_type(x):
    """
    if the passed data is of datetime/timedelta type,
    this method converts it to numeric so that cut method can
    handle it
    """
    dtype = None

    if is_datetime64tz_dtype(x):
        dtype = x.dtype
    elif is_datetime64_dtype(x):
        x = to_datetime(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("datetime64[ns]")
    elif is_timedelta64_dtype(x):
        x = to_timedelta(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("timedelta64[ns]")

    if dtype is not None:
        # Convert boolean values to integers
        x = x.astype(int)

    return x, dtype
```

With this modification, the issue related to boolean subtraction and the TypeError should be resolved.
