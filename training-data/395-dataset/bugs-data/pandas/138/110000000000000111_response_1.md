Potential error location: The _coerce_to_type function provided is intended to convert datetime and timedelta types to numeric so that the cut method can handle them. However, the function is not handling all the cases properly which may lead to the TypeError mentioned in the GitHub issue.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The function is not handling all possible cases for datetime and timedelta types. This could lead to incorrect conversions, which then cause issues when used with other methods, such as pandas qcut.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: The function should properly handle all cases of datetime and timedelta types and ensure that the conversions are done correctly. Additionally, any potential operations that could result in the TypeError mentioned in the GitHub issue should be addressed.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _coerce_to_type(x):
    """
    if the passed data is of datetime/timedelta type,
    this method converts it to numeric so that cut method can
    handle it
    """
    dtype = None

    if pd.api.types.is_datetime64tz_dtype(x):
        dtype = x.dtype
    elif pd.api.types.is_datetime64_dtype(x):
        x = pd.to_datetime(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("datetime64[ns]")
    elif pd.api.types.is_timedelta64_dtype(x):
        x = pd.to_timedelta(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("timedelta64[ns]")

    if dtype is not None:
        # Ensure null and NaT are handled properly
        x = np.where(pd.notna(x), x.view(np.float64), np.nan)

    return x, dtype
