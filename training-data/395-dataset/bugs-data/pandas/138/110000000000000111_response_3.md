The bug in the code is likely related to how the function `_coerce_to_type` is converting datetime/timedelta types to numeric data. This is causing issues when the `qcut` method is trying to handle the data.

The error message `TypeError: Cannot cast ufunc multiply output from dtype('float64') to dtype('bool') with casting rule 'same_kind'` indicates that there is a problem with casting from float64 to bool.

The method `_coerce_to_type` is not properly handling datetime/timedelta types, leading to incorrect data conversions and subsequent errors when the data is passed to the `qcut` method.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the conversion of datetime/timedelta types to numeric data is correctly performed in the `_coerce_to_type` function.

Here's the corrected method:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _coerce_to_type(x):
    """
    if the passed data is of datetime/timedelta type,
    this method converts it to numeric so that cut method can
    handle it
    """
    dtype = None

    if isinstance(x, pd.DatetimeTZDtype):
        dtype = x
    elif isinstance(x, pd.DatetimeDtype):
        x = x.astype('datetime64[ns]')
        dtype = np.dtype("datetime64[ns]")
    elif isinstance(x, pd.TimedeltaDtype):
        x = x.to_numpy()
        dtype = np.dtype("timedelta64[ns]")

    if dtype is not None:
        # Force NaT to NaN during integer conversion
        x = np.where(~np.isnat(x), x.view(np.int64), np.nan)

    return x, dtype
```
