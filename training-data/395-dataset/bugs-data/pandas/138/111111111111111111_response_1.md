The error stems from the `_coerce_to_type` function in the `pandas.core.reshape.tile` module. This function is meant to handle datetime and timedelta types and convert them to numeric so that the `qcut` function can handle them.

The issue is caused by the function not properly handling boolean values, leading to TypeError when the `qcut` function is called. This results in a problem with subtracting boolean values, which needs to be resolved.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that boolean types are properly converted to numeric values before using them in the `qcut` function. This can be achieved by explicitly converting boolean values to integers in the `_coerce_to_type` function.

Below is the corrected code for the `_coerce_to_type` function:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _coerce_to_type(x):
    """
    if the passed data is of datetime/timedelta type,
    this method converts it to numeric so that cut method can
    handle it
    """
    dtype = None

    if pd.api.types.is_datetime64tz_dtype(x):
        dtype = x.dtype
    elif pd.api.types.is_datetime64_dtype(x):
        x = pd.to_datetime(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("datetime64[ns]")
    elif pd.api.types.is_timedelta64_dtype(x):
        x = pd.to_timedelta(x)
        dtype = np.dtype("timedelta64[ns]")
    elif isinstance(x, pd.Series) and x.dtype == bool:
        x = x.astype(int)  # Convert boolean values to integers

    if dtype is not None:
        x = np.where(x.notna(), x.view(np.int64), np.nan)

    return x, dtype
```

By explicitly converting boolean values to integers, the corrected function ensures that boolean values are handled properly and can be used in the `qcut` function without causing a TypeError.
