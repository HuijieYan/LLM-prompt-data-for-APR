The provided error message and test case suggest that the bug is located in the `astype` method of the `StringArray` class. The error message indicates that the data type is not understood when trying to convert a `StringArray` with `StringDtype` to `Int64Dtype`.

The bug occurs because the `astype` method is unable to handle the conversion from `StringDtype` to `Int64Dtype` properly. This is likely due to the implementation not recognizing how to handle the conversion between these specific data types.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to modify the `astype` method to properly handle the conversion from `StringDtype` to `Int64Dtype` by explicitly handling this conversion case and using appropriate typecasting mechanisms.

Here's the corrected `astype` method:

```python
class StringArray(PandasArray):
    # ... other code ...

    def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
        dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)
        target_dtype = pandas_dtype("Int64")
        
        if isinstance(dtype, StringDtype) and target_dtype != self.dtype:
            values = pd.to_numeric(self._ndarray, errors="coerce")
            return pd.array(values, dtype=target_dtype)

        return super().astype(dtype, copy)
```

In the corrected code, we explicitly handle the case where the input `dtype` is a `StringDtype` and the target data type is `Int64`. We use `pd.to_numeric` to convert the values to numeric type, and then create a new `pd.array` with the target data type of `Int64`.

This approach ensures that the `astype` method handles the specific conversion case from `StringDtype` to `Int64` correctly, resolving the issue identified in the bug report.
