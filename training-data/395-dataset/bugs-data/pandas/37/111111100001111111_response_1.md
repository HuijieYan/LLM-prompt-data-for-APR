The issue is occurring in the `astype` method of the `StringArray` class. The `astype` method is intended to convert the series to a specified data type. However, it is unable to handle the conversion from `StringDtype` to `Int64Dtype` directly.

The bug is likely occurring because the method is not properly handling the conversion from `StringDtype` to `Int64Dtype`. The `astype` method should be able to handle this conversion without requiring the use of `pd.to_numeric` and `convert_dtypes`.

To fix this bug, the `astype` method needs to be updated to properly handle the conversion from `StringDtype` to `Int64Dtype`. This can be achieved by checking the input data type and performing the appropriate conversion.

Here's the corrected code for the `astype` method:

```python
def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
    dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)
    if isinstance(dtype, StringDtype) and str(dtype) == 'Int64':
        arr = pd.to_numeric(self._ndarray, errors='coerce')
        return arr.astype(dtype).to_numpy()
    if copy:
        return self.copy()
    return self
```

This updated method checks if the input `dtype` is of type `StringDtype` and is equal to 'Int64'. If so, it uses `pd.to_numeric` to convert the `self._ndarray` to numeric and then converts it to the specified `dtype`. Otherwise, it follows the previous logic for handling the copy and return behavior.

With this fix, the `astype` method should now properly handle the conversion from `StringDtype` to `Int64Dtype` without needing additional steps from the user.
