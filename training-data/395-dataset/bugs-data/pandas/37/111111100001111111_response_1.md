The issue is occurring in the `astype` method of the `StringArray` class. The bug causes a TypeError when trying to convert a `StringDtype` series to an `Int64Dtype`.

The issue is likely happening because the `astype` method is not handling the conversion from `StringDtype` to `Int64Dtype` properly. It seems that the method is not recognizing the input type and is raising a "data type not understood" error.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to modify the `astype` method to properly handle the conversion between `StringDtype` and `Int64Dtype`. The method should check for the input data type and perform the conversion accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `astype` method:

```python
    def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
        dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)
        if isinstance(dtype, pd.StringDtype) and dtype == pd.StringDtype():
            if copy:
                return self.copy()
            return self
        elif dtype == 'Int64':
            return pd.Series(self._ndarray).astype('Int64')
        return super().astype(dtype, copy)
```

In the corrected code, the method now explicitly checks for the case when the desired dtype is 'Int64' and uses `pd.Series(self._ndarray).astype('Int64')` to perform the conversion.

This fix should resolve the TypeError encountered when trying to convert from `StringDtype` to `Int64Dtype`.
