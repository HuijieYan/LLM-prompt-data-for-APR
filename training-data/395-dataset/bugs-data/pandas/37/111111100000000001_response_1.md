The potential error in the code is the handling of the `dtype` parameter within the `astype` method of the `StringArray` class. The code mistakenly assumes that if the `dtype` is an instance of `StringDtype`, it should return a copy of the string array if `copy` is True, and the original array if `copy` is False. If the `dtype` is not an instance of `StringDtype`, it calls the `astype` method of the superclass.

The bug occurs because the code does not actually perform any type conversion based on the `dtype` parameter. It only checks if the `dtype` is an instance of `StringDtype` and then returns a copy or the original array without any conversion.

To fix the bug, the `astype` method should actually perform the type conversion based on the `dtype` parameter, and then return the converted array.

Here's the corrected code for the `astype` method:

```python
def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
    if isinstance(dtype, str):
        dtype = pandas.api.types.pandas_dtype(dtype)
    converted_array = self._from_sequence(self._data.astype(dtype), copy=copy)
    return converted_array
```

In this corrected code:
- We first check if the `dtype` is a string, and if so, we convert it to a Pandas dtype.
- Then we use the `_from_sequence` method to create a new StringArray with the data converted to the specified `dtype` and with the option to make a copy if `copy` is True.
- Finally, we return the converted array.
