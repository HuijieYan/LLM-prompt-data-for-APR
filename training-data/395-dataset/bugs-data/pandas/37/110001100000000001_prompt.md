# relative function's signature in this file
def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass



    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
        dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)
        if isinstance(dtype, StringDtype):
            if copy:
                return self.copy()
            return self
        return super().astype(dtype, copy)
    
```
