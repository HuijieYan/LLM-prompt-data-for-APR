The bug is occurring in the `astype` method of the `StringArray` class. The method is designed to convert the array to a specified data type (`dtype`) and an optional copy parameter. The bug causes an issue when trying to convert a StringDtype series to an Int64Dtype directly using `astype`.

The reason for the bug is that the `astype` method does not handle the conversion from StringDtype to Int64Dtype correctly, resulting in a TypeError. This is because the current implementation does not support this specific type of conversion.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `astype` method to properly handle the conversion from StringDtype to Int64Dtype. This can be done by explicitly checking for this conversion case and implementing the appropriate logic to perform the conversion.

Here's the corrected code for the `astype` method:

```python
def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
    dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)
    if isinstance(dtype, StringDtype) and issubclass(dtype, pd.Int64Dtype):
        return pd.to_numeric(self, errors='coerce').convert_dtypes()
    if copy:
        return self.copy()
    return self
```

With this correction, the `astype` method properly handles the conversion from StringDtype to Int64Dtype, using `pd.to_numeric` and `convert_dtypes` to perform the conversion.
