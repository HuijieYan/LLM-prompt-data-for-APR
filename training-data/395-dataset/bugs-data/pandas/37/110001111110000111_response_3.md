The test case is trying to convert a StringDtype series to an Int64Dtype, but it is encountering a TypeError when calling the `astype` function.

The potential error location within the `astype` function is the line `return np.array(self, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)`. This is an incorrect way to cast the array to a NumPy array with the specified dtype.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `astype` function is not handling the conversion from StringDtype to Int64Dtype correctly. It is trying to use `np.array` to perform the conversion, which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, the `astype` function should handle the conversion from StringDtype to Int64Dtype directly by using the `pd.to_numeric` function. This function can convert a series of strings to numeric values, and then we can use `convert_dtypes` to convert it to the desired dtype.

Here is the corrected code for the `astype` function:

```python
def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
    dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)
    if isinstance(dtype, StringDtype) and str(dtype) == 'Int64':
        return pd.to_numeric(self, errors='coerce').convert_dtypes()
    else:
        return super().astype(dtype, copy)
```

With this corrected code, the `astype` function will correctly handle the conversion from StringDtype to Int64Dtype and return the expected result.
