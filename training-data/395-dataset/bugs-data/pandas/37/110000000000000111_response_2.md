Potential Error Location: The issue seems to be arising from the astype() method, specifically when trying to convert from StringDtype to Int64. 

Reasons for the Bug: The bug is likely caused by the astype() method not correctly handling the conversion between StringDtype and Int64.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: We can modify the astype() method to explicitly handle the conversion from StringDtype to Int64.

Corrected Code:

```python
def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
    dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)
    if isinstance(self.dtype, StringDtype) and dtype == 'Int64':
        return self.convert_dtypes()
    return super().astype(dtype, copy)
```
