Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the handling of the `dtype` parameter in the `astype` function. It is not correctly recognizing the input as the intended `Int64` dtype.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the function is not correctly identifying the input `dtype` as the desired `Int64` dtype. This results in a TypeError as the function attempts to handle the input.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The function should correctly recognize the input `dtype` and handle it as the intended `Int64` dtype. This may involve modifying the logic for identifying and handling the `dtype` parameter.

Corrected code:

```python
def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
    dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)
    if dtype == 'Int64':
        dtype = Int64Dtype()
    if isinstance(dtype, StringDtype):
        if copy:
            return self.copy()
        return self
    return super().astype(dtype, copy)
```
