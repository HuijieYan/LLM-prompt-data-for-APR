The issue with the given function is that it is trying to convert the dtype to a pandas_dtype using the `pandas_dtype()` function, which does not exist. Additionally, the `StringDtype` and `Int64Dtype` are not being handled properly.

To fix this, we need to handle the conversion of the input `dtype` to the corresponding `pandas` dtype and also handle the case when the dtype is `Int64`. We can use the `pandas.api.types.cast()` function to handle the dtype conversion.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import pandas.api.types as ptypes

def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
    if dtype == 'Int64':
        dtype = 'int64'
    try:
        dtype = ptypes.cast(dtype, copy=copy)
    except:
        pass
    if isinstance(dtype, str) and dtype.lower() == 'string':
        if copy:
            return self.copy()
        return self
    return super().astype(dtype, copy)
```
