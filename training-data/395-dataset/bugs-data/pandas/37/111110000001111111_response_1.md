The bug occurs in the `astype` method of the `StringArray` class. The error occurs because when trying to convert the StringDtype series to the Int64Dtype series using `astype('Int64')`, the data type is not being properly understood.

The reason for this bug is that the original implementation of the `astype` method does not handle the conversion from StringDtype to Int64Dtype properly.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `astype` method to handle the conversion from StringDtype to Int64Dtype properly. We should check if the target dtype is an instance of Int64Dtype and then perform the conversion accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `astype` method:

```python
    def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
        dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)
        if isinstance(dtype, StringDtype):
            if copy:
                return self.copy()
            return self
        elif isinstance(dtype, Int64Dtype):
            # Convert to numeric and then to Int64Dtype
            arr = pd.to_numeric(self._ndarray, errors='coerce')
            return arr.astype("Int64")
        return super().astype(dtype, copy)
```

With this correction, the `astype` method will correctly handle the conversion from StringDtype to Int64Dtype.
