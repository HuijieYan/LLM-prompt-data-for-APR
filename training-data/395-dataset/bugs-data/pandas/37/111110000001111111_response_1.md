The bug occurs in the `astype` method of the `StringArray` class. The `astype` method is intended to convert the data type of the array. In the provided test case, the input parameter `dtype` is a string 'Int64' but the expected dtype of the array is `Int64Dtype()`.

The reason behind the bug is that the `astype` method is not correctly handling the conversion from `StringDtype` to `Int64Dtype`. The code is checking if the provided dtype is an instance of `StringDtype`, but it should also include a check for the target dtype `Int64Dtype` and handle the conversion appropriately.

To fix the bug, the `astype` method should be modified to check for both `StringDtype` and `Int64Dtype`, and handle the conversion from `StringDtype` to `Int64Dtype` accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `astype` method:

```python
def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
    if isinstance(dtype, str) and dtype.lower() == 'int64':
        converted_array = pd.to_numeric(self._ndarray, errors='coerce')
        return converted_array.astype('Int64')
    else:
        return super().astype(dtype, copy)
```

In this corrected code, if the provided dtype is 'Int64', it uses `pd.to_numeric` to convert the array to numeric values and then applies `.astype('Int64')` to convert it to `Int64Dtype`. If the provided dtype is something else, it falls back to the default behavior by calling the parent class's `astype` method.

With this correction, the `astype` method should now correctly handle the conversion from `StringDtype` to `Int64Dtype`.
