The bug occurs in the `astype` method of the `StringArray` class when trying to convert a string array to an Int64Dtype. The TypeError "data type not understood" is thrown, indicating that the dtype is not recognized during the conversion.

The potential error location is identified within the `astype` method, specifically in the line where `return np.array(self, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)` is used to perform the conversion.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `np.array` method may not be able to handle the conversion from a StringDtype to an Int64Dtype directly.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to handle the conversion from a StringDtype to an Int64Dtype explicitly. This can be achieved by first converting the string array to numeric using the `pd.to_numeric` method and then converting the dtype to Int64 using `convert_dtypes`.

Here's the corrected code for the `astype` method:

```python
def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
    dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)
    if isinstance(dtype, StringDtype):
        if dtype == "Int64":
            return pd.to_numeric(self, errors="coerce").convert_dtypes()
        if copy:
            return self.copy()
        return self
    return super().astype(dtype, copy)
```

With this corrected code, the conversion from StringDtype to Int64Dtype should work as expected, and the TypeError should no longer be thrown when performing the conversion.
