The error occurs in the astype method of the StringArray class. The error message suggests that the data type "Int64" is not being understood by the astype function.

The potential error location is in the line:
```python
return np.array(self, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that "Int64" is not being properly handled by the astype function. The astype function is trying to create a numpy array without handling the case when the dtype is an extension type like "Int64".

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when the dtype is an extension type separately.

Below is the corrected code for the astype method:

```python
def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
    dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)
    if isinstance(dtype, StringDtype):
        if copy:
            return self.copy()
        return self
    elif is_extension_array_dtype(dtype):
        # If dtype is an extension type, cast the data to the extension type
        data = np.array(self._ndarray, dtype='object')
        array = dtype.construct_array_type()._from_sequence(data)
        return array
    else:
        return super().astype(dtype, copy)
```
