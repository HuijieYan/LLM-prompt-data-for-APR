The error here is occurring in the `astype` method of the StringArray class, when trying to convert the array to "Int64". The error message indicates a "TypeError: data type not understood", which suggests that the conversion is not working as intended.

The potential error location is the `return super().astype(dtype, copy)` line in the `astype` method.

The bug is likely occurring because the `astype` method is not handling the conversion to a different data type correctly. Specifically, it seems to be trying to use `np.array` to perform the conversion, which is not the correct way to cast a StringArray to a different data type.

To fix the bug, the `astype` method should be modified to handle the conversion to different data types in a way that is appropriate for the StringArray class.

Here's the corrected `astype` method:

```python
# Corrected astype method
def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
    if isinstance(dtype, str) and dtype.startswith("Int"):
        return pd.array(self, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)
    else:
        return super().astype(dtype, copy=copy)
```

In the corrected method, we check if the `dtype` is a string and starts with "Int". If it does, we directly create a new StringArray with the specified integer type using `pd.array`. Otherwise, we delegate to the parent class's `astype` method using `super()`.
