The error message "TypeError: data type not understood" suggests that there is an issue with the data type conversion in the `astype` function.

The bug is likely in the line `dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)` because it is trying to convert the dtype to a pandas dtype without actually using pandas' functionality for dtype conversion.

The bug occurred because the `astype` function is not properly handling the conversion of string type data to the specified integer dtype.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the dtype is correctly converted to the desired integer dtype. We can achieve this by using the `pandas.to_numeric` method to handle the conversion from the string data type to the specified integer dtype.

Here's the corrected code for the `astype` function:

```python
def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
    dtype = pd.to_numeric(dtype, errors='coerce')
    if isinstance(dtype, pd.Int64Dtype):
        new_data = pd.to_numeric(self, errors='coerce')
        if copy:
            return new_data.copy()
        return new_data
    return super().astype(dtype, copy)
```

With this correction, the `astype` function will properly handle the conversion of string data to the specified integer dtype, resolving the TypeError that was previously encountered.
