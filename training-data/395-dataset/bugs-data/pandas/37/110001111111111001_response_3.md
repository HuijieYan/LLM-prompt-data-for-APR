The error occurs when the function `astype` tries to convert the data type to 'Int64'. The bug is in the way the type conversion is being handled within the `astype` method. The current method is not handling the type conversion appropriately, leading to a `TypeError: data type not understood` error.

In the buggy function, the `astype` method is trying to cast to a NumPy array with 'dtype', and it's returning `np.array(self, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)`. The issue lies in the fact that `dtype` is directly being used in this line, but it needs to be converted into a valid dtype object before being used in the `np.array` method.

One possible approach to fix this bug is to use the `pandas.api.types.pandas_dtype` method to convert `dtype` into a valid pandas data type object before calling `np.array`. This will ensure that the dtype is understood and can be used in the `np.array` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `astype` method:

```python
import pandas.api.types as pdtypes

def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
    dtype = pdtypes.pandas_dtype(dtype)
    if isinstance(dtype, pdtypes.StringDtype):
        if copy:
            return self.copy()
        return self
    return np.array(self, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)
```
