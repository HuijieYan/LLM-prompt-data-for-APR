Potential Error Location:
The issue appears to be in the `astype` method of the `StringArray` class. Specifically, the `astype` method is currently not returning a pandas Series or Array, which is causing the TypeError.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The current implementation of the `astype` method does not handle the case when the `dtype` parameter is an instance of `Int64Dtype`. This results in a TypeError as it is unable to understand the data type.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
The `astype` method should be modified to handle different data types, including the case when the `dtype` parameter is of type `Int64Dtype`. It should return the appropriate pandas Series or Array based on the specified `dtype`.

Corrected Code:
```python
def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
    dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)
    if isinstance(dtype, StringDtype):
        if copy:
            return self.copy()
        return self
    elif isinstance(dtype, pd.Int64Dtype):
        # return the array as a new instance with the specified dtype
        return self._from_sequence(self.data, dtype=dtype)
    return super().astype(dtype, copy)
```
