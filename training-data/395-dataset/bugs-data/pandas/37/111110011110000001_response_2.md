The test case `test_astype_int` is attempting to convert an array of strings to an array of integers using the `astype` method. The error message indicates that the data type is not understood, which suggests that there may be an issue with the conversion of the data type within the `astype` method of the `StringArray` class.

Upon inspecting the `astype` method, the issue appears to be with the line `return np.array(self, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)`, which attempts to use `np.array` to convert the data type. This approach is not appropriate for extension arrays like `StringArray`, which needs a different conversion mechanism.

The bug occurs because the `astype` method is not customizing the conversion process for the extension array specific data types. As a result, the standard data type conversion mechanism is used, leading to the error.

To fix this bug, the `astype` method in the `StringArray` class should be overridden to handle the specific conversion process for the `StringArray` data type.

Here's the corrected code for the `astype` method in the `StringArray` class:

```python
    def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
        dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)
        if isinstance(dtype, StringDtype):
            if copy:
                return self.copy()
            return self
        if is_integer_dtype(dtype):
            # Assuming self._ndarray is the array-like data in the StringArray
            # Convert string representations of integers to actual integers
            values = np.array([int(x) if x is not pd.NA and x is not None else x for x in self._ndarray])
            return type(self)(values)
        return super().astype(dtype, copy)
```

In this corrected code, when the target data type is identified as an integer type, the conversion is handled specifically for the `StringArray` by converting the string representations of integers to actual integers, while handling missing values appropriately. This approach customizes the conversion process for the `StringArray` data type, addressing the bug.
