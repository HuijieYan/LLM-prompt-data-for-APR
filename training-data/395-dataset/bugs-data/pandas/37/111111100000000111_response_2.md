The problem with the `astype` method seems to be that it is not correctly handling the conversion from StringDtype to Int64Dtype. When attempting to convert a StringDtype series to Int64, it is throwing a TypeError.

The bug seems to be located in the `astype` method within the `StringArray` class. The method is not properly handling the conversion to Int64Dtype.

The reason behind the bug is that the `astype` method is not checking for the specific case of converting from StringDtype to Int64Dtype and is not performing the conversion correctly.

To fix the bug, the `astype` method should specifically handle the case of converting from StringDtype to Int64Dtype and perform the necessary conversion.

Here's the corrected code for the `astype` method:

```python
def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
    dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)
    if isinstance(dtype, StringDtype):
        if isinstance(dtype, IntegerDtype):
            if copy:
                return self._values.astype(int).astype(dtype)
            return self._values.astype(int)
        if copy:
            return self.copy()
        return self
    return super().astype(dtype, copy)
```
In the corrected code, we check if the `dtype` is an instance of `StringDtype` and also check if it is an instance of `IntegerDtype`. If it is, then we handle the conversion to Int64Dtype by first converting the values to int and then to the specified dtype. Otherwise, we continue with the original logic for handling other dtypes.

This should ensure that the conversion from StringDtype to Int64Dtype is handled correctly within the `astype` method.
