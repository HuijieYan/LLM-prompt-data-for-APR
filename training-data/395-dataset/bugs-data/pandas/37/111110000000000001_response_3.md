Potential error location: The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement `if isinstance(dtype, StringDtype):`. This statement checks if the dtype is an instance of the StringDtype class, but it is missing an import for the StringDtype class.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the StringDtype class is referenced in the conditional statement, but it has not been imported, so the code will raise an error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, we need to import the StringDtype class from the pandas library at the beginning of the file. Once the StringDtype class is imported, it can be used in the conditional statement without any errors.

Corrected code:

```python
# import the required class
from pandas.api.types import StringDtype

# class declaration containing the buggy function
class StringArray(PandasArray):
    # ... (other methods and attributes) ...

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # this is the corrected function
    def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
        # import the required class
        from pandas.api.types import pandas_dtype
        
        dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)
        
        if isinstance(dtype, StringDtype):
            if copy:
                return self.copy()
            return self
        
        return super().astype(dtype, copy)
```
