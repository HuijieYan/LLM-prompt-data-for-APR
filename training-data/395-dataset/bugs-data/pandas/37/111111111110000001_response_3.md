The error message indicates that there is a TypeError when trying to cast the string array to 'Int64' dtype.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the 'astype' method. The issue could be related to the way the type conversion is being handled.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the 'astype' method is incorrectly trying to cast the string array to a NumPy ndarray with 'dtype'. The current implementation is not handling the type conversion correctly.

To fix the bug, the 'astype' method in the StringArray class should be modified to correctly handle the type conversion without directly using np.array for the cast.

```python
# Corrected code for the problematic function
def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
    dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)
    if isinstance(dtype, StringDtype):
        if copy:
            return self.copy()
        return self
    return self._from_sequence(self._map_to_sequence(), dtype=dtype)
```
