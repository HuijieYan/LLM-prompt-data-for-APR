The error occurs in the `astype` method of the `StringArray` class in the pandas library. The `astype` method should be able to convert a `StringDtype` to an `Int64Dtype`. However, the current implementation is causing a TypeError.

The bug occurs because the method is trying to cast the series directly to a numpy array using `np.array(self, dtype=dtype, copy=copy)`. It seems that casting directly to an Int64Dtype is not supported in this manner.

To fix the bug, it would be better to use the `pandas.to_numeric` function to convert the strings to numeric values with errors coerced to NaN, and then convert the result to nullable integers using the `convert_dtypes` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `astype` method:

```python
def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
    dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)
    if isinstance(dtype, Int64Dtype):
        return pd.to_numeric(self._ndarray, errors='coerce').astype('Int64')
    return super().astype(dtype, copy)
```

In this corrected implementation, we are first checking if the provided dtype is an instance of `Int64Dtype`, and if so, we are using `pd.to_numeric` to convert the values to numeric with errors coerced to NaN, and then using `astype('Int64')` to convert the result to nullable integers. If the dtype is not `Int64Dtype`, we are delegating to the parent class's `astype` method.

This corrected approach should resolve the TypeError and allow the conversion from `StringDtype` to `Int64Dtype` as intended.
