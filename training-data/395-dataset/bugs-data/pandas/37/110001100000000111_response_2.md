Potential error location:
The issue seems to be with the astype function within the pandas.core.arrays.string_ module. The function is not handling the conversion from StringDtype to Int64Dtype correctly.

Reasons behind the bug:
The bug occurs because the astype function is not appropriately handling the conversion from StringDtype to Int64Dtype. It is not recognizing the target dtype 'Int64' and is failing to perform the conversion.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the dtype conversion logic within the astype function to ensure it correctly identifies and handles the conversion to Int64Dtype.
2. Handle the conversion from StringDtype to Int64Dtype as a special case within the astype function, to ensure it is processed correctly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def astype(self, dtype, copy=True):
    dtype = pandas_dtype(dtype)
    if isinstance(dtype, StringDtype):
        if dtype == 'Int64':
            return pd.to_numeric(self, errors='coerce').astype('Int64')
        if copy:
            return self.copy()
        return self
    return super().astype(dtype, copy)
```
