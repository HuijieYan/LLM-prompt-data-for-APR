The problematic function `apply_empty_result` seems to be designed to handle empty data frames and apply functions to them. It checks whether the function to be applied is a reduction function, and if not, it tries to apply the function to an empty series. Based on the results, it determines whether to reduce the result or return a copy of the original data frame.

The bug likely occurs in the logic for inferring whether the result should be reduced. The function checks if the `should_reduce` flag is `True`, else tries to apply the function to an empty series and infer whether the result should be reduced based on the type of the result. However, in the bug cases, the function fails to correctly infer whether the result should be reduced based on the type of the result.

To fix this bug, you can modify the logic for inferring whether the result should be reduced based on the actual type of the result obtained after applying the function to the empty series.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"
    from pandas import Series

    if not should_reduce:
        EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
        r = None
        try:
            r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
        except Exception:
            pass

        if r is not None:
            should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)

    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
```

In the corrected code, we capture the result of applying the function to the empty series and check its type directly. If the result is not `None`, we infer whether to reduce the result based on its type. This approach should address the bug cases and improve the accuracy of the function's logic.
