The issue seems to be related to the behavior of the `nunique` function for empty dataframes, and also for the `prod` aggregation. The error messages show differences in the values returned which are inconsistent with what is expected.

The problematic function is `apply_empty_result` in the `FrameApply` class. This function is designed to handle cases where an empty result is obtained after applying a function to an empty series in order to see if this is a reduction function.

The root cause of the bug is that in the `apply_empty_result` function, there's a check for `should_reduce` using the result type and the type of the value obtained from applying the function to an empty series. This logic is causing inconsistent behavior because of the check for `should_reduce`.

To resolve the issue, you can:
1. Simplify the logic in the `should_reduce` block to ensure that it correctly determines whether the function is a reduction function or not based on the result obtained.
2. Update the return statement based on the logic to handle the cases where the function result is a Series or a single value.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply_empty_result` function:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    if self.result_type and self.result_type.lower() == "reduce":
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        if callable(self.f):
            EMPTY_SERIES = Series([], dtype=float)
            r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
            if isinstance(r, Series):
                return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
            else:
                return self.obj.copy()
        else:
            return self.obj.copy()
```

This corrected code streamlines the logic and uses the correct conditionals to handle the cases where the function is a reduction function and also whether the result is a Series or a single value.
