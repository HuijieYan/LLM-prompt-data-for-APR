# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
DataFrame.nunique and Series.nunique not consistent when Empty
```

## The associated detailed issue description
```text
Code Sample, a copy-pastable example if possible
Example A:

>>> import pandas as pd
>>> df = pd.DataFrame({"a": [1, 2], "b": [3, 4], "c": [5, 6]})
>>> assert df.nunique().tolist() == [df[col].nunique() for col in df.columns]
# Both equal [2, 2, 2]
Example B:

>>> df = pd.DataFrame(columns=['a', 'b', 'c'])
>>> df.nunique()
# Empty DataFrame
# Columns: [a, b, c]
# Index: []

>>> [df[col].nunique() for col in df.columns]
# [0, 0, 0]
Problem description
In Example A, when a DataFrame isn't empty, getting nunique is consistent between the DataFrame and Series approaches; however, when a DataFrame is empty (Example B), DataFrame.nunique returns itself, while the Series approach returns 0.

Expected Output
I would expect df.nunique to return 0 for each column, consistent with how a Series behaves. An empty object, by definition, has 0 unique elements in my mind.

DataFrame.nunique is incorrect for DataFrame with no columns

(edit by @TomAugspurger)

Current output:

In [33]: pd.DataFrame(index=[0, 1]).nunique()
Out[33]:
Empty DataFrame
Columns: []
Index: [0, 1]
Expected Output is an empty series:

Out[34]: Series([], dtype: float64)
Not sure what the expected dtype of that Series should be... probably object.

original post below:

Code Sample, a copy-pastable example if possible
With Pandas 0.20.3

# create a DataFrame with 3 rows
df = pd.DataFrame({'a': ['A','B','C']})

# lookup unique values for each column, excluding 'a'
unique = df.loc[:, (df.columns != 'a')].nunique()
# this results in an empty Series, the index is also empty
unique.index.tolist()
>>> []
# and
unique[unique == 1].index.tolist()
>>> []
With pandas 0.23.3

# create a DataFrame with 3 rows
df = pd.DataFrame({'a': ['A','B','C']})

# lookup unique values for each column, excluding 'a'
unique = df.loc[:, (df.columns != 'a')].nunique()
# this results in an empty Series, but the index is not empty
unique.index.tolist()
>>> [1,2,3]
also:
unique[unique == 1].index.tolist()
>>> [1,2,3]
Note:

# if we have don't have an empty df, the behavior of nunique() seems fine:
df = pd.DataFrame({'a': ['A','B','C'], 'b': [1,1,1]})
unique = df.loc[:, (df.columns != 'a')].nunique()

unique[unique == 1]
>>> b    1
>>> dtype: int64
# and
unique[unique == 1].index.tolist()
>>> ['b']
Problem description
The change of behavior is a bit disturbing, and seems like it is a bug:
nunique() ends up creating a Series, and it should be a Series of the df columns, but that doesn't seem to be the case here, instead it is picking up the index of the df.

This is likely related to:

#21932
#21255

I am posting this because in my use case I use the list to drop the columns, but i end up with column names that do not exist in the df
```
