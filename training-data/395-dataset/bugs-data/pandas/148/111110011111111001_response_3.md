The bug seems to be originating from the `apply_empty_result` method within the `FrameApply` class. The function is trying to determine if it needs to reduce an empty DataFrame, however, the logic for this determination seems to be flawed, which is causing the test cases to fail.

The bug seems to stem from the incorrect handling of reduction for empty DataFrames and the specific reduction functions. This leads to incorrect results and mismatches with the expected outputs.

To fix the bug, the code should be adjusted to correctly handle reduction for empty DataFrames and the specific reduction functions. The logic should consider the conditions under which the DataFrame is empty and apply reduction functions accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply_empty_result` method:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """
    
    # If the DataFrame is empty, apply reduction functions
    if self.obj.empty:
        # Check if the function is a reduction function
        if self.result_type == "reduce":
            return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
        else:
            # Non-reduction function, just return a copy of the existing object
            return self.obj.copy()
    else:
        # DataFrame is not empty, return a copy of the existing object
        return self.obj.copy()
```

With this corrected code, the function should correctly handle reduction and non-reduction functions for empty DataFrames, and pass the test cases without errors.
