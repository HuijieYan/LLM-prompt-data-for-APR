The error in the `apply_empty_result` function seems to be related to the logic for handling reduction functions when the result is empty. The function is intended to apply a function to an empty DataFrame to check if it's a reduction function, and if so, return the appropriate result.

Looking at the error messages, it appears that the function is not handling reduction functions properly for empty results. The function is expecting different types of results than it is actually getting, leading to assertion errors in the test functions.

The bug seems to stem from the logic for inferring reduction. The conditional statements and the handling of the `should_reduce` variable are not working as intended.

To fix the bug, the logic for inferring reduction should be revised to handle reduction functions correctly. Additionally, the handling of the `r` variable and the checks for the type of result should be adjusted to ensure the correct result is being returned.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply_empty_result` function:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0
    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    # we may need to infer
    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    if not should_reduce:
        from pandas import Series
        EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
        r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
        
        if isinstance(r, Series):
            should_reduce = False
        else:
            should_reduce = True

    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
```

In the corrected version:
- The inference of reduction has been simplified and corrected to handle reduction functions properly.
- The handling of the result type has been adjusted to ensure the correct result is returned based on whether the function is a reduction function or not.
