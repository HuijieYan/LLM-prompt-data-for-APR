Based on the given test cases, it seems that the bug is likely due to the use of an empty `Series` and the handling of the `should_reduce` variable. 

In the buggy function, there are issues with handling the `should_reduce` variable and the use of an empty `Series`. The `should_reduce` variable is not consistently updated based on the conditions. Additionally, the `EMPTY_SERIES` assignment should be a correctly instantiated empty Series.

One approach to fixing the bug is to consistently update the `should_reduce` variable and initialize the `EMPTY_SERIES` correctly as an empty Series.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    # we may need to infer
    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    if not should_reduce:
        from pandas import Series
        EMPTY_SERIES = Series([], dtype=float)
        try:
            r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
            should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)
        except Exception:
            should_reduce = False

    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
```

In the corrected code:
- The `should_reduce` variable is consistently updated based on the conditions.
- The `EMPTY_SERIES` is correctly instantiated as an empty Series with a float dtype.
