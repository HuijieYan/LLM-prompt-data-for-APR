The error indicates that the behavior of `DataFrame.nunique` is inconsistent when the DataFrame is empty compared to when it has non-empty columns. The function is returning an empty DataFrame instead of an empty Series, leading to discrepancies in behavior when operated upon further.

The potential error appears to be in the `apply_empty_result` method of the related file `pandas/core/apply.py`. This is due to the function not returning a Series when the DataFrame is empty, causing inconsistencies in behavior in the `nunique` function.

The reason behind the bug is that the condition when the DataFrame is empty is not handled correctly in the `apply_empty_result` function. When an empty DataFrame is encountered, the function should return an empty Series, but it returns an empty DataFrame instead.

One possible approach to fixing this bug is to modify the `apply_empty_result` method to handle cases where an empty DataFrame is encountered. We should ensure that when an empty DataFrame is detected, the function returns an empty Series instead of an empty DataFrame, thereby preserving consistency in the behavior of the `nunique` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply_empty_result` method:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0
    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    # we may need to infer
    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    from pandas import Series

    if not should_reduce:

        EMPTY_SERIES = Series([], index=pd.Index([]))
        try:
            r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
        except Exception:
            pass
        else:
            should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)

    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return Series([], index=pd.Index([]))
```

The corrected implementation should resolve the issue by ensuring that when an empty DataFrame is encountered, the function returns an empty Series with an empty index, maintaining consistency and resolving discrepancies in the behavior of the `nunique` function.
