Potential error location: The error occurs when trying to apply the function to an empty series and checking if it is a reduction function.

Reason for the bug: The function is not handling the case where it should reduce the series correctly.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We can refactor the logic for handling reduction and non-reduction cases and simplify the code to make it more readable and maintainable.

Corrected code:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    from pandas import Series

    if not should_reduce:
        EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
        try:
            r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
        except Exception:
            pass
        else:
            should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)

    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
```
