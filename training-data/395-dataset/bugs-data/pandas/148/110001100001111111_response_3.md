The bug in the `apply_empty_result` method is likely due to the `should_reduce` variable not being set correctly according to the logic provided in the function. The method is supposed to determine whether the result should be reduced based on the input values and the result type. However, the logic used to determine `should_reduce` seems to be problematic.

The correct approach to fixing this bug would be to carefully review the logic for determining whether the result should be reduced or not, and then adjust the subsequent code accordingly.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    from pandas import Series
    EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
    if self.result_type == "reduce":
        try:
            r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
        except Exception:
            pass
        else:
            return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)

    return self.obj.copy()
```

This corrected function removes the problematic logic used to determine `should_reduce` and replaces it with an approach based on the `result_type`. It also makes the code cleaner and more readable.
