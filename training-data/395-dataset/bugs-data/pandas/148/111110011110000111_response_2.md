The issue seems to be related to the inconsistencies between DataFrame.nunique() and Series.nunique() when dealing with empty DataFrames. The expected output is an empty Series with a dtype of float64, whereas the DataFrame.nunique() is returning an empty DataFrame with index [0, 1], which is not consistent with the behavior of Series.nunique().

The potential error location within the buggy function is likely in the `apply_empty_result` method. The problem seems to be related to the type of the returned object. The DataFrame is expected to return a Series when nunique is applied to it, but the buggy code is returning an empty DataFrame in some cases.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug are related to the inconsistent handling of empty DataFrames in the `apply_empty_result`. When applying nunique to an empty DataFrame, it should return an empty Series, but the buggy code is returning an empty DataFrame instead.

To fix the bug, it will be necessary to modify the `apply_empty_result` function to ensure that it returns an empty Series with the appropriate dtype when nunique is applied to an empty DataFrame. This will make the behavior consistent with the Series.nunique() method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    # we may need to infer
    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    from pandas import Series

    if not should_reduce:
        EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
        try:
            r = getattr(EMPTY_SERIES, self.f)(*self.args, **self.kwds)
        except Exception:
            pass
        else:
            should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)

    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
```

By modifying the code to use the `getattr` function to apply the function `self.f` to `EMPTY_SERIES` and returning the appropriate result, the bug should be fixed. This will ensure that an empty Series is returned when nunique is applied to an empty DataFrame, providing a consistent behavior with the Series.nunique() method.
