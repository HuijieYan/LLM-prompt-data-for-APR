The issue mentioned here is related to the behavior of the `nunique` method in Pandas when dealing with an empty DataFrame. The reported behavior is inconsistent with the expectations when working with an empty DataFrame in terms of uniqueness.

Upon initial analysis, it seems that the buggy function `apply_empty_result` is returns unexpected results when executing the specified logic for an empty result. This may be the root cause of the issue.

The reason for the bug could be that the logic for handling an empty DataFrame is not correctly implemented, resulting in unexpected behavior when returning the result.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic in the `apply_empty_result` function to correctly handle an empty DataFrame and return the expected results.

Here is the corrected code for the `apply_empty_result` function:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    # we may need to infer
    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"
    r = None

    from pandas import Series

    if not should_reduce:

        EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
        r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)

    if r is not None and not isinstance(r, Series):
        should_reduce = True

    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
```

In the corrected code, the logic for handling the result of applying the function to an empty series has been modified to correctly infer the reduction and return the expected results.
