Potential error location: The error may be occurring in the `if not should_reduce:` block of code.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug may be caused by the incorrect handling of the `should_reduce` variable and its condition. This part of the code is responsible for determining whether to reduce or infer reduction based on the result obtained from applying the function to an empty series.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Modify the condition for the `should_reduce` variable to accurately determine if reduction needs to be performed based on the result obtained.
- Ensure that the `self.f` function receives the correct arguments (EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds) and that the result is checked properly.

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    # we may need to infer
    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    from pandas import Series
    import numpy as np

    if not should_reduce:
        EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
        r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)

        should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)

    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
