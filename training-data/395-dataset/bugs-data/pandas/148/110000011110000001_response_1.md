The test case is designed to test various aggregate functions (`sum`, `prod`, `any`, `all`) applied to an empty DataFrame. The error messages indicate that the test results are not matching the expected results.

The issue is likely originating from the `apply_empty_result` function, as it is called when applying aggregation functions to the empty DataFrame.

The `apply_empty_result` function is designed to handle the case of applying aggregation functions to an empty DataFrame. However, it currently has several issues:
1. It checks for `self.result_type` to decide whether to return a copy of the DataFrame, but this might not be handling all relevant cases correctly.
2. The handling of the `EMPTY_SERIES` is flawed. It incorrectly checks for a reduction function (`should_reduce`) based on the result of applying the function `self.f` to an empty series.

To fix the function, the following changes should be made:
1. Remove the check for `self.result_type` and instead rely on the behavior of the function applied to the empty DataFrame.
2. Refactor the handling of the `EMPTY_SERIES` to better infer whether a reduction should occur based on the result of applying `self.f` to the empty series.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply_empty_result` function:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # we need to infer whether to reduce
    from pandas import Series

    EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])

    should_reduce = True

    try:
        r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
    except Exception:
        pass
    else:
        should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)

    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
```

With these changes, the function should be able to correctly determine whether to apply reduction based on the result of applying the function to the empty series. Upon making these changes, the test cases should pass without errors.
