The bug is related to the behavior of the `nunique` function in pandas. When the DataFrame is empty, the behavior of `nunique` is inconsistent with how a Series behaves.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `apply_empty_result` method where it checks if the result_type is not "reduce" and returns a copy of the existing object. This is inconsistent and results in unexpected behavior.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the method `apply_empty_result` is not handling the case of an empty DataFrame properly, resulting in inconsistent behavior with Series methods.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic in the `apply_empty_result` method to handle the case of an empty DataFrame by returning an empty Series with the appropriate dtype.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply_empty_result` method:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # Check if the result_type is not "reduce" or None
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    # Get the data type of the DataFrame
    dtype = self.obj._get_cacher(dtype=self.result_type).dtype

    # Return an empty Series with the appropriate dtype
    return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis, dtype=dtype)
```

With this correction, the `apply_empty_result` method will now return an empty Series with the appropriate dtype when the DataFrame is empty, which is consistent with the behavior of a Series.
