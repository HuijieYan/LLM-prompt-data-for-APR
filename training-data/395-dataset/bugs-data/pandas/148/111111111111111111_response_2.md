The problem is occurring when calling the `nunique` method on an empty DataFrame, which returns an incorrect result compared to the behavior of `nunique` for non-empty DataFrames.

The issue arises from the implementation of the `apply_empty_result` method in the `FrameApply` class, which is adjusting the behavior for empty results and causing inconsistency. 

To fix the problem, the adjustments made in the `apply_empty_result` method should be reviewed and corrected to ensure that the produced result is consistent with expectations and the behavior seen in other methods of DataFrame. 

The corrected code for the `apply_empty_result` function is as follows:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    We have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0
    
    We will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """
    
    # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()
    
    # we may need to infer
    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"
    
    from pandas import Series
    
    if not should_reduce:
    
        EMPTY_SERIES = Series([], dtype=float)
        try:
            r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
        except Exception:
            pass
        else:
            should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)
    
    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
```

The adjustments to the code include specifying the dtype for the `EMPTY_SERIES` as `float`, and handling the operation applied to the empty series properly. After making these corrections, the `nunique` method should produce the expected results consistent with the behavior of other DataFrame methods.
