Potential error location: 
The potential error in the code is in the `apply_empty_result` function. The code is trying to check if the result should be reduced or not, and if not, it attempts to call the function `f` with an empty Series. However, the function `f` is not defined in the class `FrameApply`, and it should be accessed through `self.f` instead.

Reason for the bug:
The code is trying to call the function `f` directly, but it should be accessed through `self.f`.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the function `f` is called using `self.f` to access the function defined in the class.

Corrected code:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    # we may need to infer
    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    from pandas import Series
    if not should_reduce:
        EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
        try:
            r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)  # Changed from f to self.f
        except Exception:
            pass
        else:
            should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)

    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
```
