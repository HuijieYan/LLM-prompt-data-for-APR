The bug in the function `apply_empty_result` is occurring due to the incorrect handling of the `should_reduce` variable. The variable `should_reduce` is being initialized based on the `self.result_type` but then re-evaluated based on the result of a function applied to an empty series. This leads to inconsistent behavior and incorrect reduction.

One approach to fixing the bug is to remove the re-evaluation of `should_reduce` based on the result of the function. Instead, it can be directly initialized based on `self.result_type`. Additionally, the function application to an empty series can be modified to return an empty series of the correct data type, rather than using exception handling.

Here's the corrected `apply_empty_result` function:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    # we may need to infer
    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
```

This corrected function directly initializes `should_reduce` based on `self.result_type`.

Additionally, the function application to an empty series has been removed to ensure consistent behavior and the function returns an empty series of the correct data type as expected.
