The issue is occurring in the `apply_empty_result` function which is responsible for handling empty results and is causing inconsistencies with expected behavior.

The error messages indicate that the function is returning incorrect results or an empty DataFrame when the expected output should be a Series containing zeros. This inconsistency is affecting multiple test cases, as described in the error messages and associated GitHub issues.

The reason behind this bug is likely due to incorrect handling of empty results. Since the function is expected to handle empty results by returning a Series of zeros, the current implementation is not consistent with this expectation.

To fix this bug, the `apply_empty_result` function needs to be modified to ensure that it correctly handles empty results by returning a Series of zeros when needed. Additionally, the function should be refactored to ensure that it aligns with the behavior expected in the test cases and GitHub issues described above.

Here's the corrected `apply_empty_result` function:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    from pandas import Series

    if not should_reduce:
        EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
        try:
            r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
        except Exception:
            pass
        else:
            if isinstance(r, (pd.Series, pd.DataFrame)):
                return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    
    return self.obj._constructor_sliced(0, index=self.agg_axis)
```

This corrected code checks if the result should be reduced based on the `result_type`. It also handles the calculation and return of the correct expected result - a Series containing zeros when needed.

By applying these changes, the function should now produce the expected results and resolve the inconsistencies experienced in the test cases and GitHub issues.
