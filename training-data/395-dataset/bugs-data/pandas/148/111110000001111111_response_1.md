The buggy function `apply_empty_result` is used as part of a class `FrameApply` and is expected to return the appropriate result based on the `result_type`. However, there are some inconsistencies in the behavior of the function, particularly when dealing with an empty DataFrame. It appears that the conditional checks for `should_reduce` might not be accurately reflecting the expected behavior when the DataFrame is empty.

It seems the bug is occurring due to an issue with the conditional checks and the handling of the `should_reduce` flag. The function should be modified to better handle the case of an empty DataFrame and ensure that the behavior is consistent with the expectations based on the input parameters.

To fix the bug, it is recommended to update the conditional checks and possibly reconsider the overall logic within the function. Additionally, it might be necessary to review the behavior of the function in relation to the `result_type` and its impact on the expected output.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply_empty_result` function:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    from pandas import Series
    EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])

    # we may need to infer
    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"
    if not should_reduce:
        try:
            r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
        except Exception:
            pass
        else:
            should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)

    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
```

In the corrected code, the conditional checks for `should_reduce` are simplified and improved to accurately reflect the intended logic. This updated version should resolve the inconsistency and address the bug in the `apply_empty_result` function while maintaining the expected behavior for different input scenarios.
