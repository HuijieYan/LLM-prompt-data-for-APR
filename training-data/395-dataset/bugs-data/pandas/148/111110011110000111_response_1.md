The problem that causes the following test errors and the associated GitHub issues is due to the inconsistent behavior of the `nunique` function when working with an empty DataFrame. The issue is also observed in the `apply` methods for functions such as `sum`, `prod`, `any`, and `all` when applied over an empty DataFrame, as demonstrated in the error messages provided.

The root cause of the bug is the inconsistent behavior of the `nunique` function when working with an empty DataFrame. The expected result is to return an empty Series with a dtype of `int64`, but instead, an Empty DataFrame is being returned.

A potential approach to fix the bug is to modify the `apply_empty_result` method of the `FrameApply` class to handle the case when an empty DataFrame is encountered. This can be achieved by explicitly checking for an empty DataFrame and returning the expected behavior as mentioned in the GitHub issues.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply_empty_result` method:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0
    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    # we may need to infer
    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    from pandas import Series

    if self.obj.empty:
        return Series([])  # Return an empty Series

    if not should_reduce:
        EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
        try:
            r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
        except Exception:
            pass
        else:
            should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)

    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
```

By adding the check `if self.obj.empty`, the method now explicitly handles the case of an empty DataFrame, returning an empty Series. This aligns with the expected behavior and resolves the bug.

This fix will ensure that the `apply` methods and operations like `nunique` consistently handle empty DataFrames, addressing the issues mentioned in the GitHub bug reports and resolving the associated test errors.
