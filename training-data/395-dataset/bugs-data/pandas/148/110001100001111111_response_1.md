The issue is related to the `apply_empty_result` method of a pandas DataFrame. The method is not behaving consistently when the DataFrame is empty. The expected behavior is for the method to return an empty Series for consistency with the behavior of Series.

The issue seems to be in the logic to determine whether the result should be reduced or not. The method should check if the result is being reduced, and if not, an empty Series should be returned. However, the code is not handling this logic correctly, resulting in inconsistent behavior.

To fix this issue, the method should be modified to always return an empty Series when the DataFrame is empty.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply_empty_result` method:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    # always return an empty Series for consistency with Series behavior
    from pandas import Series
    return Series([], index=self.agg_axis)

```
