Potential Error Location: The bug seems to be in the logic for handling the empty result in the function `apply_empty_result`.

Reason for Bug: The bug occurs because the logic for handling the empty result is not correctly identifying whether the function should reduce the data or not.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug: We need to modify the logic for determining whether the function should reduce the data or not, and handle the empty result accordingly.

Corrected Code:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    # we may need to infer
    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    from pandas import Series
    import numpy as np

    if not should_reduce:
        EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
        try:
            r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
        except Exception:
            pass
        else:
            should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)

    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
```
In the corrected code, we have added the `import numpy as np` statement to resolve the reference to `np.nan`. We have also retained the original logic while fixing the bug by correctly determining whether the function should reduce the data or not.
