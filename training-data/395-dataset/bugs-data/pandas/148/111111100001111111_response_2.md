This function is supposed to apply a function to an empty series in order to determine if it is a reduction function. There are several issues with this function, and we should start by correcting the issues and optimizing the function.

Issues:
1. The condition `self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]` is incorrect and should be `if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:` instead of `if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:`
2. The logic for checking whether to reduce is incorrect, and it would be better to use `if not should_reduce:` instead of `if not should_reduce:`
3. The r value should be initialized to None, because in some cases it is an exception being omitted, but the variable is not defined before

The function also has a number of conditional blocks that make it hard to read. We can address this by simplifying the logic in the function.


```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    # we may need to infer
    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    import numpy as np

    if not should_reduce:
        EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
        try:
            r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
        except Exception:
            r = None
        else:
            should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)

    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()

```
We simplified the `if` statements and used a `try` and `except` block to handle the exception correctly. We also initialized the value of r with None to avoid any potential issues.
