The potential error in the function is that it is not handling the case when the result_type is None properly. It should return a copy of the existing object in this case.

The reason for the bug is that the function is not correctly handling the case when the result_type is None. It is only checking for "reduce" but not for None.

To fix the bug, we should add a check for None in the if condition and return a copy of the existing object in that case.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    # we may need to infer
    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    from pandas import Series

    if not should_reduce or self.result_type is None:  # added check for None
        return self.obj.copy()  # return a copy of the existing object

    EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
    try:
        r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
    except Exception:
        pass
    else:
        should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)

    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
```
