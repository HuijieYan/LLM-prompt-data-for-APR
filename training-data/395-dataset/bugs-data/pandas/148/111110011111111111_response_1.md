The bug seems to be related to the behavior of the `apply_empty_result` method in the `FrameApply` class. The method attempts to handle empty results and apply a specific function to an empty series, but it does not seem to be returning the expected values.

Upon analysis, it appears that the buggy function uses the `should_reduce` variable to determine whether it should reduce the result. However, the logic within the function seems to be incorrect, leading to incorrect return values and ultimately causing the test cases to fail.

The primary reason for this bug seems to be incorrect handling of the `should_reduce` variable and its interaction with the result of applying the function to an empty series.

One possible approach for fixing this bug could be to review the logic for determining whether to reduce the result. Additionally, you may need to review the handling of the result obtained from applying the function to an empty series and validate whether it needs to be reduced or not.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply_empty_result` method:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    # we may need to infer
    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    from pandas import Series

    if not should_reduce:

        EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
        try:
            r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
        except Exception:
            pass
        else:
            should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)
    
    if should_reduce:
        # If the result should be reduced, return a zero-filled series with the same index
        return Series(0, index=self.obj.columns)
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
```

This corrected code introduces changes to the logic for determining whether the result should be reduced. It also explicitly handles the case where the result should be reduced by returning a zero-filled series with the same index as the original DataFrame.
