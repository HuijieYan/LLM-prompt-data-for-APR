The `apply_empty_result` function seems to be causing the error in the test case. The error messages indicate that the function is returning unexpected results when called with certain aggregation functions such as "sum", "prod", "any", and "all".

The reason behind the bug is that the `apply_empty_result` function is not handling empty DataFrames or Series correctly. When the DataFrame is empty, the function should return the expected result for common aggregation functions.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `apply_empty_result` function to correctly handle empty DataFrames or Series for aggregation functions such as "sum", "prod", "any", and "all".

Here's the corrected code for the `apply_empty_result` function:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    # we may need to infer
    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    if not should_reduce:
        try:
            r = getattr(self.obj, self.agg_axis)()
        except Exception:
            pass
        else:
            should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)

    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
```

With this modification, the `apply_empty_result` function should now correctly handle empty DataFrames and return expected results for common aggregation functions like "sum" and "prod".
