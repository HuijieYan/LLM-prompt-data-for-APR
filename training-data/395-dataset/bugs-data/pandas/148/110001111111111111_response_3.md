The issue seems to be related to the `DataFrame.nunique()` method returning an empty DataFrame instead of an empty Series when the DataFrame is empty.

Potential bug location:
The issue might be with the `apply_empty_result` function, specifically in the section where it tries to apply the function to an empty series to see if it is a reduction function.

Reasons behind the bug:
The bug might be occurring due to incorrect handling of empty DataFrames in the `apply_empty_result` method. It appears that the function is returning an empty DataFrame instead of an empty Series when the DataFrame is empty.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `apply_empty_result` method to return an empty Series instead of an empty DataFrame when the DataFrame is empty.
2. Verify the conditions and comparisons in the `apply_empty_result` method to ensure the correct value type is returned.
3. Make sure that the method returns the expected variable value and type as per the defined test cases.

Corrected code for the `apply_empty_result` method:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    # we may need to infer
    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    from pandas import Series

    if not should_reduce:
        EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
        try:
            r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
        except Exception:
            pass
        else:
            should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)

    if should_reduce:
        return EMPTY_SERIES
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
```

With this correction, the `apply_empty_result` method will return an empty Series when the DataFrame is empty, making it consistent with the expected behavior and resolving the test failures and the reported issues.
