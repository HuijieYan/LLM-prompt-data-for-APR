Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is in the section where the function tries to apply the function to an empty series to see if it is a reduction function.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the logic for checking if the function is a reduction function and handling the empty series is not implemented correctly.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the result type is "reduce" and return the appropriate result based on that.
2. Handle the case where the function is applied to an empty series and infer if it is a reduction function based on the result.

Corrected Code:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    if self.result_type in ["reduce", None]:
        try:
            EMPTY_SERIES = self.obj._constructor_sliced([], index=self.agg_axis)
            r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
            if isinstance(r, Series):
                return self.obj.copy()
        except Exception:
            pass
    return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
```
