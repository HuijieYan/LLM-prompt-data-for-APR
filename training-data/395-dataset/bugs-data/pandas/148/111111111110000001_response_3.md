The `apply_empty_result` function is attempting to handle the case where the result is empty and at least one axis is 0. The function is trying to infer if the function is a reduction function and whether the result should be reduced or not before returning a copy of the existing object. The bug is likely related to the handling of reduction functions and the type of result that it is expecting.

The error messages from the test function show that the Series or DataFrame expected from applying the functions "sum", "prod", "any", and "all" are different from the expected results, possibly due to incorrect handling of the reduction function.

To fix the bug, we need to properly determine if the given function is a reduction function and handle the result accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply_empty_result` function:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    # we may need to infer
    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    if not should_reduce:
        EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
        try:
            r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
        except Exception:
            return self.obj.copy()  # return a copy of the existing object on failure
        else:
            should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)

    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
```

In this corrected code, we have added a more robust handling to the code segment that attempts to infer if the given function is a reduction function. We return a copy of the existing object when the function fails to infer whether it is a reduction function. This should address the issues seen in the test cases.
