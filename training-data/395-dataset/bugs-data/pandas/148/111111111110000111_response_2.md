The bug is related to the `apply_empty_result` method, which is returning an empty DataFrame instead of an empty Series. This is causing errors in the test cases, as they are expecting empty Series instead of empty DataFrames under certain conditions.

The reason behind the bug is that the `apply_empty_result` method is returning a DataFrame with empty columns and index when it should return an empty Series instead. This inconsistency is causing the test cases to fail.

To fix this bug, the `apply_empty_result` method should be modified to return an empty Series instead of an empty DataFrame when the result is empty.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply_empty_result` method:

```python
class FrameApply():
    # ... other methods ...

    def apply_empty_result(self):
        """
        we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0
    
        we will try to apply the function to an empty
        series in order to see if this is a reduction function
        """
    
        # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
        # so just return a copy of the existing object
        if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
            return self.obj.copy()
        
        # we may need to infer
        should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"
        from pandas import Series
        
        if not should_reduce:
            EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
            try:
                r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
            except Exception:
                pass
            else:
                should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)
            
        if should_reduce:
            return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
        else:
            # Return an empty Series instead of an empty DataFrame
            return EMPTY_SERIES
```

With this correction, the `apply_empty_result` method now returns an empty Series when the condition is met, ensuring consistency with the expected results in the test cases.
