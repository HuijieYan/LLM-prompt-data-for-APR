Potential error location: The current implementation of the function `apply_empty_result` has a bug that causes it to return the wrong result or encounter various assertion errors when used in the test cases.

Reasons behind the bug occurrence:
1. The function is not handling empty DataFrames correctly.
2. The function is not properly checking for reduction or inference of reduction functions, leading to incorrect returns or assertion errors.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the DataFrame is empty and handle it accordingly.
2. Ensure that the function correctly handles reduction or inference of reduction functions.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    # we may need to infer
    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    from pandas import Series

    if self.obj.empty:
        if should_reduce:
            return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
        else:
            return self.obj.copy()

    EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
    try:
        r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
    except Exception:  # handle the specific exception to catch
        pass
    else:
        if isinstance(r, Series):
            should_reduce = False
        else:
            should_reduce = True

    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
