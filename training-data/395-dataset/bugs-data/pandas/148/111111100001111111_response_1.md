The issue seems to be with the `apply_empty_result` method of the `FrameApply` class. The method is supposed to return an empty result when at least one axis is 0, but it is not handling the reduction of an empty DataFrame correctly, leading to inconsistent results.

The bug occurs because the method `apply_empty_result` is not handling the case of reduction for an empty DataFrame properly. It should return an empty Series when the DataFrame is empty, but it currently does not do that, leading to inconsistent behavior.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `apply_empty_result` method to handle the reduction of an empty DataFrame correctly.

Here is the corrected code for the `apply_empty_result` method:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    if not should_reduce:
        from pandas import Series
        empty_series = Series([])
        r = self.f(empty_series, *self.args, **self.kwds)
        should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)

    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis).iloc[0:0]
```

This corrected code will properly handle the reduction of an empty DataFrame and return an empty Series in the case of reduction.
