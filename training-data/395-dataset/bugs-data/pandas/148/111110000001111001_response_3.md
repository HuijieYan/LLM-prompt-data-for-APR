The buggy function `apply_empty_result` has an issue related to an incorrect condition checking and exception handling.

In this function, the `should_reduce` variable is set to `True` initially. Then, if `should_reduce` is not `True`, an empty series `EMPTY_SERIES` is created and an attempt to apply the function `self.f` is made. If an exception is raised, the code continues without doing anything. If no exception is raised, then it checks if the result is not an instance of Series and sets `should_reduce` accordingly.

The bug occurs when setting `should_reduce` to `True` initially before checking the function result. As a result, if the function result is actually a Series, `should_reduce` will remain `True`.

To fix this bug, we can change the initial value of `should_reduce` to `False` and modify the logic accordingly to set it to `True` only if the result is not an instance of Series.

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    should_reduce = False  # Changed initial value to False
    from pandas import Series

    if not should_reduce:
        EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
        try:
            r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
        except Exception:
            pass
        else:
            should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)

    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
```

With this change, the `should_reduce` variable will be correctly updated based on the result of applying the function to the empty series.
