The issue occurs because the `apply_empty_result` function is not handling the case of an empty DataFrame properly. In the case of an empty result, the function tries to apply the given function to an empty series, but it does not correctly handle the case where the result should be a reduction function.

To fix this issue, we can modify the approach within the `apply_empty_result` function to address the specific cases of an empty result.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply_empty_result` function:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    We have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0.
    
    We will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function.
    """
    
    # Copy the existing object if there is no reduction or inference needed
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()
    
    # Check if we need to infer reduction
    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"
    
    from pandas import Series
    
    if not should_reduce:
        # Create an empty series
        EMPTY_SERIES = Series([], dtype='float64')
        try:
            r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
        except Exception:
            pass
        else:
            should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)
    
    if should_reduce:
        # Return a new Series
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        # Otherwise, return a copy of the existing object
        return self.obj.copy()
```

In the corrected code:
- We ensure that an empty series created for testing should have the correct data type (`dtype='float64'`) to match the expected behavior.
- The `should_reduce` logic is modified to correctly check for a reduction function.
- Depending on whether the function is identified as a reduction function or not, the appropriate object is returned.

By making these changes, the `apply_empty_result` function should handle the cases of empty DataFrames and empty results more effectively, addressing the issues found in the provided test scenarios.
