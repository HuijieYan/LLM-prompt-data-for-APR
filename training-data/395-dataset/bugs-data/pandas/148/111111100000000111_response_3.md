Analyzing the test cases, it appears that when a DataFrame is empty, the `nunique` function is returning an empty DataFrame instead of an empty Series. This behavior is inconsistent with how a Series behaves and leads to incorrect results.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the logic that determines the result when the DataFrame is empty.

The bug occurs because when the DataFrame is empty, the function returns an empty DataFrame instead of an empty Series. This inconsistency leads to unexpected behavior and incorrect results.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the function to return an empty Series when the DataFrame is empty, in line with the behavior of a Series. This will ensure consistency and correct results in all scenarios.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    # we may need to infer
    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    from pandas import Series

    if not should_reduce:
        EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
        try:
            r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
        except Exception:
            pass
        else:
            should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)

    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return Series([])  # Return an empty Series when the DataFrame is empty
```
