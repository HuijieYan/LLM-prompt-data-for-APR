The error occurs because the function `apply_empty_result` does not return the expected result. This is likely due to the logic inside the function that handles empty results.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for handling an empty result when applying a function to an empty series.

The function is not correctly handling the case when the result is empty. It does not properly return an empty series when needed.

To fix the bug, the function logic should be updated to handle the case when the result is empty. The function should return an empty series when needed, and it should properly infer reduction when necessary.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    # we may need to infer
    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    from pandas import Series

    if not should_reduce:
        EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
        try:
            r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
            should_reduce = np.isscalar(r)  # check if the result is a scalar
        except Exception:
            pass
        
    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
```

In the corrected code, the logic for handling the empty result has been updated to properly handle cases where there is no result or when the result is a scalar. This should address the issues in the test cases and ensure the function behaves as expected.
