The issue with the given function is that it is trying to handle empty series and infer whether the result should be reduced or not, but it is not doing it correctly. There are also some inconsistencies between the bug causes and the remedy. 

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    # we may need to infer
    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    if not should_reduce:
        EMPTY_SERIES = pd.Series([], dtype=float)
        try:
            r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
        except Exception:
            pass
        else:
            should_reduce = not isinstance(r, pd.Series)

    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
```

In this corrected function, we have made the following changes:

1. Used `pd.Series([])` to create an empty series since this is the conventional way of creating an empty Series in pandas.
2. Used `pd.Series([], dtype=float)` to explicitly specify the data type of the empty series as float.
3. Modified the object instantiation to `self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)` to handle the case when a reduction is needed.
