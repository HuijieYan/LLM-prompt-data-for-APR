The issue arises because when an empty DataFrame is used with the `nunique` function, it does not return an empty Series as expected. Instead, it returns an empty DataFrame in the case of an empty DataFrame. This behavior is not consistent with how a Series behaves.

To fix the bug, the `apply_empty_result` function in the `FrameApply` class needs to be updated. Specifically, the function should return an empty Series when the input DataFrame is empty.

Below is the corrected code for the `apply_empty_result` function:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    # we may need to infer
    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    from pandas import Series

    # Corrected code to return an empty Series
    if not should_reduce:
        EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
        return EMPTY_SERIES
```

With this correction, the `apply_empty_result` function will correctly return an empty Series when the input DataFrame is empty, consistent with the behavior of a Series.
