The `apply_empty_result` function has an issue with the way it handles empty series when dealing with reduction functions. When an empty DataFrame is encountered, the code attempts to apply a reduction function, but it fails to handle the empty DataFrame case correctly.

The code should return the correct output when applying a reduction function to an empty DataFrame.

It seems like the issue is with the logic where it tries to apply the function to an empty series and infer if it should reduce based on the result.

A possible approach to fixing the bug is to explicitly check if the DataFrame is empty and return the appropriate result without attempting to apply the function to an empty series. If the DataFrame is empty, return the expected empty Series. If it's not empty, proceed with the normal apply logic.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply_empty_result` function:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """
    
    # Return an empty Series if the DataFrame is empty
    if self.obj.empty:
        return self.obj.iloc[0:0]
    
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    from pandas import Series

    if not should_reduce and not self.obj.empty:
        try:
            r = self.f(self.obj, *self.args, **self.kwds)
        except Exception:
            pass
        else:
            should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)

    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
```

With this correction, the function will return an empty Series if the DataFrame is empty and correctly proceed with the apply logic when the DataFrame is not empty.
