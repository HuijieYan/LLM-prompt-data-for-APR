The bug seems to be in the logic for determining whether the result should be reduced or not. The `should_reduce` variable is being used to infer if the result needs to be reduced, but its value is not being used consistently.

Based on the expected and buggy test cases, the `should_reduce` variable should be properly evaluated based on the input parameters and the type of the result.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    # we may need to infer
    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    from pandas import Series

    # Create an empty series
    EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])

    # Try applying the function to the empty series
    try:
        r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
    except Exception:
        pass
    else:
        # Check the type of the result to infer reduction
        should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)

    # Based on the inferred reduction, return the result
    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
```

In the corrected code:
1. We consistently use the `should_reduce` variable to determine if the result needs to be reduced based on the type of the result.
2. We create an empty series explicitly and apply the function to it to check if the result is a reduction.
3. Based on the inferred reduction, we return the result accordingly.
