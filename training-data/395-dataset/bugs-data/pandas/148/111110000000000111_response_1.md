The bug is in the `apply_empty_result` function of the `FrameApply` class. The function is not behaving as expected when the result_type is not "reduce" or None. It should return a copy of the existing object in this case, but it is not doing so.

The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of the `result_type` and not returning a copy of the existing object when it should.

To fix the bug, we should add a return statement to return a copy of the existing object when the `result_type` is not "reduce" or None.

Here's the corrected code for the `apply_empty_result` function:

```python
def apply_empty_result(self):
    """
    we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0

    we will try to apply the function to an empty
    series in order to see if this is a reduction function
    """

    # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
    # so just return a copy of the existing object
    if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
        return self.obj.copy()

    # we may need to infer
    should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"

    from pandas import Series

    if not should_reduce:

        EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
        try:
            r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
        except Exception:
            pass
        else:
            should_reduce = not isinstance(r, Series)

    if should_reduce:
        return self.obj._constructor_sliced(np.nan, index=self.agg_axis)
    else:
        return self.obj.copy()
```
