Potential error location:
The potential error in the code is that the function `apply_empty_result` is not returning the correct value when the result type is "reduce" or when the result of `self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)` is not an instance of Series. This is causing inconsistencies in behavior when the function is applied to an empty series.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the logic in the `apply_empty_result` function is not correctly handling the cases where the result type is "reduce" or when the result of the function call is not a Series.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the result type is "reduce" and return an empty DataFrame if so. This will make the behavior consistent with the Series approach when an empty DataFrame is encountered.
2. Ensure that the function call `self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)` is correctly handled and return an empty DataFrame if the result is not an instance of Series.

Corrected code:

```python
    def apply_empty_result(self):
        """
        we have an empty result; at least 1 axis is 0
    
        we will try to apply the function to an empty
        series in order to see if this is a reduction function
        """
    
        # we are not asked to reduce or infer reduction
        # so just return a copy of the existing object
        if self.result_type not in ["reduce", None]:
            return self.obj.copy()
    
        # we may need to infer
        should_reduce = self.result_type == "reduce"
    
        from pandas import Series
    
        if not should_reduce:
            EMPTY_SERIES = Series([])
            try:
                r = self.f(EMPTY_SERIES, *self.args, **self.kwds)
            except Exception:
                pass
            else:
                if not isinstance(r, Series):
                    should_reduce = True
    
        if should_reduce:
            return self.obj._constructor(self.obj)
        else:
            return self.obj.copy()
