The error message indicates that the file 'tests/test-generate-context/non_ascii.json' does not exist. This means that the function is unable to open the file and read its contents, leading to a FileNotFoundError.

The potential error location within the function is the line:
```python
with open(context_file) as file_handle:
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is trying to open a file that does not exist.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the file exists before attempting to open it. We can use the `os.path.exists()` function to check for the existence of the file.

Below is the corrected code for the `generate_context` function:

```python
import os

def generate_context(
    context_file='cookiecutter.json', default_context=None, extra_context=None
):
    """Generate the context for a Cookiecutter project template.

    Loads the JSON file as a Python object, with key being the JSON filename.

    :param context_file: JSON file containing key/value pairs for populating
        the cookiecutter's variables.
    :param default_context: Dictionary containing config to take into account.
    :param extra_context: Dictionary containing configuration overrides
    """
    context = OrderedDict([])

    if os.path.exists(context_file):
        with open(context_file) as file_handle:
            obj = json.load(file_handle, object_pairs_hook=OrderedDict)
    else:
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"The file {context_file} does not exist.")

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

In the corrected code, before trying to open the file, we check if the file exists using `os.path.exists()`. If the file does not exist, a FileNotFoundError is raised with an appropriate message. If the file exists, it is opened and its contents are loaded into the `obj` variable as before.
