The error message indicates a `FileNotFoundError`, which means the function is unable to find the file 'non_ascii.json'.

Looking at the function, the issue is occurring within the `try` block. When trying to open the `context_file` in the `with open` statement, the file is not found, resulting in a `FileNotFoundError`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is trying to open the file using a relative path ('tests/test-generate-context/non_ascii.json'), assuming that the file is in the current working directory. However, the file might not be present in the specified location, leading to the FileNotFoundError.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to provide the absolute path of the file instead of the relative path. Another approach is to handle the case where the file is not found by providing a more descriptive error message or raising a custom exception.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function with error handling for the file not found scenario:

```python
import os
import json
from collections import OrderedDict

class ContextDecodingException(Exception):
    pass

def apply_overwrites_to_context(obj, overwrites):
    # function definition here
    pass

def generate_context(context_file='cookiecutter.json', default_context=None, extra_context=None):
    """Generate the context for a Cookiecutter project template.

    Loads the JSON file as a Python object, with key being the JSON filename.

    :param context_file: JSON file containing key/value pairs for populating
        the cookiecutter's variables.
    :param default_context: Dictionary containing config to take into account.
    :param extra_context: Dictionary containing configuration overrides
    """
    context = OrderedDict([])

    try:
        with open(context_file) as file_handle:
            obj = json.load(file_handle, object_pairs_hook=OrderedDict)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        full_fpath = os.path.abspath(context_file)
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"{context_file} not found at {full_fpath}")
    except ValueError as e:
        full_fpath = os.path.abspath(context_file)
        json_exc_message = str(e)
        our_exc_message = f'JSON decoding error while loading "{full_fpath}".  Decoding error details: "{json_exc_message}"'
        raise ContextDecodingException(our_exc_message)

    file_name = os.path.split(context_file)[1]
    file_stem = file_name.split('.')[0]
    context[file_stem] = obj

    if default_context:
        apply_overwrites_to_context(obj, default_context)
    if extra_context:
        apply_overwrites_to_context(obj, extra_context)

    return context
```

In the corrected code, we handle the `FileNotFoundError` by raising a new `FileNotFoundError` with a more descriptive error message. This will make it easier to identify the issue if the file specified in `context_file` is not found.
