The error message indicates that the file 'tests/test-generate-context/non_ascii.json' was not found, leading to the FileNotFoundError. This suggests that the issue lies in the function's attempt to open the file specified by the context_file parameter.

The bug occurs because the function is trying to load the context from the JSON file specified by the context_file parameter without taking into account the provided file path. It is attempting to open the file relative to the current working directory, resulting in a FileNotFoundError.

To fix this bug, the function needs to load the JSON file using the correct file path. This can be achieved by using the full path to the file or by joining the specified file path with the current working directory.

Here is the corrected code for the generate_context function:

```python
import os

def generate_context(
    context_file='cookiecutter.json', default_context=None, extra_context=None
):
    """Generate the context for a Cookiecutter project template.

    Loads the JSON file as a Python object, with key being the JSON filename.

    :param context_file: JSON file containing key/value pairs for populating
        the cookiecutter's variables.
    :param default_context: Dictionary containing config to take into account.
    :param extra_context: Dictionary containing configuration overrides
    """
    context = OrderedDict()

    # Get the full path to the context_file
    context_file_path = os.path.abspath(context_file)

    try:
        with open(context_file_path) as file_handle:
            obj = json.load(file_handle, object_pairs_hook=OrderedDict)
    except ValueError as e:
        # JSON decoding error.  Let's throw a new exception that is more
        # friendly for the developer or user.
        json_exc_message = str(e)
        our_exc_message = (
            f'JSON decoding error while loading "{context_file_path}".  Decoding'
            f' error details: "{json_exc_message}"'
        )
        raise ContextDecodingException(our_exc_message)

    # Add the Python object to the context dictionary
    file_name = os.path.split(context_file_path)[1]
    file_stem = file_name.split('.')[0]
    context[file_stem] = obj

    # Overwrite context variable defaults with the default context from the
    # user's global config, if available
    if default_context:
        apply_overwrites_to_context(obj, default_context)
    if extra_context:
        apply_overwrites_to_context(obj, extra_context)

    logger.debug('Context generated is %s', context)
    return context
```

In the corrected code, the full path to the context_file is obtained using `os.path.abspath(context_file)`. This ensures that the file is opened from the correct location regardless of the current working directory.
