The error message indicates a "FileNotFoundError", stating that the file 'tests/test-generate-context/non_ascii.json' could not be found. Upon analyzing the provided code and the test case, it is evident that the issue lies within the `generate_context` function.

The potential error location is within the `generate_context` function, specifically in the `with open(context_file) as file_handle` block. The error occurs because the code is attempting to open the file 'tests/test-generate-context/non_ascii.json', but it seems to be unable to find the file at that location.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely that the file path provided to `context_file` is incorrect or the file is not located in the specified directory. 

To fix the bug, you can consider the following approaches:
1. Verify that the file 'tests/test-generate-context/non_ascii.json' exists in the specified location.
2. If the file exists, ensure that the path provided in the `context_file` parameter of the `generate_context` function is correct and accessible.
3. Make sure that the file path is relative to the location of the script or provide the full/absolute file path.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import json
import os
from collections import OrderedDict

def apply_overwrites_to_context(context, overwrite_context):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def generate_context(context_file='cookiecutter.json', default_context=None, extra_context=None):
    context = OrderedDict([])

    try:
        with open(context_file, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file_handle:
            obj = json.load(file_handle, object_pairs_hook=OrderedDict)
    except ValueError as e:
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    file_name = os.path.split(context_file)[1]
    file_stem = file_name.split('.')[0]
    context[file_stem] = obj

    if default_context:
        apply_overwrites_to_context(obj, default_context)
    if extra_context:
        apply_overwrites_to_context(obj, extra_context)

    logger.debug('Context generated is %s', context)
    return context
```

In the corrected code, changes have been made in the `with open(context_file, 'r', encoding='utf-8') as file_handle` block to ensure proper file handling. The file is opened in read mode with utf-8 encoding to prevent potential encoding issues. Additionally, the error handling part within the `except` block should be implemented as per the specific use case or requirements.
