The error message indicates a FileNotFoundError, which suggests that the function `generate_context` is trying to open a file that does not exist. This error occurs at the line `with open(context_file) as file_handle`. 

The reason for this error is that the `context_file` variable is being used directly without considering its relative path. The context file path should be relative to the file in which the function is being called, and it seems that the function is looking for the file in the wrong directory.

To fix this issue, we can use the `os.path` module to get the absolute path of the context file relative to the file containing the `generate_context` function. This will ensure that the correct file path is used for opening the context file.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_context` function:

```python
import os

def generate_context(
    context_file='cookiecutter.json', default_context=None, extra_context=None
):
    """Generate the context for a Cookiecutter project template.

    Loads the JSON file as a Python object, with key being the JSON filename.

    :param context_file: JSON file containing key/value pairs for populating
        the cookiecutter's variables.
    :param default_context: Dictionary containing config to take into account.
    :param extra_context: Dictionary containing configuration overrides
    """
    context = OrderedDict([])

    full_fpath = os.path.abspath(context_file)

    try:
        with open(full_fpath) as file_handle:
            obj = json.load(file_handle, object_pairs_hook=OrderedDict)
    except ValueError as e:
        # JSON decoding error.  Let's throw a new exception that is more
        # friendly for the developer or user.
        json_exc_message = str(e)
        our_exc_message = (
            'JSON decoding error while loading "{0}".  Decoding'
            ' error details: "{1}"'.format(full_fpath, json_exc_message)
        )
        raise ContextDecodingException(our_exc_message)

    # Add the Python object to the context dictionary
    file_name = os.path.split(context_file)[1]
    file_stem = file_name.split('.')[0]
    context[file_stem] = obj

    # Overwrite context variable defaults with the default context from the
    # user's global config, if available
    if default_context:
        apply_overwrites_to_context(obj, default_context)
    if extra_context:
        apply_overwrites_to_context(obj, extra_context)

    logger.debug('Context generated is %s', context)
    return context
