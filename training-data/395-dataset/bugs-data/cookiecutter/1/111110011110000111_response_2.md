The error message indicates that the function `generate_context` is trying to open a file `tests/test-generate-context/non_ascii.json` but is unable to find it, resulting in a `FileNotFoundError`. This indicates that the function is not correctly handling the file path provided to it.

The potential error location within the function is the `open` function where it tries to open the `context_file`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is expecting the `context_file` to be located in the current working directory, but it is actually located within a subdirectory.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to provide the correct path to the `context_file` within the function `generate_context`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import os
import json
from collections import OrderedDict

def generate_context(
    context_file='cookiecutter.json', default_context=None, extra_context=None
):
    """Generate the context for a Cookiecutter project template.

    Loads the JSON file as a Python object, with key being the JSON filename.

    :param context_file: JSON file containing key/value pairs for populating
        the cookiecutter's variables. Can be a relative or absolute path.
    :param default_context: Dictionary containing config to take into account.
    :param extra_context: Dictionary containing configuration overrides
    """
    context = OrderedDict([])

    full_path = context_file
    if not os.path.isabs(context_file):
        # If the provided path is not absolute, make it absolute
        full_path = os.path.join(os.getcwd(), context_file)

    try:
        with open(full_path) as file_handle:
            obj = json.load(file_handle, object_pairs_hook=OrderedDict)

        # Add the Python object to the context dictionary
        file_name = os.path.split(context_file)[1]
        file_stem = file_name.split('.')[0]
        context[file_stem] = obj

        # Overwrite context variable defaults with the default context from the
        # user's global config, if available
        if default_context:
            apply_overwrites_to_context(obj, default_context)
        if extra_context:
            apply_overwrites_to_context(obj, extra_context)

        logger.debug('Context generated is %s', context)
        return context

    except ValueError as e:
        # JSON decoding error.  Let's throw a new exception that is more
        # friendly for the developer or user.
        full_fpath = os.path.abspath(context_file)
        json_exc_message = str(e)
        our_exc_message = (
            'JSON decoding error while loading "{0}".  Decoding'
            ' error details: "{1}"'.format(full_fpath, json_exc_message)
        )
        raise ContextDecodingException(our_exc_message)
```

This corrected code includes checking if the provided `context_file` path is absolute or relative, and making it absolute if necessary. This will ensure that the function `generate_context` correctly handles the file path provided to it.
