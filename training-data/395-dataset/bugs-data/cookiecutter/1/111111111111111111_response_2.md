The error message indicates that the file 'tests/test-generate-context/non_ascii.json' is not found, which implies that the function is not able to locate the file as expected.

The potential error location is within the 'generate_context' function, specifically in the 'try' block where the file is attempted to be opened.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the function is looking for the 'non_ascii.json' file in the wrong directory. The file path needs to be relative to the location of the script or the current working directory.

To fix the bug, we can use the `os.path` module to construct the absolute path of the file based on the script's current directory. We can also handle the exception and provide more detailed information in the error message if the file is not found.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import os

def generate_context(
    context_file='cookiecutter.json', default_context=None, extra_context=None
):
    """Generate the context for a Cookiecutter project template.

    Loads the JSON file as a Python object, with key being the JSON filename.

    :param context_file: JSON file containing key/value pairs for populating
        the cookiecutter's variables.
    :param default_context: Dictionary containing config to take into account.
    :param extra_context: Dictionary containing configuration overrides
    """
    context = OrderedDict([])

    context_file_path = os.path.abspath(context_file)

    try:
        with open(context_file_path) as file_handle:
            obj = json.load(file_handle, object_pairs_hook=OrderedDict)
    except FileNotFoundError:
        raise FileNotFoundError(f"The file '{context_file}' does not exist.")

    # Add the Python object to the context dictionary
    file_name = os.path.split(context_file)[1]
    file_stem = file_name.split('.')[0]
    context[file_stem] = obj

    # Overwrite context variable defaults with the default context from the
    # user's global config, if available
    if default_context:
        apply_overwrites_to_context(obj, default_context)
    if extra_context:
        apply_overwrites_to_context(obj, extra_context)

    logger.debug('Context generated is %s', context)
    return context
```

With these changes, the function should be able to correctly locate and load the JSON file, and the test case should no longer encounter a 'FileNotFoundError'.
