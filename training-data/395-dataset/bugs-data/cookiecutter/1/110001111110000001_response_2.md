The error message indicates that the file 'tests/test-generate-context/non_ascii.json' cannot be found. This suggests that the problem lies in the `generate_context` function where the file is being opened.

The bug occurs because the function attempts to open the `context_file` directly without considering the path from which the function is called. It assumes that the file is located in the same directory as the script, which is not the case.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to construct the correct path to the `context_file` based on the location of the script.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_context` function:

```python
import os
import json
from collections import OrderedDict

# relative function's signature in this file
def apply_overwrites_to_context(context, overwrite_context):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass


    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def generate_context(
        context_file='cookiecutter.json', default_context=None, extra_context=None
    ):
        """Generate the context for a Cookiecutter project template.

        Loads the JSON file as a Python object, with key being the JSON filename.

        :param context_file: JSON file containing key/value pairs for populating
            the cookiecutter's variables.
        :param default_context: Dictionary containing config to take into account.
        :param extra_context: Dictionary containing configuration overrides
        """
        context = OrderedDict([])

        script_path = os.path.dirname(os.path.realpath(__file__))
        full_context_path = os.path.join(script_path, context_file)

        try:
            with open(full_context_path) as file_handle:
                obj = json.load(file_handle, object_pairs_hook=OrderedDict)
        except ValueError as e:
            # JSON decoding error.  Let's throw a new exception that is more
            # friendly for the developer or user.
            full_fpath = os.path.abspath(context_file)
            json_exc_message = str(e)
            our_exc_message = (
                'JSON decoding error while loading "{0}".  Decoding'
                ' error details: "{1}"'.format(full_fpath, json_exc_message)
            )
            raise ContextDecodingException(our_exc_message)

        # Add the Python object to the context dictionary
        file_name = os.path.split(context_file)[1]
        file_stem = file_name.split('.')[0]
        context[file_stem] = obj

        # Overwrite context variable defaults with the default context from the
        # user's global config, if available
        if default_context:
            apply_overwrites_to_context(obj, default_context)
        if extra_context:
            apply_overwrites_to_context(obj, extra_context)

        logger.debug('Context generated is %s', context)
        return context
```

With this modification, the function will be able to correctly locate and open the `context_file`, fixing the bug that caused the FileNotFoundError.
