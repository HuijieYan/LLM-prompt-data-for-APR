The bug in the provided code is likely in the line:

```python
if not isinstance(options, list):
        raise TypeError
```

The error was likely triggered due to a misinterpretation of the `options` variable type. The code checks if the `options` variable is of type `list`, but it should be checking if it's an instance of a sequence or iterable type instead.

To fix the bug and improve the functionality of the function, you can modify the code to check if `options` is an instance of a sequence type, such as `tuple` or `list`, using the `collections.abc` module and the `Sequence` abstract base class. You can also remove the hard dependency on `list` and replace it with a more general check for sequences.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from collections.abc import Sequence

def read_user_choice(var_name, options):
    """Prompt the user to choose from several options for the given variable.

    The first item will be returned if no input happens.

    :param str var_name: Variable as specified in the context
    :param Sequence options: Sequence of options that are available to select from
    :return: Exactly one item of ``options`` that has been chosen by the user
    """
    if not isinstance(options, Sequence):
        raise TypeError("options must be a sequence type")

    if not options:
        raise ValueError("options cannot be empty")

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
``` 

The modified code replaces the hard check for `list` type with a check for `Sequence` from the `collections.abc` module, which can handle various sequence types. This ensures that the function will work with any sequence type, such as lists, tuples, and other iterable sequence types.
