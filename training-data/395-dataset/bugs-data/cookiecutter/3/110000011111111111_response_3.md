Based on the test case and error message, there seems to be an issue with the assertion of the "prompt" method being called in the test case. The "show_choices" argument is expected to be False, but it is not being passed correctly in the actual call to "prompt".

The potential error location in the function is the "user_choice" line where click.prompt is called. It seems that the "show_choices" argument might not be getting passed correctly in the actual call.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the "show_choices" argument is not being handled correctly in the function call to click.prompt.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the "show_choices" argument is being passed correctly in the call to click.prompt. We also need to verify if the default value is being set correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from collections import OrderedDict
import click

def read_user_choice(var_name, options):
    """Prompt the user to choose from several options for the given variable.

    The first item will be returned if no input happens.

    :param str var_name: Variable as specified in the context
    :param list options: Sequence of options that are available to select from
    :return: Exactly one item of ``options`` that has been chosen by the user
    """
    if not isinstance(options, list):
        raise TypeError

    if not options:
        raise ValueError

    choice_map = OrderedDict(
        (u'{}'.format(i), value) for i, value in enumerate(options, 1)
    )
    choices = list(choice_map.keys())
    default = u'1'

    choice_lines = [u'{} - {}'.format(*c) for c in choice_map.items()]
    prompt = u'\n'.join((
        u'Select {}:'.format(var_name),
        u'\n'.join(choice_lines),
        u'Choose from {}'.format(u', '.join(choices))
    ))

    user_choice = click.prompt(
        prompt, type=click.Choice(choices), default=default, show_choices=False
    )
    return choice_map[user_choice]
```
In the corrected code, we set "show_choices=False" directly in the call to click.prompt to ensure it is passed correctly. We also explicitly converted the choice_map keys into a list to avoid any issues with the keys. Additionally, we verified the correct default value and ensured that the "show_choices" argument is passed correctly.
