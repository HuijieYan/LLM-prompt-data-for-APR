Potential error location: The error could be occurring in the line where the user_choice is being prompted using click.prompt.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. There is a missing import statement for the "click" module, which is used for prompting the user for input.
2. The missing import statement could be causing the function to throw an error when trying to use click.prompt.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Import the click module at the beginning of the script using: `import click`
2. Ensure that the click module is installed by running: `pip install click` if it's not already installed.

Corrected code for the function:
```python
import click
from collections import OrderedDict

def read_user_choice(var_name, options):
    """Prompt the user to choose from several options for the given variable.

    The first item will be returned if no input happens.

    :param str var_name: Variable as specified in the context
    :param list options: Sequence of options that are available to select from
    :return: Exactly one item of ``options`` that has been chosen by the user
    """
    # Please see http://click.pocoo.org/4/api/#click.prompt
    if not isinstance(options, list):
        raise TypeError

    if not options:
        raise ValueError

    choice_map = OrderedDict(
        (u'{}'.format(i), value) for i, value in enumerate(options, 1)
    )
    choices = choice_map.keys()
    default = u'1'

    choice_lines = [u'{} - {}'.format(*c) for c in choice_map.items()]
    prompt = u'\n'.join((
        u'Select {}:'.format(var_name),
        u'\n'.join(choice_lines),
        u'Choose from {}'.format(u', '.join(choices))
    ))

    user_choice = click.prompt(
        prompt, type=click.Choice(choices), default=default
    )
    return choice_map[user_choice]

```
