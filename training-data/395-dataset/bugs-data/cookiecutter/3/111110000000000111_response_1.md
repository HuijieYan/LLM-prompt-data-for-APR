The error in the given function is that it is missing the required import statement for the `OrderedDict` and `click` modules.

The error location is at the line `choice_map = OrderedDict(...)` and `user_choice = click.prompt(...)`

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the `OrderedDict` and `click` modules are not imported. Additionally, the `click` module is used for the prompt method but it has not been imported.

To fix the bug, we need to import the required modules at the beginning of the code. We also need to install the `click` module if it is not already installed.

Here's the corrected code for the provided function:

```python
from collections import OrderedDict
import click

def read_user_choice(var_name, options):
    """Prompt the user to choose from several options for the given variable.

    The first item will be returned if no input happens.

    :param str var_name: Variable as specified in the context
    :param list options: Sequence of options that are available to select from
    :return: Exactly one item of ``options` that has been chosen by the user
    """
    if not isinstance(options, list):
        raise TypeError("options must be a list")

    if not options:
        raise ValueError("options cannot be empty")

    choice_map = OrderedDict(
        (u'{}'.format(i), value) for i, value in enumerate(options, 1)
    )
    choices = choice_map.keys()
    default = u'1'

    choice_lines = [u'{} - {}'.format(*c) for c in choice_map.items()]
    prompt = u'\n'.join((
        u'Select {}:'.format(var_name),
        u'\n'.join(choice_lines),
        u'Choose from {}'.format(u', '.join(choices))
    ))

    user_choice = click.prompt(
        prompt, type=click.Choice(choices), default=default
    )
    return choice_map[user_choice]

```

In the corrected code, the `OrderedDict` and `click` modules have been imported at the beginning of the script. Additionally, I have added informative error messages for the `TypeError` and `ValueError` cases.
