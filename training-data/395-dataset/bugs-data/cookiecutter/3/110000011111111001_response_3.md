The error message is related to the `prompt` function being called with different keyword arguments in the test case than expected. This is causing the assertion error as the test is expecting a specific call to the `prompt` function.

The bug seems to be in how the function `read_user_choice` is calling the `click.prompt` function and handling the arguments. The expected parameters for the `prompt` function in the test cases are not matching with what is actually passed from the `read_user_choice` function, which is causing the test failures.

The bug is due to the mismatch of the `show_choices` keyword argument while calling `click.prompt` function. The `show_choices=False` keyword argument should be included in the function call in the correct location.

To fix the bug, the `click.prompt` function should be called with the `show_choices` keyword argument included, set to `False`. This will align the function call with the expected values in the test cases.

```python
def read_user_choice(var_name, options):
    # Other parts of the code remain unchanged
    
    user_choice = click.prompt(
        prompt, type=click.Choice(choices), default=default, show_choices=False
    )
    return choice_map[user_choice]

```
By adding `show_choices=False` to the `click.prompt` function call, the bug should be fixed and the test cases should pass successfully.
