Potential error location: The potential error location is where the user input is being processed and returned.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug is occurring because the `click.prompt` method is not being used correctly to handle user input.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: One approach for fixing the bug is to properly use the `click.prompt` method to handle user input by specifying the type and default values.

Corrected code:

```python
from collections import OrderedDict
import click

def read_user_choice(var_name, options):
    """Prompt the user to choose from several options for the given variable.

    The first item will be returned if no input happens.

    :param str var_name: Variable as specified in the context
    :param list options: Sequence of options that are available to select from
    :return: Exactly one item of ``options`` that has been chosen by the user
    """
    if not isinstance(options, list):
        raise TypeError("Options must be a list")

    if not options:
        raise ValueError("Options list cannot be empty")

    choice_map = OrderedDict(
        (str(i), value) for i, value in enumerate(options, 1)
    )
    choices = list(choice_map.keys())
    default = '1'

    choice_lines = ['{} - {}'.format(*c) for c in choice_map.items()]
    prompt = '\n'.join((
        'Select {}:'.format(var_name),
        '\n'.join(choice_lines),
        'Choose from {}'.format(', '.join(choices))
    ))

    user_choice = click.prompt(
        prompt, type=click.Choice(choices), default=default
    )

    return choice_map[user_choice]
```
