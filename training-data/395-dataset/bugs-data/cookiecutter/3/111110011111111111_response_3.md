The error message indicates that the `click.prompt` function call is not matching the expected call. The 'show_choices' argument is expected to be `False` but it is not being passed, causing the mismatch.

The bug is in the `click.prompt` function call where the 'show_choices' argument is not being passed as expected, leading to the test case failure.

To fix the bug, the 'show_choices' argument needs to be passed in the `click.prompt` function call with the value `False`. This will ensure that the expected call matches the actual call and the test case should pass.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def read_user_choice(var_name, options):
    """Prompt the user to choose from several options for the given variable.

    The first item will be returned if no input happens.

    :param str var_name: Variable as specified in the context
    :param list options: Sequence of options that are available to select from
    :return: Exactly one item of ``options`` that has been chosen by the user
    """
    import click
    from collections import OrderedDict

    if not isinstance(options, list):
        raise TypeError

    if not options:
        raise ValueError

    choice_map = OrderedDict(
        (u'{}'.format(i), value) for i, value in enumerate(options, 1)
    )
    choices = choice_map.keys()
    default = u'1'

    choice_lines = [u'{} - {}'.format(*c) for c in choice_map.items()]
    prompt = u'\n'.join((
        u'Select {}:'.format(var_name),
        u'\n'.join(choice_lines),
        u'Choose from {}'.format(u', '.join(choices))
    ))

    user_choice = click.prompt(
        prompt, type=click.Choice(choices), default=default, show_choices=False
    )
    return choice_map[user_choice]
```

This modification should fix the bug in the `read_user_choice` function.
