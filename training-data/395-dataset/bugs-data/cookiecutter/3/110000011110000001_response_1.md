The error occurs when the test function `test_click_invocation` is trying to validate if the `prompt` method has been called with the expected arguments. The error happens because the method is called with different arguments than expected, specifically the `show_choices` argument is missing.

The potential error is within the `read_user_choice` function, more specifically when constructing the `prompt` message.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that `show_choices` argument is not included in the call to the `prompt` method. This causes the test to fail as it expects this argument to be present.

To fix the bug, the `show_choices` argument should be included in the `prompt` method call along with other arguments.

Here's the corrected code for the `read_user_choice` function:

```python
from collections import OrderedDict
import click

def read_user_choice(var_name, options):
    if not isinstance(options, list):
        raise TypeError

    if not options:
        raise ValueError

    choice_map = OrderedDict(
        (u'{}'.format(i), value) for i, value in enumerate(options, 1)
    )
    choices = choice_map.keys()
    default = u'1'

    choice_lines = [u'{} - {}'.format(*c) for c in choice_map.items()]
    prompt = u'\n'.join((
        u'Select {}:'.format(var_name),
        u'\n'.join(choice_lines),
        u'Choose from {}'.format(u', '.join(choices))
    ))

    user_choice = click.prompt(
        prompt, type=click.Choice(choices), default=default, show_choices=True  # Include show_choices argument
    )
    return choice_map[user_choice]
```

With this correction, the `show_choices` argument is included in the call to the `prompt` method, which addresses the issue raised in the test function.
