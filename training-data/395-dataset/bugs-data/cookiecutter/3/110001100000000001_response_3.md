The potential error locations within the problematic function are as follows:
1. The function attempts to import `click` but does not have the `import click` statement, so `click` needs to be imported at the beginning of the file.
2. The `OrderedDict` is used without being imported. It should be imported from the `collections` module at the beginning of the file.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The `click` module is not imported, so the function cannot access the `click` module's prompt function.
2. The `OrderedDict` is used without being imported, resulting in a NameError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Import the `click` module at the beginning of the file.
2. Import `OrderedDict` from the `collections` module at the beginning of the file.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import click
from collections import OrderedDict

def read_user_choice(var_name, options):
    """Prompt the user to choose from several options for the given variable.

    The first item will be returned if no input happens.

    :param str var_name: Variable as specified in the context
    :param list options: Sequence of options that are available to select from
    :return: Exactly one item of ``options`` that has been chosen by the user
    """
    # Please see http://click.pocoo.org/4/api/#click.prompt
    if not isinstance(options, list):
        raise TypeError

    if not options:
        raise ValueError

    choice_map = OrderedDict(
        (u'{}'.format(i), value) for i, value in enumerate(options, 1)
    )
    choices = choice_map.keys()
    default = u'1'

    choice_lines = [u'{} - {}'.format(*c) for c in choice_map.items()]
    prompt = u'\n'.join((
        u'Select {}:'.format(var_name),
        u'\n'.join(choice_lines),
        u'Choose from {}'.format(u', '.join(choices))
    ))

    user_choice = click.prompt(
        prompt, type=click.Choice(choices), default=default
    )
    return choice_map[user_choice]
```
