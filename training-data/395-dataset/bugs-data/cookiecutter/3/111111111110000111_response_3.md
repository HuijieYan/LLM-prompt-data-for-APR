Potential Error Location:
The error occurs in the function `read_user_choice` on the line `prompt.assert_called_once_with`. It seems that the show_choices parameter is not being taken into account while calling the function.

Reason for the Bug:
The error may be occurring because the function `click.prompt` is not being called with the parameter `show_choices` as expected.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
The `click.prompt` function should be called with the correct parameters including `show_choices` to ensure that the function is being utilized as expected.

Corrected Code:
```python
def read_user_choice(var_name, options):
    """Prompt the user to choose from several options for the given variable.

    The first item will be returned if no input happens.

    :param str var_name: Variable as specified in the context
    :param list options: Sequence of options that are available to select from
    :return: Exactly one item of ``options`` that has been chosen by the user
    """
    # Please see http://click.pocoo.org/4/api/#click.prompt
    if not isinstance(options, list):
        raise TypeError

    if not options:
        raise ValueError

    choice_map = OrderedDict(
        (u'{}'.format(i), value) for i, value in enumerate(options, 1)
    )
    choices = choice_map.keys()
    default = u'1'

    choice_lines = [u'{} - {}'.format(*c) for c in choice_map.items()]
    prompt = u'\n'.join((
        u'Select {}:'.format(var_name),
        u'\n'.join(choice_lines),
        u'Choose from {}'.format(u', '.join(choices))
    ))

    user_choice = click.prompt(
        prompt, type=click.Choice(choices), default=default, show_choices=False
    )
    return choice_map[user_choice]
```
