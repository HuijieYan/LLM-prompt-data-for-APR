The error is likely occurring in the condition for the type check of the 'options' parameter. This is because the 'isinstance' method is being used to check if 'options' is a list, but this method does not work properly with ordered dictionaries.

The bug occurs because the function is incorrectly checking whether 'options' is a list using the 'isinstance' method, which does not work properly with ordered dictionaries.

To fix the bug, the function can be modified to directly check if 'options' is an instance of a list or an ordered dictionary. Once this is done, the condition checking for 'options' being empty can be left as is.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
from collections import OrderedDict

def read_user_choice(var_name, options):
    """Prompt the user to choose from several options for the given variable.

    The first item will be returned if no input happens.

    :param str var_name: Variable as specified in the context
    :param list options: Sequence of options that are available to select from
    :return: Exactly one item of ``options`` that has been chosen by the user
    """

    if not isinstance(options, (list, OrderedDict)):
        raise TypeError

    if not options:
        raise ValueError

    choice_map = OrderedDict(
        (u'{}'.format(i), value) for i, value in enumerate(options, 1)
    )
    choices = choice_map.keys()
    default = u'1'

    choice_lines = [u'{} - {}'.format(*c) for c in choice_map.items()]
    prompt = u'\n'.join((
        u'Select {}:'.format(var_name),
        u'\n'.join(choice_lines),
        u'Choose from {}'.format(u', '.join(choices))
    ))

    user_choice = input(
        prompt
    )
    return choice_map[user_choice]
```
