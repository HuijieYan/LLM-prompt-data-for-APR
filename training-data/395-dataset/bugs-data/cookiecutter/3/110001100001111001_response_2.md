It seems that the problematic function is not handling the input `options` correctly. The function is expecting `options` to be a list, but it is not checking if the elements inside the list are of string type.

Upon analysis, the bug location is likely within the `choice_map` variable initialization. It seems the issue arises from trying to format the index value `i` as a string by using `u'{}'.format(i)`. This operation could lead to a potential type mismatch between keys and values in `choice_map`.

One approach to fixing the bug would be to ensure that the keys in `choice_map` are consistently string types, as the `click.prompt` method returns a string as well. Additionally, it would be beneficial to check if the elements in the `options` list are of string type before creating the `choice_map`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from collections import OrderedDict
import click

def read_user_choice(var_name, options):
    """Prompt the user to choose from several options for the given variable.

    The first item will be returned if no input happens.

    :param str var_name: Variable as specified in the context
    :param list options: Sequence of options that are available to select from
    :return: Exactly one item of ``options`` that has been chosen by the user
    """
    if not isinstance(options, list):
        raise TypeError("options should be of type list")

    if not all(isinstance(option, str) for option in options):
        raise ValueError("All elements in options should be of type string")

    if not options:
        raise ValueError("options list should not be empty")

    choice_map = OrderedDict(
        (str(i), value) for i, value in enumerate(options, 1)
    )
    choices = choice_map.keys()
    default = '1'

    choice_lines = [f'{key} - {value}' for key, value in choice_map.items()]
    prompt = '\n'.join((
        f'Select {var_name}:',
        '\n'.join(choice_lines),
        f'Choose from {", ".join(choices)}'
    ))

    user_choice = click.prompt(
        prompt, type=click.Choice(choices), default=default
    )
    return choice_map[user_choice]
```

This corrected code ensures that the keys in `choice_map` are of type string and validates that all elements in the `options` list are of type string before creating `choice_map`.
