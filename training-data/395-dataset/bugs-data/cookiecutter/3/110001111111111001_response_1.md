The error is occurring because the 'show_choices' parameter is expected to be False, but it is not present in the actual call to the prompt. This is causing the assertion to fail.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the prompt statement where 'show_choices' is not specified.

The bug occurred due to the missing 'show_choices' parameter in the call to the 'prompt' function.

To fix this bug, the 'show_choices' parameter needs to be explicitly set to False in the call to the 'prompt' function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def read_user_choice(var_name, options):
    """Prompt the user to choose from several options for the given variable.

    The first item will be returned if no input happens.

    :param str var_name: Variable as specified in the context
    :param list options: Sequence of options that are available to select from
    :return: Exactly one item of ``options`` that has been chosen by the user
    """
    if not isinstance(options, list):
        raise TypeError

    if not options:
        raise ValueError

    choice_map = OrderedDict(
        (u'{}'.format(i), value) for i, value in enumerate(options, 1)
    )
    choices = choice_map.keys()
    default = u'1'

    choice_lines = [u'{} - {}'.format(*c) for c in choice_map.items()]
    prompt = u'\n'.join((
        u'Select {}:'.format(var_name),
        u'\n'.join(choice_lines),
        u'Choose from {}'.format(u', '.join(choices))
    ))

    user_choice = click.prompt(
        prompt, type=click.Choice(choices), default=default, show_choices=False
    )
    return choice_map[user_choice]
```
