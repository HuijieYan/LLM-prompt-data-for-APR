The bug is in the function 'read_user_choice'. The 'click.prompt' method is being used with the parameter 'show_choices', but this parameter was only added in a later version of 'click', so the code is not functioning correctly due to that. The error is causing the 'show_choices' parameter to be passed incorrectly. 

The potential bug location is identified in the 'read_user_choice' method near the line:
```python
user_choice = click.prompt(promt, type=click.Choice(choices), default=default)
```

The 'click.prompt' function does not have a 'show_choices' parameter, which is leading to the error in the provided test cases.

To fix the bug, the 'show_choices' parameter should be removed from the 'click.prompt' method.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def read_user_choice(var_name, options):
    """Prompt the user to choose from several options for the given variable.

    The first item will be returned if no input happens.

    :param str var_name: Variable as specified in the context
    :param list options: Sequence of options that are available to select from
    :return: Exactly one item of ``options`` that has been chosen by the user
    """
    # Please see http://click.pocoo.org/4/api/#click.prompt
    if not isinstance(options, list):
        raise TypeError

    if not options:
        raise ValueError

    choice_map = OrderedDict(
        (u'{}'.format(i), value) for i, value in enumerate(options, 1)
    )
    choices = choice_map.keys()
    default = u'1'

    choice_lines = [u'{} - {}'.format(*c) for c in choice_map.items()]
    prompt = u'\n'.join((
        u'Select {}:'.format(var_name),
        u'\n'.join(choice_lines),
        u'Choose from {}'.format(u', '.join(choices))
    ))

    user_choice = click.prompt(
        prompt, type=click.Choice(choices), default=default
    )
    return choice_map[user_choice]
```
