The error is occurring in the `read_user_choice` function. The `click.prompt` function is expected to be called with the arguments `('Select varname:\n1 - hello\n2 - world\n3 - foo\n4 - bar\nChoose from 1, 2, 3, 4', default='1', show_choices=False, type=<MagicMock name='Choice()' id='4350978064'>)` but it is actually being called with `('Select varname:\n1 - hello\n2 - world\n3 - foo\n4 - bar\nChoose from 1, 2, 3, 4', default='1', type=<MagicMock name='Choice()' id='4350978064'>)`.

The reason behind this bug is that the `show_choices` parameter is not being included in the `click.prompt` function call, as expected by the test. This is causing the assertion error.

To fix this bug, the `show_choices` parameter should be added to the `click.prompt` function call with the value as `False`. Additionally, the `click.Choice` instance should be created and returned in line with the specific options.

Here is the corrected `read_user_choice` function:

```python
import click
from collections import OrderedDict

def read_user_choice(var_name, options):
    """Prompt the user to choose from several options for the given variable.

    The first item will be returned if no input happens.

    :param str var_name: Variable as specified in the context
    :param list options: Sequence of options that are available to select from
    :return: Exactly one item of ``options`` that has been chosen by the user
    """
    if not isinstance(options, list):
        raise TypeError("options must be a list")

    if not options:
        raise ValueError("options cannot be empty")

    choice_map = OrderedDict((u'{}'.format(i), value) for i, value in enumerate(options, 1))
    choices = [str(i) for i, value in enumerate(options, 1)]
    default = '1'

    choice_lines = [u'{} - {}'.format(*c) for c in choice_map.items()]
    prompt = u'\n'.join((
        u'Select {}:'.format(var_name),
        u'\n'.join(choice_lines),
        u'Choose from {}'.format(u', '.join(choices))
    ))

    user_choice = click.prompt(prompt, type=click.Choice(choices), default=default, show_choices=False)
    return choice_map[user_choice]
```

In the updated code, the `show_choices` parameter is included and set to `False` in the `click.prompt` function call. This should resolve the assertion error.
