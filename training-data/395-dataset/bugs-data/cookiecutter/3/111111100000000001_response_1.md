Potential error location: The error could be due to the use of the `click.prompt` function, which seems to be imported from the `click` library but not defined within the provided code.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `click.prompt` function is being used, but the `click` library has not been imported or defined within the code. This results in a NameError when the function is called.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Import the `click` library at the beginning of the file, or implement a custom prompt function if the `click` library is not intended to be used.

Corrected code:

```python
# Import the click library
import click
from collections import OrderedDict

def read_user_choice(var_name, options):
    """Prompt the user to choose from several options for the given variable.

    The first item will be returned if no input happens.

    :param str var_name: Variable as specified in the context
    :param list options: Sequence of options that are available to select from
    :return: Exactly one item of ``options`` that has been chosen by the user
    """
    # Check if options is a list
    if not isinstance(options, list):
        raise TypeError

    # Check if options is not empty
    if not options:
        raise ValueError

    # Create a dictionary with numbered options
    choice_map = OrderedDict(
        (u'{}'.format(i), value) for i, value in enumerate(options, 1)
    )
    
    choices = list(choice_map.keys())
    default = u'1'

    choice_lines = [u'{} - {}'.format(*c) for c in choice_map.items()]
    prompt = u'\n'.join((
        u'Select {}:'.format(var_name),
        u'\n'.join(choice_lines),
        u'Choose from {}'.format(u', '.join(choices))
    ))

    # Prompt the user to make a choice
    user_choice = input(prompt)
    while user_choice not in choices:
        print("Invalid choice. Please choose from {}".format(u', '.join(choices)))
        user_choice = input(prompt)
    return choice_map[user_choice]
```
