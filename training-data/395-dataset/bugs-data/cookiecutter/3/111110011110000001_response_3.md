The error message indicates that the `prompt` function is not being called as expected by the test case. It seems that the `show_choices=False` argument is not being passed, which is expected according to the error message.

The potential error in the problematic function is with the `prompt` function call. It seems that the `show_choices` argument is not being passed correctly.

The reason behind the bug might be that the `prompt` function in the original implementation is not handling the `show_choices` argument correctly, which is causing the mismatch between the expected and actual calls in the test case.

To fix the bug, the original `prompt` function call needs to properly handle the `show_choices` argument and pass it when calling `click.prompt`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from collections import OrderedDict
import click

def read_user_choice(var_name, options):
    if not isinstance(options, list):
        raise TypeError("options must be a list")

    if not options:
        raise ValueError("options cannot be empty")

    choice_map = OrderedDict(
        (u'{}'.format(i), value) for i, value in enumerate(options, 1)
    )
    choices = choice_map.keys()
    default = u'1'

    choice_lines = [u'{} - {}'.format(*c) for c in choice_map.items()]
    prompt = u'\n'.join((
        u'Select {}:'.format(var_name),
        u'\n'.join(choice_lines),
        u'Choose from {}'.format(u', '.join(choices))
    ))

    user_choice = click.prompt(
        prompt, type=click.Choice(choices), default=default, show_choices=False
    )
    return choice_map[user_choice]
```

In this corrected code, the `show_choices` argument is explicitly passed to the `click.prompt` function, ensuring that it is handled properly.
