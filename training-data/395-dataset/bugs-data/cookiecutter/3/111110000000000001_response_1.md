Potential error location:
The error may be occurring in the click.prompt() function, which is not defined in the provided code.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The click.prompt() function is not imported or defined within the provided function, so the code would raise an error when executed.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
The click library needs to be imported for the click.prompt() function to work properly. Additionally, the 'OrderedDict' class should also be imported as it is used in the code.

Corrected code:

```python
import click
from collections import OrderedDict

def read_user_choice(var_name, options):
    """Prompt the user to choose from several options for the given variable.

    The first item will be returned if no input happens.

    :param str var_name: Variable as specified in the context
    :param list options: Sequence of options that are available to select from
    :return: Exactly one item of ``options`` that has been chosen by the user
    """
    if not isinstance(options, list):
        raise TypeError("Options must be a list")

    if not options:
        raise ValueError("Options list must not be empty")

    choice_map = OrderedDict(
        (u'{}'.format(i), value) for i, value in enumerate(options, 1)
    )
    choices = list(choice_map.keys())
    default = u'1'

    choice_lines = [u'{} - {}'.format(*c) for c in choice_map.items()]
    prompt = u'\n'.join((
        u'Select {}:'.format(var_name),
        u'\n'.join(choice_lines),
        u'Choose from {}'.format(u', '.join(choices))
    ))

    user_choice = click.prompt(
        prompt, type=click.Choice(choices), default=default
    )
    return choice_map[user_choice]

```
