The error occurs in the `read_user_choice` function, specifically in the call to `click.prompt`. The `prompt` mock is checked by `assert_called_once_with` and `assert_called_with` functions with arguments type, default, and show_choices. The problem is that show_choices=False is expected but not found in the actual call. This indicates that the `click.prompt` doesn't receive the `show_choices` argument, which is causing the assertion to fail.

The bug is likely caused by not passing the `show_choices` parameter to the `click.prompt` method. This results in the discrepancy between the expected and actual calls, leading to the assertion errors.

To fix this bug, the `show_choices` parameter needs to be passed to the `click.prompt` method. 

Additionally, based on the function signature, the `expected_prompt` should be defined before the function is called. Without visibility into the `EXPECTED_PROMPT` variable, it's assumed that is properly defined elsewhere.

The corrected code for the `read_user_choice` function with the fix mentioned above would be:

```python
from collections import OrderedDict
import click

def read_user_choice(var_name, options):
    if not isinstance(options, list):
        raise TypeError

    if not options:
        raise ValueError

    choice_map = OrderedDict((u'{}'.format(i), value) for i, value in enumerate(options, 1))
    choices = choice_map.keys()
    default = u'1'

    choice_lines = [u'{} - {}'.format(*c) for c in choice_map.items()]
    prompt = u'\n'.join((
        u'Select {}:'.format(var_name),
        u'\n'.join(choice_lines),
        u'Choose from {}'.format(u', '.join(choices))
    ))

    user_choice = click.prompt(
        prompt, type=click.Choice(choices), default=default, show_choices=False
    )
    return choice_map[user_choice]
```

By including `show_choices=False` in the `click.prompt` call, the function should now behave as expected and pass the test case without assertion errors.
