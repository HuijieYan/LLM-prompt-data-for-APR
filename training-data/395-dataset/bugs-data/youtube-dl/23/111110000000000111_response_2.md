Potential Error:
The buggy function `js_to_json` is not working correctly and is failing to parse JavaScript code into JSON.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug is likely occurring due to incorrect parsing of the JavaScript code and incorrect handling of special characters and integers.

Possible Approaches:
1. Use the `json` module in Python to directly parse the JavaScript code into JSON.
2. Ensure proper handling of special characters and integers during the parsing process.

Corrected Code:
```python
import json

def js_to_json(code):
    return json.loads(code)
```
