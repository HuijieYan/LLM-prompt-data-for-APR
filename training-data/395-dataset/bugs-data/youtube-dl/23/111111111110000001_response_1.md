The error occurs during the conversion of JavaScript code to JSON. The provided test cases are trying to convert JavaScript code to JSON and then deserialize the JSON to verify its correctness.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of comments and numbers in the JavaScript code. The regular expression used to find and replace JavaScript keys and values is complex, and there might be issues in the implementation of the `fix_kv` function.

The bug most likely occurs due to incorrect handling of comments and numbers in the JavaScript code, resulting in incorrect JSON conversion.

To fix the bug, the `fix_kv` function should be updated to correctly handle comments, numbers, and other non-string values according to the rules of JSON conversion. Additionally, the regular expression used in the `js_to_json` function can also be refined to improve accuracy and performance.

Here's the corrected code for the `js_to_json` function:

```python
import re

def fix_kv(m):
    v = m.group(0)
    if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
        return v
    elif v.startswith('/*') or v == ',':
        return ""

    if v[0] in ("'", '"'):
        v = re.sub(r'(?s)\\.|"', lambda m: {
            '"': '\\"',
            "\\'": "'",
            '\\\n': '',
            '\\x': '\\u00',
        }.get(m.group(0), m.group(0)), v[1:-1])

    return '"%s"' % v

def js_to_json(code):
    return re.sub(r'''(?sx)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nurtbfx/\n]))*[^"\\]*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nurtbfx/\n]))*[^'\\]*'|
        /\*.*?\*/|,(?=\s*[\]}])|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*|
        \b(?:0[xX][0-9a-fA-F]+|0+[0-7]+)(?:\s*:)?|
        [0-9]+(?=\s*:)
        ''', fix_kv, code)
```

With these corrections, the `js_to_json` function should accurately and correctly convert JavaScript code to JSON, resolving the issues identified in the test cases.
