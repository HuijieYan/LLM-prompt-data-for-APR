Potential error location: The potential error in the provided function is the regular expression used in the re.sub() method.

Reason for the bug: The regular expression pattern is overly complex and may not accurately capture all variations of JSON strings. Additionally, the fix_kv method itself may have issues in properly handling different JSON values.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Simplify the regular expression pattern to better handle JSON strings and update the fix_kv method to correctly handle different JSON values.

Corrected code:
```python
import re

def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
            return v
        elif v.startswith('/*') or v == ',':
            return ""

        return v

    return re.sub(r'(\/\*[\s\S]*?\*\/|".*?"|\'.*?\'|true|false|null)', fix_kv, code)
```
