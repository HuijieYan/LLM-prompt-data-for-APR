The potential error in the provided function `js_to_json` is related to the use of regular expressions and the `fix_kv` function to convert JavaScript code into JSON format.

The bug occurs because the regular expressions and the `fix_kv` function do not handle all cases properly, leading to incorrect conversion of JavaScript code to JSON format.

To fix this bug, we can use a library like `demjson` or `json` in Python to directly convert the JavaScript code to JSON format. This will ensure that the conversion is handled accurately and efficiently without the need for custom regular expressions and handling different cases manually.

Here's the corrected code using the `json` library to fix the bug:

```python
import json

def js_to_json(code):
    # Using json.dumps to directly convert JavaScript code to JSON format
    return json.dumps(code)
```
