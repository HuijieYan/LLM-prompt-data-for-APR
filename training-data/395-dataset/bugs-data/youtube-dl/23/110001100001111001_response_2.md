The function `js_to_json` takes a string input `code` and applies regular expression replacements using the `fix_kv` function to convert a JavaScript-style object into a JSON-like dictionary. However, there are several issues with the current implementation of the `js_to_json` function, including the handling of multiline values and conditional replacements based on the matched content.

The `fix_kv` function currently seems to be handling individual matches incorrectly, resulting in misplaced or incorrectly formatted replacements. Additionally, the usage of regular expressions to match and transform JavaScript-style objects is error-prone and lacks proper handling for edge cases.

To fix the issues in the `js_to_json` function, it is recommended to use a dedicated parser for JavaScript-like objects, such as the `demjson` library or the built-in `json` library in Python, to ensure proper transformation of JavaScript-style objects to JSON-like dictionaries.

Here's an example of how the `js_to_json` function can be corrected using the `json` library:

```python
import json

def js_to_json(code):
    # Apply regular expression to remove comments
    cleaned_code = re.sub(r'/\*.*?\*/', '', code)
    
    # Attempt to convert cleaned code to JSON-like dictionary
    try:
        json_obj = json.loads(cleaned_code)
        return json.dumps(json_obj)
    except json.JSONDecodeError:
        # Handle JSON parsing errors
        return None
```

By using the `json` library, we ensure proper handling of edge cases and accurate transformation of JavaScript-style objects to JSON-like dictionaries. This approach avoids the need to manually handle individual matches and conditional replacements, mitigating potential errors and improving the overall reliability of the function.
