The issue with the buggy function is that it is not handling date formats in an optimal way. It uses a list of format expressions to attempt to parse the date string using `datetime.datetime.strptime()` and then convert to the format YYYYMMDD. However, it only stores the result if parsing is successful using the last expression that works, which can lead to incorrect results. Additionally, it doesn't handle dates with UTC offset at the end properly.

To fix the function, it can be improved by using dateutil.parser.parse to handle a wide variety of date formats including UTC offsets.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import dateutil.parser

def unified_strdate(date_str):
    """Return a string with the date in the format YYYYMMDD"""
    try:
        parsed_date = dateutil.parser.parse(date_str)
        return parsed_date.strftime('%Y%m%d')
    except ValueError:
        return None
```

The corrected function utilizes `dateutil.parser.parse` to handle a wide variety of date formats including UTC offsets. If the parsing is successful, it returns the date in the format YYYYMMDD. If parsing fails, it returns `None`.
