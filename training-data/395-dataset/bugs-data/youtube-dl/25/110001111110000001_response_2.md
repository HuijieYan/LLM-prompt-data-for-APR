The main issue here seems to be that the original `js_to_json` function is not properly handling the conversion of JSON data in the form of JavaScript objects. The error message specifically shows a failure in comparing the expected JSON with the JSON produced by the function.

Looking at the last failing test case:
```python
inp = '''{"duration": "00:01:07"}'''
self.assertEqual(js_to_json(inp), '''{"duration": "00:01:07"}''')
```
The assertion fails because the expected result is `{"duration": "00:01:07"}` but the generated result is `{"duration": 0}`.

The potential error location resides within the `js_to_json` function, particularly within the `fix_kv` nested function. It seems that the presence of the `INTEGER_TABLE` section and the subsequent checks on hex and octal numbers are converting valid string data to integers, leading to incorrect conversion of strings.

The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of cases involving string representations of integers. The `fix_kv` function is trying to interpret the strings as integers and modifying them inappropriately.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to properly handle the conversion and formatting of numbers and strings within the `js_to_json` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `js_to_json` function:

```python
import re

def js_to_json(code):
    return re.sub(r'''(?sx)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nurtbfx/\n]))*[^"\\]*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nurtbfx/\n]))*[^'\\]*'|
        /\*.*?\*/|,(?=\s*[\]}])|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*|
        \b(?:0[xX][0-9a-fA-F]+|0+[0-7]+)(?:\s*:)?|
        [0-9]+(?=\s*:)
        ''', fix_kv, code)

def fix_kv(m):
    v = m.group(0)
    if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
        return v
    elif v.startswith('/*') or v == ',':
        return ""

    if v[0] in ("'", '"'):
        v = re.sub(r'(?s)\\.|"', lambda m: {
            '"': '\\"',
            "\\'": "'",
            '\\\n': '',
            '\\x': '\\u00',
        }.get(m.group(0), m.group(0)), v[1:-1])

    if v.isdigit():
        return '"%s"' % v
    else:
        return v
``` 

In this corrected function, the `fix_kv` function accurately checks whether the string is a simple digit or a string, and handles different cases appropriately. The improper interpretation of string data as integers has been resolved, and the function should now produce correct JSON data from JavaScript object representation.
