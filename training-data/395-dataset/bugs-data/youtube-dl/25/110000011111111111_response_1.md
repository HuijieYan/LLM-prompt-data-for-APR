The issue with the code seems to be with the `fix_kv` function. It appears that the regular expression patterns in this function are not working correctly, leading to incorrect substitutions and ultimately causing the failures in the test cases.

The `fix_kv` function is responsible for handling various aspects of the input code, such as string manipulation, handling of special characters, and identification of integer values. It seems that these operations are not being performed correctly, leading to incorrect output.

One potential approach to fixing the bug in the `fix_kv` function would be to carefully review and revise the regular expressions used for pattern matching and substitution. Additionally, the conditional logic inside the function should be reviewed to ensure that it correctly handles different cases, such as boolean values, special characters, and integer values.

Here's the corrected code for the `js_to_json` function including the updated `fix_kv` function:

```python
import re
import json

def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
            return v
        elif v.startswith('/*') or v == ',':
            return ""

        if v[0] in ("'", '"'):
            v = re.sub(r'(?s)\\.|"', lambda m: {
                '"': '\\"',
                "\\'": "'",
                '\\\n': '',
                '\\x': '\\u00',
            }.get(m.group(0), m.group(0)), v[1:-1])

        INTEGER_TABLE = (
            (r'^0[xX][0-9a-fA-F]+', 16),
            (r'^0+[0-7]+', 8),
        )

        for regex, base in INTEGER_TABLE:
            im = re.match(regex, v)
            if im:
                i = int(im.group(0), base)
                return '"%d":' % i if v.endswith(':') else '%d' % i

        return '"%s"' % v

    result = re.sub(r'''(?sx)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nurtbfx/\n]))*[^"\\]*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nurtbfx/\n]))*[^'\\]*'|
        /\*.*?\*/|,(?=\s*[\]}])|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*|
        \b(?:0[xX][0-9a-fA-F]+|0+[0-7]+)(?:\s*:)?|
        [0-9]+(?=\s*:)
        ''', fix_kv, code)
    
    return result
```

This corrected code should address the issues with the `fix_kv` function and provide the expected output for the given test cases.
