The test case `self.assertFalse(match_str('is_live', {'is_live': False}))` is failing with the error message `AssertionError: True is not false`.

Based on the error message and the failed test case, the bug is most likely in the `_match_one` function, particularly in the logic surrounding the UNARY_OPERATORS.

The bug is occurring because the logic for the UNARY_OPERATORS is incorrectly processing the 'is_live' key with a value of False. The UNARY_OPERATORS should check for None or not None, but instead, it's behaving incorrectly when the value is False.

To fix the bug, the UNARY_OPERATORS should be updated to correctly handle the 'is_live' key with a value of False.

Here's the corrected code for the `match_str` function:

```python
# Corrected function
def _match_one(filter_part, dct):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    UNARY_OPERATORS = {
        '': lambda v: v is not None,
        '!': lambda v: v is None,
    }
    operator_rex = re.compile(r'''(?x)\s*
        (?P<op>%s)\s*(?P<key>[a-z_]+)
        \s*$
        ''' % '|'.join(map(re.escape, UNARY_OPERATORS.keys())))
    m = operator_rex.search(filter_part)
    if m:
        op = UNARY_OPERATORS[m.group('op')]
        actual_value = dct.get(m.group('key'))

        # Updated logic to handle False value correctly
        if m.group('op') == '':
            return op(actual_value)
        elif m.group('op') == '!':
            return not op(actual_value)

    # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)
```
