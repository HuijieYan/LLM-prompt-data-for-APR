The potential error location in the given function is that it does not import the required modules `re` and `operator`. This would lead to an error when the function is called due to missing modules. 

To fix the bug, the function needs to import the required modules `re` and `operator` at the beginning like this:

```python
import re
import operator
```

Corrected code for the given function:

```python
import re
import operator

def _match_one(filter_part, dct):
    COMPARISON_OPERATORS = {
        '<': operator.lt,
        '<=': operator.le,
        '>': operator.gt,
        '>=': operator.ge,
        '=': operator.eq,
        '!=': operator.ne,
    }
    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    ...
```
