The bug in the `match_str` function seems to be caused by incorrect handling of the inequality operator (`!=`). The function fails to correctly evaluate the expression containing the inequality operator.

1. The test case `self.assertFalse(match_str('is_live', {'is_live': False}))` fails, and the error message is `AssertionError: True is not false`. This suggests that the function is incorrectly evaluating the inequality operator and returning the wrong result.

2. The potential error location is in the logic related to handling the inequality operator (`!=`) in the `_match_one` function.

3. The bug is likely caused by the incorrect comparison logic for the inequality operator. The function fails to correctly handle the `!=` operator and returns incorrect results when evaluating the expressions containing this operator.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic related to handling the inequality operator (`!=`) to ensure that it correctly compares the values and returns the appropriate results.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import operator
import re
from youtube_dl.utils import (
    parse_filesize,
    compat_str,
)

def _match_one(filter_part, dct):
    COMPARISON_OPERATORS = {
        '<': operator.lt,
        '<=': operator.le,
        '>': operator.gt,
        '>=': operator.ge,
        '=': operator.eq,
        '!=': operator.ne,
    }

    # Existing code for handling the comparison operators

    if actual_value is None:
        return m.group('none_inclusive')
    return op(actual_value, comparison_value)

    UNARY_OPERATORS = {
        '': lambda v: v is not None,
        '!': lambda v: v is None,
    }
    
    # Existing code for handling the unary operators
    
    raise ValueError('Invalid filter part %r' % filter_part)

# The rest of the test and utility code remains unchanged.
```

This corrected code assumes that the `parse_filesize` and `compat_str` functions are available from `youtube_dl.utils`. The bug related to the incorrect evaluation of the inequality operator should be fixed with this updated logic.
