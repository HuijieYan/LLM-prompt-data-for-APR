The potential error in the code is with the handling of comparison and unary operations. There are multiple issues with parsing the filter_part and extracting the comparison and unary operators, as well as the keys and values to compare against in the input dictionary.

The reasons for the occurrence of the bug include:
1. Incorrect parsing of comparison and unary operations from the filter_part.
2. Incorrect extraction and processing of comparison values (integers, quoted strings, strings).

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Use proper regular expressions to parse the filter_part and extract the comparison and unary operators, keys, and values.
2. Ensure proper handling of different types of comparison values (integers, quoted strings, strings).

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import operator
import re

def _match_one(filter_part, dct):
    COMPARISON_OPERATORS = {
        '<': operator.lt,
        '<=': operator.le,
        '>': operator.gt,
        '>=': operator.ge,
        '=': operator.eq,
        '!=': operator.ne,
    }
    UNARY_OPERATORS = {
        '': lambda v: v is not None,
        '!': lambda v: v is None,
    }

    for op, func in COMPARISON_OPERATORS.items():
        if op in filter_part:
            key, value = filter_part.split(op)
            key = key.strip()
            value = value.strip()
            if value.endswith('?'):
                none_inclusive = True
                value = value[:-1].strip()
            else:
                none_inclusive = False

            actual_value = dct.get(key)
            if actual_value is not None and not isinstance(actual_value, str):
                try:
                    comparison_value = int(value)
                except ValueError:
                    comparison_value = parse_filesize(value)
                    if comparison_value is None:
                        comparison_value = parse_filesize(value + 'B')
                    if comparison_value is None:
                        raise ValueError(
                            'Invalid integer value %r in filter part %r' % (value, filter_part))
            else:
                comparison_value = value

            if actual_value is None:
                return none_inclusive
            return func(actual_value, comparison_value)

    for op, func in UNARY_OPERATORS.items():
        if op in filter_part:
            key = filter_part.replace(op, '').strip()
            actual_value = dct.get(key)
            return func(actual_value)

    raise ValueError('Invalid filter part %r' % filter_part)

def parse_filesize(s):
    # add parsing logic for file size strings
    pass
```

In the corrected code:
1. Proper regular expressions are not used, and instead, the split method is used to extract the key and value from the filter_part.
2. The parsing of comparison values has been modified to handle different data types properly.
3. Iteration over comparison and unary operators to find and process the relevant operation.
