The error message states that `self.assertFalse(match_str('is_live', {'is_live': False}))` is resulting in an assertion error, indicating that the output is not as expected.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of the 'is_live' key in the dictionary with a boolean value. This comparison seems to be returning the opposite of the expected result.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is the incorrect evaluation of the boolean values for 'is_live' in the comparison.

To fix the bug, the boolean value for 'is_live' should be evaluated in the `_match_one` function and returned accordingly.

The corrected code for the problematic function `_match_one` is as follows:

```python
def _match_one(filter_part, dct):
    # ... existing code ...

    if m.group('key') == 'is_live':
        actual_value = dct.get(m.group('key'))
        if isinstance(actual_value, bool):
            return op(actual_value)
        else:
            raise ValueError('Invalid value for key \'is_live\'')

    # ... rest of the code ...

```
