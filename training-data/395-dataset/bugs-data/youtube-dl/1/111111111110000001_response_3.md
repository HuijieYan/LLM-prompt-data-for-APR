The issue arises from the `match_str` function not being properly defined, whereas in the provided code the issue is in the `match_one` method. The error message `'is_live', {'is_live': True}` suggests that the function is incorrectly returning `True` when it should be `False`.

The bug is occurring because the `match_one` method is not correctly implementing the comparison logic based on the input key and value pairs. This is causing the method to return unexpected results.

To fix the issue, the method should correctly handle and compare the input key-value pairs according to the provided filter part. This may involve parsing the operator, key, and filter values, and then performing the corresponding comparison operation using the appropriate comparison operator.

Here's the corrected `match_one` function:

```python
import operator
import re
from youtube_dl.compat import compat_str

def _match_one(filter_part, dct):
    COMPARISON_OPERATORS = {
        '<': operator.lt,
        '<=': operator.le,
        '>': operator.gt,
        '>=': operator.ge,
        '=': operator.eq,
        '!=': operator.ne,
    }
    # Existing code for comparison operations

    # ... (previous part of the code remains the same)

    if actual_value is None:
        return op(actual_value, comparison_value)
    else:
        return False
```

With the above code change, the corrected `match_one` method should now return the correct comparison results based on the input key-value pairs and the filter part provided.
