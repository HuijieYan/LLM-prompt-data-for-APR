The potential error in the provided function is with the regular expressions and the parsing logic for the comparison and unary operators.

The function seems to be attempting to parse filter conditions in the format `key op value` and then apply the operator to the value in the dictionary `dct`.

One potential issue is that the regular expressions used to parse the filter conditions may not be correctly capturing the comparison and unary operators or the values for comparison.

The logic for parsing integer values and string values also seems to be mixed up, leading to potential errors in comparing the correct values.

A possible approach to fixing the bug would be to rewrite the regular expressions used to parse the filter conditions, ensuring that they correctly capture the comparison and unary operators as well as the values.

Another approach would be to separate the parsing logic for integer values and string values to ensure that the correct type of comparison is being performed.

Additionally, ensuring that the comparison_value is correctly parsed and matched with the actual_value in the dictionary would also be crucial to fixing the bug.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import operator
import re

def _match_one(filter_part, dct):
    COMPARISON_OPERATORS = {
        '<': operator.lt,
        '<=': operator.le,
        '>': operator.gt,
        '>=': operator.ge,
        '=': operator.eq,
        '!=': operator.ne,
    }
    UNARY_OPERATORS = {
        '': lambda v: v is not None,
        '!': lambda v: v is None,
    }

    for op in COMPARISON_OPERATORS.keys():
        if op in filter_part:
            key, value = filter_part.split(op)
            key = key.strip()
            value = value.strip()
            if op not in ('=', '!='):
                try:
                    comparison_value = int(value)
                except ValueError:
                    raise ValueError(
                        f'Invalid integer value {value} in filter part {filter_part}')
            else:
                comparison_value = value
            actual_value = dct.get(key)
            if actual_value is None:
                return True if op == '!=' else False
            return COMPARISON_OPERATORS[op](actual_value, comparison_value)

    for op in UNARY_OPERATORS.keys():
        if op in filter_part:
            key = filter_part.split(op)[1].strip()
            actual_value = dct.get(key)
            return UNARY_OPERATORS[op](actual_value)

    raise ValueError(f'Invalid filter part {filter_part}')
```

In the corrected code, the filter condition is split based on the comparison operators, and then based on the operator, the comparison or unary operation is performed on the dictionary value. This approach simplifies the parsing and comparison logic and fixes the potential issues in the original implementation.
