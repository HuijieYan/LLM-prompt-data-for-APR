Based on the error message, it seems that the issue is related to the `match_filter` function not correctly processing the filter conditions, which results in the wrong videos being returned.

The buggy function `_match_one` seems to be the potential location of the error.

The bug occurs because the comparison_value and actual_value are not being properly compared in the `_match_one` function. This leads to incorrect results being returned for the filter conditions.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison_value and actual_value are properly compared according to the filter conditions.

Here's the corrected code for the `_match_one` function:

```python
def _match_one(filter_part, dct):
    COMPARISON_OPERATORS = {
        '<': operator.lt,
        '<=': operator.le,
        '>': operator.gt,
        '>=': operator.ge,
        '=': operator.eq,
        '!=': operator.ne,
    }
    
    m = re.match(r'(?P<key>[a-z_]+)\s*(?P<op><|<=|>|>=|=|!=)\s*(?P<val>.+)', filter_part)
    if m:
        key = m.group('key')
        op = m.group('op')
        comparison_value = m.group('val')
        
        actual_value = dct.get(key)
        if actual_value is None:
            return False
        
        if op in COMPARISON_OPERATORS:
            return COMPARISON_OPERATORS[op](actual_value, comparison_value)
        else:
            raise ValueError(f'Invalid comparison operator: {op}')
    else:
        raise ValueError(f'Invalid filter format: {filter_part}')
```

In this corrected code, we use regular expression to parse the filter part and extract the key, comparison operator, and comparison value. Then we compare the actual value with the comparison value based on the operator.

This should fix the bug and ensure that the `match_filter` function works as expected.
