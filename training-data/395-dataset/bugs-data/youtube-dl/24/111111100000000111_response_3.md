The issue seems to be related to using the --match-filter for comparing the playlist_id, and it is always being skipped. 

1. The issue is likely related to the _match_one function, which is used to process the comparison operators and perform the comparison.

2. The bug is likely occurring because the comparison operators are not being applied correctly or the condition checks within the function are not working as intended.

3. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include reviewing the regular expressions used for parsing the comparison expressions, checking the logic for applying the comparison operators, and ensuring that the correct values are being compared.

Here's the corrected code for the _match_one function:

```python
import operator
import re

def parse_filesize(s):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def _match_one(filter_part, dct):
    COMPARISON_OPERATORS = {
        '<': operator.lt,
        '<=': operator.le,
        '>': operator.gt,
        '>=': operator.ge,
        '=': operator.eq,
        '!=': operator.ne,
    }
    m = re.match(r'(?P<key>[a-z_]+)\s*(?P<op>[<>=!]+)\s*(?P<value>[\w.]+)?', filter_part)
    if m:
        key = m.group('key')
        op = m.group('op')
        value = m.group('value')

        if key not in dct:
            return False

        actual_value = dct[key]
        if op in ('<', '<=', '>', '>=', '=', '!='):
            if value is not None:
                if op in ('=', '!='):
                    return actual_value == value if op == '=' else actual_value != value
                else:
                    return COMPARISON_OPERATORS[op](actual_value, value)
            else:
                return False

    raise ValueError('Invalid filter part %r' % filter_part)
```

This corrected code simplifies the regular expression and directly checks the keys and values for comparison, ensuring that the correct values are compared using the appropriate comparison operators.
