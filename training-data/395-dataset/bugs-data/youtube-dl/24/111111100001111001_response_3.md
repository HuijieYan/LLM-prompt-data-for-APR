The buggy function `_match_one` has multiple issues. It is trying to perform a comparison between the values using different operators such as '<', '<=', '>', '>=', '=', and '!='. The issues include incorrect value types for comparison_value and actual_value, as well as possible incorrect matches and comparisons with the dictionary values.

To fix these issues, we need to ensure that the correct comparison values are used based on the type of the provided value and also handle the potential cases where the value is not present in the dictionary properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_match_one` function:

```python
import operator
import re

def _match_one(filter_part, dct):
    COMPARISON_OPERATORS = {
        '<': operator.lt,
        '<=': operator.le,
        '>': operator.gt,
        '>=': operator.ge,
        '=': operator.eq,
        '!=': operator.ne,
    }
    operator_rex = re.compile(r'''(?x)\s*
        (?P<key>[a-z_]+)
        \s*(?P<op>(?:<|<=|>|>=|=|!=))(?P<none_inclusive>\s*\?)?\s*
        (?P<value>(?:".*?"|'.*?'|[^'"][^\s]*))\s*$''')
    m = operator_rex.search(filter_part)
    if m:
        op = COMPARISON_OPERATORS[m.group('op')]
        comparison_value = m.group('value').strip('\'"')
        actual_value = dct.get(m.group('key'))
        if actual_value is None:
            return m.group('none_inclusive')
        return op(actual_value, comparison_value)

    UNARY_OPERATORS = {
        '': lambda v: v is not None,
        '!': lambda v: v is None,
    }
    operator_rex = re.compile(r'''(?x)\s*
        (?P<op>%s)\s*(?P<key>[a-z_]+)
        \s*$''' % '|'.join(map(re.escape, UNARY_OPERATORS.keys())))
    m = operator_rex.search(filter_part)
    if m:
        op = UNARY_OPERATORS[m.group('op')]
        actual_value = dct.get(m.group('key'))
        return op(actual_value)

    raise ValueError('Invalid filter part %r' % filter_part)
```

In the corrected code, the function matches the filter part with a regular expression, extracts the key, operator, and value, and then based on the operator, it performs the comparison between `actual_value` from the dictionary and `comparison_value`. It also handles the cases where the dictionary value might be missing and returns `none_inclusive` accordingly.

This corrected code should address the issues and improve the functionality of the `_match_one` function.
