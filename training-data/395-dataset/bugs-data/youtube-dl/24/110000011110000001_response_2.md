The error message "AssertionError: Lists differ: [] != ['1']" is from the test function 'test_match_filter'. It indicates that the expected result should have been an empty list, but the actual result was a list containing '1'.

The potential error location within the '_match_one' function is likely in the 'get_videos' function, particularly in the way it processes the filter_ argument.

The bug in the code may be caused by an issue in parsing and applying the filter conditions to filter the videos. The function '_match_one' is responsible for matching the filter conditions with the videos, and it seems that the implementation of this function is incorrect.

To fix the bug, the way the filter conditions are parsed and applied to the videos needs to be revised. The implementation of the '_match_one' function should be corrected to properly interpret and apply the filter conditions to the videos.

Here's the corrected code for the '_match_one' function:

```python
import operator
import re

def _match_one(filter_part, dct):
    COMPARISON_OPERATORS = {
        '<': operator.lt,
        '<=': operator.le,
        '>': operator.gt,
        '>=': operator.ge,
        '=': operator.eq,
        '!=': operator.ne,
    }

    if '=' in filter_part:
        key, value = filter_part.split('=')
        return dct.get(key) == value

    if '<' in filter_part:
        key, value = filter_part.split('<')
        return dct.get(key) < value

    if '>' in filter_part:
        key, value = filter_part.split('>')
        return dct.get(key) > value

    raise ValueError('Invalid filter part %r' % filter_part)
```

This corrected implementation should properly handle the filter conditions and apply them to the videos to filter out the desired results.
