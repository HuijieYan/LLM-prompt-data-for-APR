The bug occurs in the `_match_entry` function due to issues in the comparison of filter conditions with the actual values. The comparison may be returning incorrect results, leading to videos being skipped or included incorrectly.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic in the `_match_entry` function needs to be corrected. This can be achieved by revisiting the comparison conditions and ensuring that they are correctly evaluated against the actual values. Additionally, the data types of the values being compared should be handled appropriately to avoid any unexpected behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the `_match_entry` function:

```python
def _match_one(filter_part, dct):
    COMPARISON_OPERATORS = {
        '<': operator.lt,
        '<=': operator.le,
        '>': operator.gt,
        '>=': operator.ge,
        '=': operator.eq,
        '!=': operator.ne,
    }
    parts = filter_part.split()
    key = parts[0]
    op = parts[1]
    val = parts[2]
    
    actual_value = dct.get(key)
    
    if actual_value is None:
        return False
    
    if op in ('=', '!='):
        if op == '=':
            return actual_value == val
        else:
            return actual_value != val
    else:
        try:
            comparison_value = int(val)
        except ValueError:
            comparison_value = parse_filesize(val)
        
        if comparison_value is None:
            raise ValueError('Invalid value for comparison: %s' % val)
        
        return COMPARISON_OPERATORS[op](actual_value, comparison_value)
```

By using this corrected code, the `_match_entry` function should now correctly evaluate the filter conditions against the actual values in the `dct` dictionary, thus resolving the issue with videos being skipped or included incorrectly.
