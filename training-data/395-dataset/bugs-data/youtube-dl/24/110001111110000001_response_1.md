The test function `test_match_filter` is designed to test the functionality of the `_match_one` function. The error message indicates that there is an assertion error when comparing the expected result of a filter operation with the actual result.

Looking at the test case where the error occurred:
- `f = match_filter_func('playlist_id = 42')`
- `res = get_videos(f)`
- `self.assertEqual(res, ['1'])`

The error message indicates that the `res` list is `['1']` instead of `[]`, which is the expected result. This suggests that the filter operation for 'playlist_id = 42' is not working as expected.

The potential error location within the `_match_one` function is likely in the logic responsible for handling the filter conditions, specifically for the 'playlist_id' key.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be incorrect comparison or conditional logic within the `_match_one` function when processing the 'playlist_id' filter.

A possible approach for fixing the bug would be to review the conditional logic and comparison operations within the `_match_one` function to ensure that it correctly handles the filter conditions, especially for the 'playlist_id' key.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _match_one(filter_part, dct):
    if isinstance(filter_part, str):
        filter_part = filter_part.strip()

    # ... (other parts of the function)
    query = filter_part

    # Unary operation
    if query.startswith('!') and query[1:].strip():
        key = query[1:].strip()
        return key not in dct or dct[key] is None

    # Comparison operation
    key_match = re.match(r'(?P<key>%s)(?P<comparison>.+)' % '|'.join(dct.keys()), query)
    if key_match:
        key = key_match.group('key')
        comparison = key_match.group('comparison')
        
        if comparison.startswith('>='):
            return dct.get(key, 0) >= parse_size(comparison[2:])
        elif comparison.startswith('<='):
            return dct.get(key, 0) <= parse_size(comparison[2:])
        elif comparison.startswith('!='):
            return dct.get(key) != parse_size(comparison[2:])
        elif comparison.startswith('>') and comparison[1:].strip():
            return dct.get(key, 0) > parse_size(comparison[1:])
        elif comparison.startswith('<') and comparison[1:].strip():
            return dct.get(key, 0) < parse_size(comparison[1:])
        elif comparison.startswith('=') and comparison[1:].strip():
            return dct.get(key, '') == comparison[1:].strip()

    raise ValueError('Invalid filter part %r' % filter_part)
```

In the corrected code, the comparison and unary operations are handled separately, and the comparison logic is updated to accurately compare the values with the given conditions. Additionally, a `parse_size` function is used to handle the file size comparisons.
