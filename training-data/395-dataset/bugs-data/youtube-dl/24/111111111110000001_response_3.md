The error message is an AssertionError raised in the `test_match_filter` function at line 657. The test is failing because the expected result is `['1']` but the actual result is `['1']`. This indicates that the filtering logic is not working as expected and it returned an empty list instead of the expected result.

The potential error location within the `get_videos` function, which uses the `match_filter_func` function to filter the videos based on different criteria.

The bug is likely occurring because the `_match_one` function, which is supposed to filter the videos based on the given criteria, is not functioning correctly. This function should parse the filter criteria provided in the `match_filter_func` function and compare it with the video's attributes. It seems like the comparison function is not appropriately handling the conditions specified in the filter criteria.

To fix this bug:
- The `_match_one` function needs to be carefully reviewed and corrected to ensure that it correctly parses the filter criteria and compares it with the video attributes.
- The comparison logic for different operators such as `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`, `=`, and `!=` needs to be reviewed and corrected.
- The handling of the comparison between string values, integer values, and file size values needs to be correctly implemented.

The corrected code for the problematic `_match_one` function is provided below:

```python
import operator
import re

def parse_filesize(s):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def _match_one(filter_part, dct):
    COMPARISON_OPERATORS = {
        '<': operator.lt,
        '<=': operator.le,
        '>': operator.gt,
        '>=': operator.ge,
        '=': operator.eq,
        '!=': operator.ne,
    }
    match = re.match(r'\s*(?P<key>[a-z_]+)\s*(?P<op><=|>=|<|>|=|!=|=\?)\s*(?P<value>[a-zA-Z0-9.]+)\s*$', filter_part)
    if match:
        key = match.group('key')
        op = match.group('op')
        value = match.group('value')
        actual_value = dct.get(key)

        if actual_value is None:
            return op == '=?'

        if op in ('=', '!='):
            return (actual_value == value) if op == '=' else (actual_value != value)
        
        try:
            comparison_value = int(value)
        except ValueError:
            comparison_value = parse_filesize(value)
            if comparison_value is None:
                comparison_value = parse_filesize(value + 'B')
            if comparison_value is None:
                raise ValueError(
                    'Invalid integer value %r in filter part %r' % (value, filter_part))
        
        return COMPARISON_OPERATORS[op](actual_value, comparison_value)

    raise ValueError('Invalid filter part %r' % filter_part)
```

This corrected code for `_match_one` function improves the parsing of the filter and the application of comparison operators to accurately filter the videos based on the provided criteria.
