Description of your issue, suggested solution and other information
I am trying to make a filter using playlist_id. Example:

youtube-dl -v --match-filter "playlist_id=504183" -o '%(playlist_index)s - %(title)s.%(ext)s' "https://www.lynda.com/Swift-tutorials/AVFoundation-Essentials-iOS-Swift/504183-2.html\"

But it fails. youtube-dl always skipping event the playlist_id is 504183 for the given URL. I retrieved the JSON file and only thing that I noticed that the playlist_id is a string. Am I writing wrong the comparison?
```
