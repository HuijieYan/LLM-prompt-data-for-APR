The error message indicates that the test case is failing because the expected result is `['1']`, but the actual result is an empty list `[]`.

Upon analysis, the potential error location within the problematic function seems to be in the `_match_one` function. It seems that the function is not returning the correct results for the filter conditions provided.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug could be related to how the comparison and matching operations are implemented within the `_match_one` function. It seems that the function may not be correctly interpreting the filter conditions and making the comparisons with the values in the dictionary.

Potential approaches for fixing the bug include:
- Revisiting the logic for parsing and interpreting the filter conditions.
- Ensuring that the comparisons between the filter conditions and the values in the dictionary are handled correctly.
- Verifying the handling of different types of comparison values (e.g., strings, integers, file sizes).

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import operator
import re

def parse_filesize(s):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def _match_one(filter_part, dct):
    COMPARISON_OPERATORS = {
        '<': operator.lt,
        '<=': operator.le,
        '>': operator.gt,
        '>=': operator.ge,
        '=': operator.eq,
        '!=': operator.ne,
    }

    m = re.match(r'(?P<key>[a-z_]+)\s*(?P<op>[<>=!]+)(\??)\s*(?P<val>[a-zA-Z0-9.]+)', filter_part)
    if m:
        key = m.group('key')
        op = m.group('op')
        val = m.group('val')
        actual_value = dct.get(key)

        if actual_value is not None:
            if op in COMPARISON_OPERATORS:
                comparison_func = COMPARISON_OPERATORS[op]
                if isinstance(actual_value, str) and isinstance(val, str):
                    result = comparison_func(actual_value, val)
                else:
                    try:
                        int_val = int(val)
                        result = comparison_func(actual_value, int_val)
                    except ValueError:
                        parse_val = parse_filesize(val)
                        if parse_val is not None:
                            result = comparison_func(actual_value, parse_val)
                        else:
                            raise ValueError(f'Invalid comparison value: {val}')
                return result

        elif m.group('none_inclusive') is not None:
            return True

    raise ValueError('Invalid filter part %r' % filter_part)
```
In this corrected code, the function `re.match` is used to match the key, operator, and value parts of the filter condition. Then, based on the comparison operator and the types of the actual value and the comparison value, the function performs the corresponding comparison using `COMPARISON_OPERATORS` dictionary and returns the result. If a valid result is not obtained, it raises a `ValueError` with an appropriate error message.
