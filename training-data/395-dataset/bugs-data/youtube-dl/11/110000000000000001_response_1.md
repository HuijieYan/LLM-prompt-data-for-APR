Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is the usage of the `re` module without importing it in the code. This will result in a NameError as `re` is not defined within the function.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug is occurring because the re module is being used without importing it. This results in a NameError when the function is called, as the 're' module is not defined or imported within the function.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Import the `re` module at the beginning of the code.
2. Use string methods like replace instead of using regular expressions.

Corrected Code:
```python
import re

def str_to_int(int_str):
    """ A more relaxed version of int_or_none """
    if int_str is None:
        return None
    int_str = int_str.replace(',', '').replace('.', '').replace('+', '')
    return int(int_str)
```
