Potential error location: 
The error is likely to be in the line `int_str = re.sub(r'[,\.\+]', '', int_str)` where the function is trying to remove commas, periods, and plus signs from the input `int_str`.

Reason behind the bug:
The buggy code is using the `re` module (presumably `import re` is missing) to perform a regular expression substitution, but the `re` module has not been imported in the code. Additionally, the regular expression pattern is incorrect, as it's missing the `re` module. As a result, the `re.sub` function is not properly removing the commas, periods, and plus signs from the `int_str`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Import the `re` module at the beginning of the code using `import re`.
2. Correct the regular expression pattern by adding `re` before `sub`, and escaping the characters properly.

Corrected code:
```python
import re

def str_to_int(int_str):
    """ A more relaxed version of int_or_none """
    if int_str is None:
        return None
    int_str = re.sub(r'[,\.+]', '', int_str)
    return int(int_str)
```
