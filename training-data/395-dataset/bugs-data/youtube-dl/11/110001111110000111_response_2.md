Potential error location within the problematic function: 
The error seems to be occurring in the line int_str = re.sub(r'[,\.\+]', '', int_str). This line is trying to remove any commas, periods, or plus signs from the input int_str.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The error message indicates a TypeError, which means that the function re.sub is expecting a string or bytes-like object, but it is receiving an integer instead.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
One approach to fixing the bug is to convert the input int_str to a string before applying the re.sub function to it.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def str_to_int(int_str):
    """ A more relaxed version of int_or_none """
    if int_str is None:
        return None
    int_str = re.sub(r'[,\.\+]', '', str(int_str))
    return int(int_str)
```
