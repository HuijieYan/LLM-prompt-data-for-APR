The error message indicates a TypeError in the re.sub() function call inside the str_to_int function. The error occurs because the input to the str_to_int function is not a string, and therefore the re.sub() function cannot operate on it.

Based on the error message, we can see that the problematic line is:
```python
int_str = re.sub(r'[,\.\+]', '', int_str)
```

The reason for the bug is that the re.sub() function is expecting a string as input for the pattern replacement, but in the test case, an integer (523) is provided as input to the str_to_int function.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the input to the str_to_int function is always a string. One approach is to convert the input to a string before processing it using re.sub(). We can use the str() function to convert the input to a string.

Here's the corrected code for the str_to_int function:
```python
import re

def str_to_int(int_str):
    """ A more relaxed version of int_or_none """
    if int_str is None:
        return None
    int_str = re.sub(r'[,\.\+]', '', str(int_str))
    return int(int_str)
```

With this correction, we ensure that the input to the re.sub() function is always a string, preventing the TypeError that occurred in the original implementation.
