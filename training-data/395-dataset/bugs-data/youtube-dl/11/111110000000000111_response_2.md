Potential error location: The error is likely occurring due to the use of the 're' module without importing it. 

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The 're' module is used for regular expressions and it needs to be imported before it can be used. 

Approach for fixing the bug: Import the 're' module at the beginning of the function.

Corrected code:

```python
import re

def str_to_int(int_str):
    """ A more relaxed version of int_or_none """
    if int_str is None:
        return None
    int_str = re.sub(r'[,\.\+]', '', int_str)
    return int(int_str)
```
