The error message indicates a TypeError in the re.sub() function, where it is expected to receive a string or bytes-like object but received an integer instead.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the re.sub() function call, where the int_str (input) is expected to be a string but it is not being validated before being used.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the input validation is not being done properly, leading to the function trying to apply re.sub() on an integer input.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the input is a string before applying re.sub().

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re

def str_to_int(int_str):
    """ A more relaxed version of int_or_none """
    if int_str is None:
        return int_str
    if not isinstance(int_str, str):
        int_str = str(int_str)
    int_str = re.sub(r'[,\.\+]', '', int_str)
    return int(int_str)
```

In the corrected code, we added a validation check to ensure that the input is a string before applying re.sub(). If the input is not a string, we convert it to a string before proceeding with the substitution. This should prevent the TypeError that was occurring in the previous version of the function.
