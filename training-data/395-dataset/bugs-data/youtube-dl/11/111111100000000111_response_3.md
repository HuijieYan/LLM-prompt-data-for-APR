Potential Error Location: The potential error is in the `re.sub` function, which is used to remove commas, periods, and plus signs from the input string `int_str`. However, the `re` module has not been imported in the code.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug: The bug occurred because the `re` module was not imported before using the `re.sub` function.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: The bug can be fixed by importing the `re` module and then using the `re.sub` function to remove commas, periods, and plus signs from the input string `int_str`.

Corrected Code:
```python
import re

def str_to_int(int_str):
    """ A more relaxed version of int_or_none """
    if int_str is None:
        return None
    int_str = re.sub(r'[,\.\+]', '', int_str)
    return int(int_str)
```
