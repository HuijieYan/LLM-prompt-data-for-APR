The error message indicates a TypeError occurring at line 3524 in the file utils.py. It is caused by the `re.sub` function trying to substitute a pattern in a non-string input, specifically with the input '523'.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `int_str = re.sub(r'[,\.\+]', '', int_str)` line. The function `re.sub` is used to replace any occurrence of ',' or '.' with an empty string in the input `int_str`. However, it is assuming that the input is always a string.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `re.sub` function expects the input to be a string or bytes-like object, but in the test case, the input '523' is an integer, not a string.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the input `int_str` is always a string. If it is not a string, it should be converted to a string before applying the `re.sub` function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def str_to_int(int_str):
    """ A more relaxed version of int_or_none """
    if int_str is None:
        return None
    int_str = str(int_str)  # convert to string if not already a string
    int_str = re.sub(r'[,\.\+]', '', int_str)
    return int(int_str)
```

With this correction, the function will first ensure that the input `int_str` is a string, and then remove any commas, periods, or plus signs before converting the modified string to an integer.
