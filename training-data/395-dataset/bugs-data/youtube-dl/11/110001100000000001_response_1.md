Potential error location: The use of the re.sub() method without importing the re module suggests that 're' module was not imported.

Reason for the bug: The re.sub() method is used to replace occurrences of a pattern in a string with another string. But without importing the 're' module, the method will not be recognized and will cause an error.

Approaches for fixing the bug: The 're' module needs to be imported before using the re.sub() method.

Corrected code:

```python
import re

def str_to_int(int_str):
    """ A more relaxed version of int_or_none """
    if int_str is None:
        return None
    int_str = re.sub(r'[,\.\+]', '', int_str)
    return int(int_str)
```
