Potential error location: The re module is used to remove commas, periods, and plus signs from the input string, but the re module has not been imported in the function.

Reason for the bug: The code is using the re module to perform string manipulation, but the module has not been imported, so the function will throw an error when trying to use re.sub.

Approach for fixing the bug: Import the re module at the beginning of the function so that the re.sub function can be used to remove unwanted characters from the input string.

Corrected code:

```python
import re

def str_to_int(int_str):
    """ A more relaxed version of int_or_none """
    if int_str is None:
        return None
    int_str = re.sub(r'[,\.\+]', '', int_str)
    return int(int_str)
```
