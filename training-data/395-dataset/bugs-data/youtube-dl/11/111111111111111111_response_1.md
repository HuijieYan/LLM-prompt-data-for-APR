The test case `test_str_to_int(523), 523` is causing an error due to the `int_str` variable being of type `int` instead of `str`. This is because the `str_to_int` function is assuming that the input will always be of type `str` and performing a regular expression substitution on it, which fails when the input is an integer.

The reason for the bug is that the function `str_to_int` is assuming the input to always be a string, but it can also be an integer as shown in the test case. The function then tries to perform a regular expression substitution on an integer, which results in the error.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `str_to_int` function to first check the type of the input parameter. If it is already an integer, it should return the input as it is. If the input is a string, then the regular expression substitution should be performed to remove commas, periods, and plus signs before converting it to an integer.

Here's the corrected code for the `str_to_int` function:

```python
import re

def str_to_int(int_str):
    """ A more relaxed version of int_or_none """
    if int_str is None:
        return None
    if isinstance(int_str, int):
        return int_str
    int_str = re.sub(r'[,\.\+]', '', str(int_str))
    return int(int_str)
```

With this modification, the function will handle both string and integer input values correctly.
