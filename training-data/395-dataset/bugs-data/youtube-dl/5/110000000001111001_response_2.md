The potential error in the function is with the line `dt = datetime.datetime.strptime(date_str, expression) - timezone + pm_delta`. The error occurs because `timezone` is of type `datetime.timedelta` and cannot be subtracted from or added to a `datetime` object. 

The function is trying to handle timezones and PM/AM conversions, but it's doing this in an overly complex way. It's using regular expressions to extract the timezone and to remove AM/PM from the date string, and it's using timedelta to add the PM offset. This complexity is likely the cause of the bug.

A simpler approach to handling timezones and AM/PM conversion is to use the `pytz` library, which provides support for timezones and allows for simple conversion between different timezones. 

Here is the corrected code for the `unified_timestamp` function:

```python
import pytz
from datetime import datetime

def unified_timestamp(date_str, day_first=True, timezone='UTC'):
    if date_str is None:
        return None

    try:
        timezone = pytz.timezone(timezone)
        dt = datetime.strptime(date_str, '%I:%M:%S %p')
        dt = timezone.localize(dt)
        return dt.timestamp()
    except ValueError:
        pass

    date_formats = ['%B %d, %Y', '%m/%d/%Y', '%b %d, %Y', '%Y/%m/%d', '%Y %m %d', '%Y-%m-%d']
    for expression in date_formats:
        try:
            dt = datetime.strptime(date_str, expression)
            return dt.timestamp()
        except ValueError:
            pass

    return None
```

In the corrected code, we use `pytz.timezone` to set the desired timezone. We then use `datetime.strptime` to convert the string to a `datetime` object and `timezone.localize(dt)` to assign the desired timezone to the datetime object. Finally, we return the timestamp of the datetime object. If the initial format matching fails, we use a list of date formats to try and parse the date string. If all attempts fail, we return `None`.
