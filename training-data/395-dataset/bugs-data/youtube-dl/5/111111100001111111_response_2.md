The issue with the `unified_timestamp` function is that the method of calculating the `pm_delta` and `dt` variables doesn't take into account the possibility of the day and month being specified in different orders in the date string. This is particularly relevant because the `day_first` parameter is implemented inconsistently. Additionally, there is an issue with the `pm_delta` calculation for the pm hours.

To fix the buggy function, we can modify the `unified_timestamp` method by taking the `day_first` parameter into consideration and adjusting the `pm_delta` calculation to include both the 'PM' and 'AM' cases. 

Below is the corrected code for the `unified_timestamp` function:

```python
import datetime
import re
import calendar
import email.utils

def unified_timestamp(date_str, day_first=True):
    if date_str is None:
        return None

    date_str = date_str.replace(',', ' ')

    pm_match = re.search(r'(?i)(\d{1,2}):(\d{2}):(\d{2})\s*(AM|PM)', date_str)
    if pm_match:
        hours = int(pm_match.group(1))
        pm_delta = datetime.timedelta(hours=12) if pm_match.group(4).upper() == 'PM' else datetime.timedelta(0)
    else:
        pm_delta = datetime.timedelta(0)
        hours = 0

    if day_first:
        for expression in ['%d/%m/%Y %H:%M:%S', '%Y/%m/%d %H:%M:%S']:
            try:
                dt = datetime.datetime.strptime(date_str, expression) + pm_delta
                return calendar.timegm(dt.timetuple())
            except ValueError:
                pass
    else:
        for expression in ['%m/%d/%Y %H:%M:%S', '%Y/%d/%m %H:%M:%S']:
            try:
                dt = datetime.datetime.strptime(date_str, expression) + pm_delta
                return calendar.timegm(dt.timetuple())
            except ValueError:
                pass
    timetuple = email.utils.parsedate_tz(date_str)
    if timetuple:
        return calendar.timegm(timetuple)

    return None
```

In the corrected code, we have explicitly extracted the hours from the date string and checked if it is a PM time. We have also added checks for different date formats based on the `day_first` parameter, allowing flexibility in parsing different date formats.
