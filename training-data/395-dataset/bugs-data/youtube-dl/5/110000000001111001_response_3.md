The potential error in the buggy function is located in the following line:

```python
dt = datetime.datetime.strptime(date_str, expression) - timezone + pm_delta
```

The bug occurs due to the datetime arithmetic being performed incorrectly. The `datetime.strptime` function returns a datetime object, and the subsequent operations are intended to change the timezone and add or subtract 12 hours for PM/AM adjustments. However, the arithmetic operations are not correctly manipulating the datetime object.

To fix the bug, the correct approach would be to use the `pytz` library to handle the timezones and utilize the `datetime.combine` method to add or subtract the PM delta. Additionally, the `date_formats` function, which is not provided, should be reviewed to ensure it covers all applicable date formats.

Here's the corrected code for the function, which includes the required imports and adjustments:

```python
import pytz
import re
import datetime
import calendar

def unified_timestamp(date_str, day_first=True):
    if date_str is None:
        return None

    date_str = date_str.replace(',', ' ')

    pm_delta = datetime.timedelta(hours=12 if re.search(r'(?i)PM', date_str) else 0)
    timezone, date_str = extract_timezone(date_str)

    # Remove AM/PM + timezone
    date_str = re.sub(r'(?i)\s*(?:AM|PM)(?:\s+[A-Z]+)?', '', date_str)

    for expression in date_formats(day_first):
        try:
            dt = datetime.datetime.strptime(date_str, expression)
            dt = timezone.localize(dt, is_dst=None)  # Add timezone info
            dt = dt + pm_delta  # Adjust for AM/PM
            return calendar.timegm(dt.utctimetuple())
        except ValueError:
            pass
    timetuple = email.utils.parsedate_tz(date_str)
    if timetuple:
        return calendar.timegm(timetuple.timetuple())
```

In this corrected code:
1. The `pytz` library is used to handle timezones. The `timezone` object, should be an instance of `pytz.timezone` that represents the extracted timezone.
2. The `localize` method of the `timezone` object is utilized to add timezone information to the `datetime` object.
3. The `utctimetuple` method is used to retrieve a UTC representation of the datetime, which is then converted to a timestamp using `calendar.timegm`.

This approach would ensure that the datetime arithmetic is performed correctly and the timezone information is handled appropriately.
