The error is occurring in the `uppercase_escape` function in the `youtube_dl/utils.py` file. The error message suggests that the function is attempting to use the `decode` method on a string object, which is not supported in Python 3.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code was written for Python 2, where the `decode` method was used to decode byte strings to Unicode strings. However, in Python 3, strings are by default Unicode, so the `decode` method is no longer available on string objects.

To fix the bug, the `encode` method can be used to convert Unicode strings to byte strings, and the `decode` method can be removed.

Here's the corrected code for the `uppercase_escape` function:

```python
import re

def uppercase_escape(s):
    return re.sub(
        r'\\U[0-9a-fA-F]{8}',
        lambda m: bytes.fromhex(m.group(0)[2:]).decode('utf-32'), s)
```

In the corrected code, the `bytes.fromhex` method is used to convert the matched hexadecimal string to a byte string, and then the `decode` method is used to decode the byte string to a Unicode string. This approach is compatible with both Python 2 and Python 3 and should fix the bug.
