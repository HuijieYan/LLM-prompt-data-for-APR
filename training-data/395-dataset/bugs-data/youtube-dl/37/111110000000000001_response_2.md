Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the given code is the 'decode' method used in the lambda function inside the re.sub. The 'decode' method is not applicable to the string object.

Reason for the Bug:
The 'decode' method is not applicable to the string object. It appears that the intention is to use 'unicode-escape' to decode the matched string, but the implementation is incorrect.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
Replace the lambda function with a custom function that utilizes the 'unicode-escape' decoding correctly.

Corrected Code:
```python
import re

def uppercase_escape(s):
    def replace_unicode(m):
        return bytes(m.group(0), 'utf-8').decode('unicode-escape')
    
    return re.sub(
        r'\\U[0-9a-fA-F]{8}',
        replace_unicode, s)
```
