The error "AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'decode'" is occurring because the `.decode()` method is being called on the string object `m.group(0)`. However, the `.decode()` method is only available to byte objects, not string objects.

To fix this bug, we need to use the `codecs` module to decode the unicode escape sequence in the string.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re
import codecs

def uppercase_escape(s):
    return re.sub(
        r'\\U[0-9a-fA-F]{8}',
        lambda m: codecs.decode(m.group(0), 'unicode-escape'), s)
```

With this corrected code, the function `uppercase_escape` should now work as expected.
