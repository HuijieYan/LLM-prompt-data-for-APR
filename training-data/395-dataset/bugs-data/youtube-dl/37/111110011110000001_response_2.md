The function `uppercase_escape` is intended to convert Unicode escape sequences (e.g., '\U0001d550') to the corresponding Unicode character (e.g., 'ùïê'). However, the code contains a bug due to the usage of the `decode` method.

The reason behind the bug is that the `decode` method is not available for strings in Python 3. The `decode` method is used to convert a byte-like object to a string, but since `m.group(0)` is already a string, calling `decode` on it causes the 'AttributeError' as shown in the error message.

To fix this bug, we need to use the `codecs` module to properly decode the Unicode escape sequences. The corrected code is as follows:

```python
import re
import codecs

def uppercase_escape(s):
    return re.sub(
        r'\\U[0-9a-fA-F]{8}',
        lambda m: codecs.decode(m.group(0), 'unicode-escape'), s)
```

With this corrected code, the `codecs.decode` method is used to properly decode the Unicode escape sequences, resolving the issue.
