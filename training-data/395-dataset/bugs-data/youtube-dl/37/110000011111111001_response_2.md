The error occurs within the `uppercase_escape` function. The `re.sub` function with the lambda expression is trying to use `.decode('unicode-escape')` on the matched string, but in Python 3, strings do not have a `decode` method as in Python 2. Therefore, this lambda function is causing an `AttributeError` because there is no `decode` method for string objects.

To fix this bug, we can use the `codecs` module to decode the unicode escape sequence.

Here's the corrected code for the `uppercase_escape` function:

```python
import re
import codecs

def uppercase_escape(s):
    return re.sub(
        r'\\U[0-9a-fA-F]{8}',
        lambda m: codecs.decode(m.group(0), 'unicode-escape'), s)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now work as expected, and the error in the test function should be resolved.
