The error is occurring in the `uppercase_escape` function on the line `lambda m: m.group(0).decode('unicode-escape'), s)`. The error message indicates that a 'str' object has no attribute 'decode', which suggests that the `decode` method is being called on a string, which is not possible in Python 3.

The bug occurs because the `decode` method is being called in the `lambda` function with the argument `s`, which is a string. In Python 3, the `decode` method is used to convert bytes to a string, not to decode escape sequences in a string.

To fix the bug, the `lambda` function should be modified to use the `codecs` module to decode the escape sequences in the string `s`. The `re` module can be used to find the escape sequences and then the `codecs` module can be used to decode them.

```python
import re
import codecs

def uppercase_escape(s):
    def replace_match(m):
        return codecs.decode(m.group(0), 'unicode-escape')

    return re.sub(
        r'\\U[0-9a-fA-F]{8}',
        replace_match,
        s)
```

The corrected function uses the `codecs.decode` method in a separate function `replace_match` to decode the escape sequences found by the `re.sub` method. This will properly decode the escape sequences in the input string `s`, resolving the bug.
