The buggy function is attempting to replace Unicode escape sequences with their corresponding Unicode characters. However, the function is missing the necessary import statement for the 're' module.

Additionally, the lambda function is attempting to use the 'decode' method, which is not necessary and would cause an AttributeError.

To fix the function, we need to import the 're' module and remove the unnecessary 'decode' method from the lambda function.

```python
import re

def uppercase_escape(s):
    return re.sub(
        r'\\U[0-9a-fA-F]{8}',
        lambda m: chr(int(m.group(0)[2:], 16)), s)
```
