The potential error in the given function is the use of the `decode` method, which is not a valid method for strings in Python 3.

The function `uppercase_escape` tries to replace the Unicode escape sequence `\\U[0-9a-fA-F]{8}` with the corresponding Unicode character using the `decode` method. However, the `decode` method is used for bytes-like objects, not for strings.

To fix this issue, we can use the `codecs` module to decode the Unicode escape sequence.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re
import codecs

def uppercase_escape(s):
    return re.sub(
        r'\\U[0-9a-fA-F]{8}',
        lambda m: codecs.decode(m.group(0), 'unicode-escape'), s)
```
