The buggy function `uppercase_escape` is trying to replace any occurrences of the pattern `r'\\U[0-9a-fA-F]{8}'` with the corresponding Unicode character. However, the function is using `decode('unicode-escape')` method on the matched string, which is causing the error.

The error is occurring because the `decode` method is being used on the matched string, but the matched string is not a byte string, so it cannot be decoded.

To fix this bug, we should use the `codecs` module to properly decode the Unicode characters.

Here's the corrected code for the `uppercase_escape` function:

```python
import re
import codecs

def uppercase_escape(s):
    return re.sub(
        r'\\U[0-9a-fA-F]{8}',
        lambda m: codecs.decode(m.group(0), 'unicode-escape'), s)
```

This corrected code uses the `codecs.decode` method to properly decode the Unicode escape sequences.
