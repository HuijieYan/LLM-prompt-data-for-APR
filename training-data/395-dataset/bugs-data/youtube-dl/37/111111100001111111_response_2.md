The error occurs because the `decode` method is being called on a string object, which does not have a `decode` method in Python 3.

To fix the bug, we can use the `codecs` module to handle the unicode escape sequences in the string.

Here's the corrected code for the `uppercase_escape` function:

```python
import codecs

def uppercase_escape(s):
    return codecs.decode(s, 'unicode_escape')
```
