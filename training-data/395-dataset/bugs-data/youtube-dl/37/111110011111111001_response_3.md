The error occurs in the `uppercase_escape` function due to the usage of the `decode` method on a string object. This method is applicable to bytes objects, not strings. The usage of the lambda function inside `re.sub` is attempting to decode the matched string using `decode('unicode-escape')`, which is not valid for string objects.

To fix this bug:
- Remove the `decode('unicode-escape')` in the `lambda` function of the `re.sub`.
- Since the lambda function is already returning the matched string, there is no need for further decoding.

The corrected function `uppercase_escape`:

```python
import re

def uppercase_escape(s):
    return re.sub(
        r'\\U[0-9a-fA-F]{8}',
        lambda m: m.group(0), s)
```

By removing the `decode('unicode-escape')` from the lambda function, this corrected function will properly handle the input cases provided in the test function without any decoding errors.
