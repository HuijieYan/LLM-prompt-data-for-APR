The test case is trying to test the `uppercase_escape` function with two different input strings, one containing non-ASCII characters and the other containing a Unicode escape sequence.

The error message indicates that the `str` object does not have an attribute `decode`, which means that the `decode` method is being called on a string object.

The reason for the bug is that the `decode` method is being called on the result of `re.sub` which is a string, and `decode` is a method of bytes objects, not strings.

To fix the bug, we can modify the lambda function in the `re.sub` call to use `codecs.decode` to decode the Unicode escape sequence.

Here's the corrected code for the `uppercase_escape` function:

```python
import re
import codecs

def uppercase_escape(s):
    return re.sub(
        r'\\U[0-9a-fA-F]{8}',
        lambda m: codecs.decode(m.group(0), 'unicode_escape'), s)
```
