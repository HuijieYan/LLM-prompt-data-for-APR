The problem with the `uppercase_escape` function is that it is using the `decode` method on a string object, which is not valid in Python 3. The `decode` method is used to convert bytes to a string, not for converting escape sequences in strings.

To fix this issue, the `unicode_escape` codec can be used to decode the escape sequences. The `codecs` module can be used to achieve this.

Here's the corrected code for the `uppercase_escape` function:

```python
import codecs

def uppercase_escape(s):
    return codecs.decode(s, 'unicode_escape')
```

This code uses the `codecs.decode` function to decode the escape sequences in the input string using the `unicode_escape` codec, which is the correct way to handle such decoding in Python 3.
