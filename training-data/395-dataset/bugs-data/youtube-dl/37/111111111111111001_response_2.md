The error is caused because the `decode` method is being called on the string `m.group(0)` in the lambda function inside the `uppercase_escape` function. The lambda function is trying to decode Unicode escape sequences, but the `decode` method is not available for strings in Python 3.

To fix this bug, you can use the `codecs` library to decode the Unicode escape sequences.

Here's the corrected code for the `uppercase_escape` function:

```python
import codecs
import re

def uppercase_escape(s):
    return re.sub(
        r'\\U[0-9a-fA-F]{8}',
        lambda m: codecs.decode(m.group(0), 'unicode_escape'), s)
```

With this correction, the function should now work as expected and return the correct values for the provided test cases.
