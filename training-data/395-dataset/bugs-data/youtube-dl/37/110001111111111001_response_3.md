The error is caused by the use of the `decode` method on a string object in the `uppercase_escape` function. In Python, the `decode` method is used to convert a byte string to a Unicode string, but in this case, we are dealing with a regular string.

To fix this bug:
1. We need to import the `re` module, which is used in the `uppercase_escape` function but is not explicitly imported in the provided code.
2. We should use the `re.sub` method to replace the Unicode escape sequences with their corresponding characters.
3. We can remove the lambda function and directly use `re.sub` for replacement.

Here's the corrected code for the `uppercase_escape` function:

```python
import re

def uppercase_escape(s):
    return re.sub(
        r'\\U[0-9a-fA-F]{8}',
        lambda m: chr(int(m.group(0)[2:], 16)), s)
```

With this correction, the `uppercase_escape` function should work as expected and pass the provided test cases.
