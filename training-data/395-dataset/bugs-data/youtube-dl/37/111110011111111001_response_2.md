The error occurs in the `uppercase_escape` function. The `decode` method is being called on the matched string, but the `decode` method is not available for strings in Python 3, which is causing the AttributeError.

To fix the bug, we need to replace the `decode` method with the `encode` method to decode the unicode escape sequences.

Here's the corrected code for the `uppercase_escape` function:

```python
import re

def uppercase_escape(s):
    return re.sub(
        r'\\U[0-9a-fA-F]{8}',
        lambda m: chr(int(m.group(0)[2:], 16)), s)
```

In the corrected code, the `decode` method is replaced with `chr(int(m.group(0)[2:], 16))`. This change decodes the unicode escape sequences and returns the corrected string.
