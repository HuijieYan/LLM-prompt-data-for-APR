The error in the provided function is due to the use of the `decode` method, which is not applicable in this context.

The `decode` method is used to convert a string from its encoded form to Unicode. However, in this case, the intention seems to be to convert the Unicode escape sequences (e.g. "\UXXXX") to their corresponding Unicode characters.

To fix this bug, the `unicode-escape` codec should be used instead of the `decode` method. The `unicode-escape` codec is used to translate Unicode escape sequences in a string to their corresponding Unicode characters. 

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import re

def uppercase_escape(s):
    return re.sub(
        r'\\U[0-9a-fA-F]{8}',
        lambda m: bytes(m.group(0), 'utf-8').decode('unicode-escape'), s)
```
