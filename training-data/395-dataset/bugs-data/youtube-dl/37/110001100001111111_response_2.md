The issue seems to be with the use of the `decode()` method, which is causing the error "AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'decode'".

The buggy function `uppercase_escape` uses the `re.sub()` method to replace occurrences of a pattern with the result of a function. In this case, the function uses `lambda` to match the pattern and then attempts to decode the matched string using the `decode()` method, which is causing the error in Python 3 since `str` objects don't have a `decode()` method in Python 3.

To fix this bug, the `decode()` method needs to be removed and instead, we can use the `codecs` module to achieve the same result. The `codecs` module provides a way to decode a string using Unicode escape encoding.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re
import codecs

def uppercase_escape(s):
    return re.sub(
        r'\\U[0-9a-fA-F]{8}',
        lambda m: codecs.decode(m.group(0), 'unicode-escape'), s)
```
