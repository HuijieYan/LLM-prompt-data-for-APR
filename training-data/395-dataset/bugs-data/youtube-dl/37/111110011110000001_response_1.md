The error is occurring because the `decode` method is being used on a string object, which is no longer valid in Python 3.

To fix the bug, we need to use the `codecs.decode` method to decode the Unicode escape sequence. 

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re
import codecs

def uppercase_escape(s):
    return re.sub(
        r'\\U[0-9a-fA-F]{8}',
        lambda m: codecs.decode(m.group(0), 'unicode-escape'), s)
```
