The error message points to the line in the `uppercase_escape` function in the `youtube_dl/utils.py` file. The error is occurring because the `decode` method is being called on the string `m.group(0)`, which is not necessary in Python 3 as strings are already Unicode by default.

To fix the bug, the `decode` method should be removed and replaced with the `bytes` literal, which will convert the hexadecimal escape sequence into a bytes object representing the Unicode code point.

Here is the corrected code for the `uppercase_escape` function:

```python
import re

def uppercase_escape(s):
    return re.sub(
        r'\\U[0-9a-fA-F]{8}',
        lambda m: bytes([int(m.group(0)[2:], 16)]).decode('unicode-escape'), s)
```

This fix should resolves the bug and allow the function to work correctly in Python 3.
