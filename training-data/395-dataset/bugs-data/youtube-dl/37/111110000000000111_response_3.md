The error is occurring in the `uppercase_escape` function in the `lambda` expression. The `decode` method is being called on the matched string object, which is not supported in Python 3 because strings are already unicode. 

To fix this bug, you can use the `codecs` module to achieve the same result. The `re.sub` function can be replaced with a custom function that uses `codecs.decode` to decode the matched string.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re
import codecs

def uppercase_escape(s):
    return re.sub(
        r'\\U[0-9a-fA-F]{8}',
        lambda m: codecs.decode(m.group(0), 'unicode-escape'), s)
```
