The error occurs because the `decode` method is being called on a string object, which does not have this attribute. 

To fix this bug, we can simply use the `codecs.decode` method instead of the `decode` method. This will properly decode the Unicode escape sequences.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import codecs

def uppercase_escape(s):
    return re.sub(
        r'\\U[0-9a-fA-F]{8}',
        lambda m: codecs.decode(m.group(0), 'unicode_escape'), s)
```

This code replaces the `decode` method with `codecs.decode`, which will properly handle the Unicode escape sequences and fix the bug.
