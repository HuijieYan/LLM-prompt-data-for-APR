The bug in the `uppercase_escape` function is that it is trying to use the `decode` method on the result of `re.sub`. This is causing an AttributeError because the `decode` method is used on a `bytes` object, not a `str` object.

The reason for this bug is that the `re.sub` function returns a string, and the `decode` method can only be used on a bytes object, not a string object.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `uppercase_escape` function to first compile the regular expression pattern, then use the `re.sub` function to replace the matched patterns with the result of `unicode-escape` decoding.

Here's the corrected code for the `uppercase_escape` function:

```python
import re

def uppercase_escape(s):
    pattern = re.compile(r'\\U[0-9a-fA-F]{8}')
    return pattern.sub(lambda m: bytes(m.group(0), 'utf-8').decode('unicode-escape'), s)
```

With this correction, the function should now properly handle the Unicode escape sequences and return the expected results for the given test cases.
