The bug occurs in the `js_to_json` function, where the `fix_kv` function is nested inside it. The `fix_kv` function is intended to fix key-value pairs within JavaScript code to make them valid JSON. However, the current implementation is not handling single quotes (`'`) properly.

The issue arises because the `fix_kv` function only checks if the value starts with a single quote (`'`) and then replaces escape sequences. However, it doesn't handle the case where the value itself contains a single quote. This causes the escape sequences for apostrophes to be replaced, leading to incorrect output.

To fix this, we can modify the `fix_kv` function to properly handle single quotes within the value. Additionally, we need to import the `re` module, as it is used in the `fix_kv` function but not imported in the provided code.

Here's the corrected code for the `js_to_json` function:

```python
import re

def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
            return v
        if v.startswith('"'):
            return v
        if v.startswith("'"):
            v = v[1:-1]
            v = re.sub(r"\\\\|\\'|\"", lambda m: {
                '\\\\': '\\\\',
                "\\'": "'",
                '"': '\\"',
            }[m.group(0)], v)
            return '"%s"' % v

    res = re.sub(r'''(?x)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nu]))*[^"\\]*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nu]))*[^'\\]*'|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*
        ''', fix_kv, code)
    res = re.sub(r',(\s*[\]}])', lambda m: m.group(1), res)
    return res
```

With these changes, the `fix_kv` function now correctly handles single quotes within the value, and the `js_to_json` function should produce the expected output for the provided test cases.
