The error is related to the `js_to_json` function, which is not converting single quotes to double quotes in the JSON-like input string properly.

The potential error location within the `js_to_json` function is the `fix_kv` function, specifically in the section where it handles single quoted strings and replaces them with double quoted strings.

The reason for the bug is that the `fix_kv` function does not properly handle conversion of single quoted strings to double quoted strings.

To fix the bug, the `fix_kv` function should be modified to correctly handle the conversion of single quoted strings to double quoted strings.

Here's the corrected code for the `js_to_json` function:

```python
import re

def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
            return v
        if v.startswith('"'):
            return v
        if v.startswith("'"):
            v = v[1:-1]
            v = re.sub(r"\\\\|\\'|\"", lambda m: {
                '\\\\': '\\\\',
                "\\'": "'",
                '"': '\\"',
            }[m.group(0)], v)
            return '"%s"' % v

    code = re.sub(r"(?x)
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['\"nu]))*[^'\\]*'|
        \"(?:[^\"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['\"nu]))*[^\"\\]*\" # Added missing double quote
        ", fix_kv, code)  # Adjusted the pattern to also handle double quoted strings
    res = re.sub(r',(\s*[\]}])', lambda m: m.group(1), code)
    return res
```

With the corrected code, the `js_to_json` function should now properly handle the conversion of single quoted strings to double quoted strings and pass the provided test cases.
