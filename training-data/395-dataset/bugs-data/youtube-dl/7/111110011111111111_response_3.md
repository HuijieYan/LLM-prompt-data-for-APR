The issue with the `js_to_json` function is that it is not handling the single quotes properly when converting JavaScript code to JSON format.

Looking at the test case and the error message, it is evident that the function is not converting the single quotes within the string correctly.

The potential error location within the function is the `fix_kv` nested function, which is responsible for handling the conversion of individual key-value pairs.

The reason behind the bug is that the `fix_kv` function does not correctly handle single quotes within the string. It only evaluates if the value starts with a single quote and then tries to handle escape characters. However, it does not properly cover all cases where single quotes may occur within the string.

To fix the bug, the `fix_kv` function can be updated to handle single quotes within the string more thoroughly, ensuring that they are properly escaped and converted to JSON format.

Here's the corrected code for the `js_to_json` function:

```python
import re
import json

def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
            return v
        if v.startswith('"'):
            return v
        if v.startswith("'"):
            v = v[1:-1]
            v = re.sub(r'\\\\|\\\'|"', lambda m: {
                '\\\\': '\\\\',
                "\\'": "'",
                '"': '\\"',
            }[m.group(0)], v)
        return '"%s"' % v

    res = re.sub(r'''(?x)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nu]))*[^"\\]*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nu]))*[^'\\]*'|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*
        ''', fix_kv, code)
    res = re.sub(r',(\s*[\]}])', lambda m: m.group(1), res)
    return res
```

With these updated changes, the `fix_kv` function now correctly handles the conversion of single quotes within the string and ensures that they are escaped and formatted properly when converting JavaScript code to JSON format. The test cases should now pass without any assertion errors.
