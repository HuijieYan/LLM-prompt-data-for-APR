The error message indicates that the function `js_to_json` is not correctly converting single quotes to double quotes. This is evident from the comparison between the expected and actual values in the test case.

The potential error location within the `js_to_json` function is the `fix_kv` function, where it attempts to perform the conversion of single quotes to double quotes.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `fix_kv` function is not correctly handling the conversion of single quotes to double quotes.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `fix_kv` function to correctly handle the conversion of single quotes to double quotes and escape characters. We can also simplify the regular expressions used for matching the patterns.

Here's the corrected code for the `js_to_json` function:

```python
import re

def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
            return v
        if v.startswith('"'):
            return v
        if v.startswith("'"):
            v = v[1:-1]
            v = re.sub(r"\\\\|\\'|\"", lambda m: {
                '\\\\': '\\\\',
                "\\'": "'",
                '\'': '"',  # Corrected the replacement from '"' to '\' to handle the conversion correctly
            }[m.group(0)], v)
        return '"%s"' % v

    res = re.sub(r'''(?x)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nu]))*[^"\\]*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nu]))*[^'\\]*'|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*
        ''', fix_kv, code)
    res = re.sub(r',(\s*[\]}])', lambda m: m.group(1), res)
    return res
```

This correction should ensure that the conversion of single quotes to double quotes and escape characters is handled correctly, and the test case should pass without any assertion errors.
