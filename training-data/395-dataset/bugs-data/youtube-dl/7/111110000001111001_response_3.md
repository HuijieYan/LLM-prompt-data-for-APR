The issue with the buggy function seems to be related to the regular expression used to match and replace key-value pairs in JavaScript code. The function `js_to_json` is intended to convert JavaScript code to JSON format, but it is encountering issues with the string manipulation and regular expression pattern matching.

After analyzing the buggy function, it seems that the regular expressions used in the `fix_kv` function are not correctly capturing and matching the key-value pairs in the JavaScript code. Additionally, there is no import statement for the `re` module in the provided code, so it might be causing issues with using the `re` module's functions.

To address the bug, we need to update the regular expressions used to capture the key-value pairs and fix the handling of special characters and escape sequences within the JavaScript code. Furthermore, we should add an import statement for the `re` module at the beginning of the code.

Here's the corrected code for the `js_to_json` function:

```python
import re

def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
            return v
        if v.startswith('"'):
            return v
        if v.startswith("'"):
            v = v[1:-1]
            v = re.sub(r"\\\\|\\'|\"", lambda m: {
                '\\\\': '\\',
                "\\'": "'",
                '"': '"',
            }[m.group(0)], v)
        return '"%s"' % v

    res = re.sub(r'''(?x)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nu]))*[^"\\]*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nu]))*[^'\\]*'|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*
        ''', fix_kv, code)
    res = re.sub(r',(\s*[\]}])', lambda m: m.group(1), res)
    return res
```

In the corrected code, we have added `import re` at the beginning to import the regular expression module. We have also fixed the regular expression patterns to correctly capture the key-value pairs and handle special characters and escape sequences within the JavaScript code.
