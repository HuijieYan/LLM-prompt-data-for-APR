The bug is likely in the `fix_kv` function inside the `js_to_json` function. The bug seems to be related to handling single quotes and escaped characters within the input string.

The reason for the bug is that the `fix_kv` function is not correctly handling escaped characters and single quotes. It is not properly converting single quotes to double quotes as required in JSON format.

To fix the bug, the `fix_kv` function needs to be updated to correctly handle single quotes, escaped characters, and properly convert them to JSON format.

Here's the corrected code for the `js_to_json` function:

```python
import re

def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
            return v
        if v.startswith('"'):
            return v
        if v.startswith("'"):
            v = v[1:-1]
            v = re.sub(r"\\\\|\\'|\"", lambda m: {
                '\\\\': '\\\\',
                "\\'": "'",
                '"': '\\"',
            }[m.group(0)], v)
            return '"%s"' % v

    res = re.sub(r'''(?x)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nu]))*[^"\\]*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nu]))*[^'\\]*'|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*
        ''', fix_kv, code)
    res = re.sub(r',(\s*[\]}])', lambda m: m.group(1), res)
    return res
```

With this corrected code, the `js_to_json` function should now handle single quotes and escaped characters properly, and the provided test cases should pass without any assertion errors.
