The problem in the provided code is the incorrect handling of single quotes within the `js_to_json` function. The function is intended to convert JavaScript-style code to valid JSON, but it incorrectly handles single quotes when they are used to encapsulate strings.

The bug occurs because the function `fix_kv` does not handle single quotes properly. It tries to handle them, but the logic is incorrect, leading to the assertion error in the test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `fix_kv` function to correctly handle single quotes and remove unnecessary code for escaping characters.

Here's the corrected code for the `js_to_json` function:

```python
import re

def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
            return v
        if v[0] == '"' or v[0] == "'":
            return v
        return '"%s"' % v

    res = re.sub(r'''(?x)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\["nu]))*[^"\\]*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['nu]))*[^'\\]*'|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*
        ''', fix_kv, code)
    res = re.sub(r',(\s*[\]}])', lambda m: m.group(1), res)
    return res
```

This fixed code correctly handles single quotes and should pass the provided test cases without any assertion errors.
