The buggy function `js_to_json` is intended to convert JavaScript-style code to JSON format. However, the regex patterns used in the function are causing issues.

The error message from the test function indicates that the expected output does not match the actual output when converting the input string `"The CW\\'s \\'Crazy Ex-Girlfriend\\'"`. The problem seems to be related to the processing of escape characters and mismatch in the output.

The potential error location is within the `fix_kv` function, which is used to process key-value pairs in the input code.

The bug occurs primarily due to incorrect handling of escape characters and single quotes within the `fix_kv` function. The current implementation of `fix_kv` fails to correctly handle escape sequences and single quotes in the input string, leading to discrepancies in the converted output.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure proper handling of escape sequences and single quotes within the `fix_kv` function. This can be achieved by accurately processing the escape sequences and correctly transforming the single quotes.

Here's the corrected code for the `js_to_json` function:

```python
import re

def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
            return v
        if v.startswith('"'):
            return v
        if v.startswith("'"):
            v = v[1:-1]
            v = v.replace("\\\\", "\\\\")
            v = v.replace("\\'", "'")
            v = v.replace('\\"', '"')
        return '"%s"' % v

    res = re.sub(r'''(?x)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nu]))*[^"\\]*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nu]))*[^'\\]*'|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*
        ''', fix_kv, code)
    res = re.sub(r',(\s*[\]}])', lambda m: m.group(1), res)
    return res
```

With the corrected implementation, the `fix_kv` function now replaces escape sequences and single quotes accurately, ensuring proper transformation from JavaScript-style code to valid JSON format.
