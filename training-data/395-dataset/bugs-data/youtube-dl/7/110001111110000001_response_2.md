The error message indicates that the function `js_to_json` does not correctly convert the input string into a JSON format for the third test case. The actual output contains additional escape characters compared to the expected output.

The potential error in the `js_to_json` function seems to be with the handling of single quotes and escape characters. It fails to properly convert the input string into a JSON string format.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle single quotes and escape characters properly. It incorrectly adds additional escape characters to the single quotes in the input string.

To fix this bug, the function should correctly handle single quotes and escape characters. It should also ensure that the correct JSON string format is returned for both single and double quote instances in the input string.

Below is the corrected code for the `js_to_json` function:

```python
import re
import json

def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
            return v
        if v.startswith('"'):
            return v
        if v.startswith("'"):
            v = v[1:-1]
            v = re.sub(r"\\\\|\\'|\"", lambda m: {
                '\\\\': '\\\\',
                "\\'": "'",
                '"': '\\"',
            }[m.group(0)], v)
            v = re.sub(r"\\n", "\\\\n", v)
            return '"%s"' % v

    res = re.sub(r'''(?x)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nu]))*[^"\\]*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nu]))*[^'\\]*'|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*
        ''', fix_kv, code)
    res = re.sub(r',(\s*[\]}])', lambda m: m.group(1), res)
    return res
```

In the corrected code, extra escape characters such as `\\n` are handled properly, and the substitution of single quotes within the string value is fixed. This should resolve the issue and produce the expected output for the given test cases.
