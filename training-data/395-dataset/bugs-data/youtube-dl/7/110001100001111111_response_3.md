The main issue with the `js_to_json` function is that it seems to have been nested incorrectly. The `fix_kv` function is defined within the `js_to_json` function, which should not be the case. This is causing problems with the function's scope and definition.

The nested `fix_kv` function is preventing the `re.sub` calls within `js_to_json` from accessing the `fix_kv` function.

To fix this issue, the `fix_kv` function should be moved outside of the `js_to_json` function so that it is accessible to the `re.sub` calls.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re

# relative function's signature in this file
def fix_kv(m):
    v = m.group(0)
    if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
        return v
    if v.startswith('"'):
        return v
    if v.startswith("'"):
        v = v[1:-1]
        v = re.sub(r"\\\\|\\'|\"", lambda m: {
            '\\\\': '\\\\',
            "\\'": "'",
            '"': '\\"',
        }[m.group(0)], v)
    return '"%s"' % v

def js_to_json(code):
    res = re.sub(r'''(?x)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nu]))*[^"\\]*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nu]))*[^'\\]*'|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*
        ''', fix_kv, code)
    res = re.sub(r',(\s*[\]}])', lambda m: m.group(1), res)
    return res
```

By moving the `fix_kv` function definition outside of `js_to_json`, it is now accessible to the regular expressions and will fix the problematic calls.
