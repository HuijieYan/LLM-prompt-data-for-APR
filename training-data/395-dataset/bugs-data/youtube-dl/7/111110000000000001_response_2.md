Potential error location:
The issue seems to be with the regular expression used in the fix_kv function. It is not properly handling all the cases for converting JavaScript to JSON.

Reason behind the bug:
The regular expressions used in the function are not comprehensive enough to handle all cases of JavaScript code, especially when it comes to handling strings and escaping characters.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use a more comprehensive regular expression to properly handle strings and escape characters in the JavaScript code.
2. Use built-in libraries or modules to convert JavaScript to JSON, as they have already been thoroughly tested and are more likely to handle edge cases effectively.

Corrected code:
```python
import re

def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
            return v
        if v.startswith('"'):
            return v
        if v.startswith("'"):
            v = v[1:-1]
            v = re.sub(r"\\\\|\\'|\"", lambda m: {
                '\\\\': '\\\\',
                "\\'": "'",
                '"': '\\"',
            }[m.group(0)], v)
            return '"%s"' % v
        return '"%s"' % v

    res = re.sub(r'''(?x)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nu]))*[^"\\]*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nu]))*[^'\\]*'|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*
        ''', fix_kv, code)
    res = re.sub(r',(\s*[\]}])', lambda m: m.group(1), res)
    return res
```
