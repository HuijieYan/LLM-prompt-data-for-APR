The issue in the provided function `js_to_json` is that it is trying to parse and fix key-value pairs in a JavaScript-like format. However, the current implementation does not handle all cases properly, leading to incorrect output.

The function seems to be trying to parse JavaScript-like objects and convert them to JSON format, but the regular expressions used for parsing are not handling all cases properly.

To fix the bug, we can make the following improvements:
1. Update the regular expressions to properly match and capture key-value pairs in the JavaScript-like input string.
2. Use a more robust approach to handle escaping and replacing special characters in the key-value pairs.

Here's the corrected code for the `js_to_json` function:

```python
import re
import json

def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
            return v
        if v.startswith('"'):
            return v
        if v.startswith("'"):
            v = v[1:-1]
            v = re.sub(r"\\\\|\\'|\"", lambda m: {
                '\\\\': '\\\\',
                "\\'": "'",
                '"': '\\"',
            }[m.group(0)], v)
        return '"%s"' % v

    res = re.sub(r'''(?x)
        "((?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nu]))*[^"\\]*)"|
        '((?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nu]))*[^'\\]*)'|
        ([a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*)
        ''', fix_kv, code)
    res = re.sub(r',(\s*[\]}])', lambda m: m.group(1), res)
    res = res.replace("'", '"')  # Replace single quotes with double quotes
    return json.loads(res)
```

In the corrected code, we have updated the regular expressions to properly capture key-value pairs and other tokens in the input string. We have also added a final step to replace single quotes with double quotes in the output string before loading it as JSON. This should ensure that the function properly handles various cases and produces valid JSON output.
