The error occurs in the `_build_selector_function` method of the `YoutubeDL` class. The error message indicates that it is trying to access the `type` attribute of a `NoneType` object.

Given that the `selector` object is `None`, it is likely that there is an issue with setting the `selector` value, possibly within the `_parse_format_selection` method. It seems that the parsing logic doesn't properly handle some input cases, resulting in a `None` value being passed to the `_build_selector_function` method.

To fix this, I would recommend reviewing the `_parse_format_selection` method and ensuring that it returns a valid `selector` object instead of `None` in all input scenarios. This might involve adding additional checks or validating the input tokens more thoroughly to cover all possible cases.

Here's the corrected code for the `build_format_selector` method:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # Existing code as is...

    def _build_selector_function(selector):
        if isinstance(selector, list):
            fs = [_build_selector_function(s) for s in selector]

            def selector_function(formats):
                for f in fs:
                    for format in f(formats):
                        yield format
            return selector_function
        elif selector is None:  # Check for None value
            return lambda formats: []  # Return an empty list for None selector
        elif selector.type == GROUP:
            selector_function = _build_selector_function(selector.selector)
            return selector_function
        # Other conditions remain the same

    # Existing code as is...
```

By adding the check for `selector is None` and returning an empty list in that case, we handle the `None` value from the parser in a graceful manner. This should prevent the AttributeError from occurring.
