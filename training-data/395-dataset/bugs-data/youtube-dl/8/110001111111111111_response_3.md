The error in the provided function seems to be occurring at the line `elif selector.type == GROUP:`. The error message indicates that the `selector` is `None` and therefore does not have an attribute `type`.

This error is likely occurring because the `selector` is not being assigned a proper value before reaching this line, and as a result, it is `None`. 

To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the `selector` is properly assigned a value before trying to access its attribute `type`. One possible way to do this is by adding a condition to check if `selector` is `None` and then handle this case appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `build_format_selector` function:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    def _build_selector_function(selector):
        if selector is None:
            def selector_function(formats):
                return iter([])
            return selector_function

        if isinstance(selector, list):
            fs = [_build_selector_function(s) for s in selector]

            def selector_function(formats):
                for f in fs:
                    for format in f(formats):
                        yield format
            return selector_function
            
        # ... (other code remains unchanged)  
```
