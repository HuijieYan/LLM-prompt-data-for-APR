The potential error location within the problematic function is the "syntax_error" function. This function returns a SyntaxError, but it is not being used or raised anywhere within the "build_format_selector" function. This means that if there is a syntax error, it would not be handled correctly.

The reason for the bug is that the "syntax_error" function is defined inside the "build_format_selector" function, but it is not being called or raised anywhere.

To fix this bug, the "syntax_error" function should be raised when a syntax error is encountered in the "build_format_selector" function.

Here's the corrected code for the "build_format_selector" function:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    import collections
    import io
    import tokenize
    import itertools

    PICKFIRST = 'PICKFIRST'
    MERGE = 'MERGE'
    SINGLE = 'SINGLE'
    GROUP = 'GROUP'
    FormatSelector = collections.namedtuple('FormatSelector', ['type', 'selector', 'filters'])

    def syntax_error(note, start):
        message = (
            'Invalid format specification: '
            '{0}\n\t{1}\n\t{2}^'.format(note, format_spec, ' ' * start[1]))
        raise SyntaxError(message)
    
    # rest of the code...
```

In the corrected code, the "syntax_error" function has been placed at the beginning of the "build_format_selector" function and it is being raised with an appropriate message when a syntax error is encountered. This ensures that syntax errors are handled correctly within the function.
