The error message indicates that the `selector` variable is `None` and an attribute `type` is being accessed on it, leading to an `AttributeError`. This suggests that the `selector` variable is not being properly assigned a value within the function.

The bug occurs because the `selector` variable is being set to `None` in the `_parse_format_selection` function, and it is not being handled appropriately in the `_build_selector_function` function. This leads to the `AttributeError` when trying to access the `type` attribute on a `None` object.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the `selector` is `None` in the `_build_selector_function` function. This can be done by adding a check for `None` before trying to access the `type` attribute.

Below is the corrected code for the `build_format_selector` function:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged) ...

    def _build_selector_function(selector):
        if selector is None:
            def selector_function(formats):
                return iter(formats)
            return selector_function
        elif isinstance(selector, list):
            fs = [_build_selector_function(s) for s in selector]

            def selector_function(formats):
                for f in fs:
                    for format in f(formats):
                        yield format
            return selector_function
        elif selector.type == GROUP:
            selector_function = _build_selector_function(selector.selector)
            return selector_function
        # (the rest of the function remains unchanged) ...
```

With this change, we explicitly handle the case where `selector` is `None` and return a function that simply returns an iterator over the input formats.

This modification should resolve the `AttributeError` and ensure proper handling of the `selector` variable.
