The error occurs when the `_build_selector_function` function tries to access the attribute `type` of the `selector` object which is `None`. This leads to the `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'type'`.

This bug is occurring because the `selector` object is becoming `None` at some point in the code. This could be due to incorrect parsing or handling of the `format_spec` tokens.

To fix this bug, proper error handling and parsing of the `format_spec` tokens is required. Additionally, input validation and checks for edge cases should be incorporated to prevent `selector` from becoming `None`.

Here's the corrected code for the `build_format_selector` function:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # existing code remains the same

    # ... (omitted code)

    parsed_selector = _parse_format_selection(iter(TokenIterator(tokens)))

    if parsed_selector is None:
        # handle the case when parsed_selector is None
        raise ValueError("Invalid format specification")

    return _build_selector_function(parsed_selector)
```

In the `_parse_format_selection` function, proper checks and validation should be added to ensure that `parsed_selector` is properly initialized and returned. Handling edge cases and unexpected scenarios should also be considered.

By incorporating these changes, the function should be able to handle the `format_spec` correctly without leading to a `None` value for the `selector`.
