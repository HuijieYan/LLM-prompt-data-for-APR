This bug is occurring because the `selector` variable is being assigned a value of `None` when it is expected to be of type `FormatSelector`. This is causing an `AttributeError` when the code tries to access the `type` attribute of the `selector` variable.

The potential error location is in the `_parse_format_selection` function within the `build_format_selector` method. Specifically, when the `current_selector` variable is assigned a value of `None` and then used without being properly initialized.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to ensure that the `current_selector` variable is correctly initialized before it is accessed.

Here's the corrected code for the `build_format_selector` method:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
        def syntax_error(note, start):
            message = (
                'Invalid format specification: '
                '{0}\n\t{1}\n\t{2}^'.format(note, format_spec, ' ' * start[1]))
            return SyntaxError(message)

        # ... (other helper functions)

        def _parse_format_selection(tokens, inside_merge=False, inside_choice=False, inside_group=False):
            selectors = []
            current_selector = None
            for type, string, start, _, _ in tokens:
                # ENCODING is only defined in python 3.x
                if type == getattr(tokenize, 'ENCODING', None):
                    continue
                elif type in [tokenize.NAME, tokenize.NUMBER]:
                    current_selector = FormatSelector(SINGLE, string, [])
                # rest of the code remains the same
```

Please note that the complete fix may also require changes to other parts of the code, so it's important to thoroughly test the corrected function to ensure it is working as expected.
