The test case `test_youtube_format_selection` involves creating a YoutubeIE object, sorting the formats, and then processing the ie result using the process_ie_result method of the YDL class. The error occurs during the processing of the ie result, specifically in the build_format_selector method of the YDL class.

The error message indicates that the 'selector' variable is None and does not have an attribute 'type', causing an AttributeError. This suggests that there is an issue with the handling of None values in the _build_selector_function method.

The bug likely occurs because the _build_selector_function method does not handle the case when the 'selector' is None. This results in the AttributeError when trying to access the 'type' attribute of None.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check for None in the _build_selector_function method and handle it appropriately. This can be done by returning a default value or raising an exception when the selector is None.

Here's the corrected code for the build_format_selector method:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # existing code here...

    def _build_selector_function(selector):
        if selector is None:
            return lambda formats: []  # Return an empty list for None selector
        if isinstance(selector, list):
            fs = [_build_selector_function(s) for s in selector]

            def selector_function(formats):
                for f in fs:
                    for format in f(formats):
                        yield format
            return selector_function
        # remaining code...
```

In this correction, if the 'selector' is None, the _build_selector_function returns a lambda function that always returns an empty list. This ensures that the None case is handled without causing an AttributeError.
