The bug appears to be in the `build_format_selector` function. The function seems to be returning a function instead of an instance of `FormatSelector`. This could be the reason for the bug. The function is complicating the process by returning the wrong type.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the `build_format_selector` function returns an instance of `FormatSelector` rather than a function. We can do this by creating an instance of `FormatSelector` with the correct parameters and returning that instance at the end of the function.

Here's the corrected code for the `build_format_selector` function:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    PICKFIRST = 'PICKFIRST'
    MERGE = 'MERGE'
    SINGLE = 'SINGLE'
    GROUP = 'GROUP'
    
    class FormatSelector:
        def __init__(self, type, selector, filters):
            self.type = type
            self.selector = selector
            self.filters = filters

    # ... (omitted code) ...

    stream = io.BytesIO(format_spec.encode('utf-8'))
    try:
        tokens = list(compat_tokenize_tokenize(stream.readline))
    except tokenize.TokenError:
        raise syntax_error('Missing closing/opening brackets or parenthesis', (0, len(format_spec)))

    # ... (omitted code) ...

    return FormatSelector(type, selector, filters)
```

In the corrected code, the `build_format_selector` function now returns an instance of `FormatSelector` with the correct parameters, ensuring that the correct type is returned.
