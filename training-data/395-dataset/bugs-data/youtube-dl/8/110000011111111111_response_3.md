The error message indicates that the 'selector' is None when trying to access its 'type' attribute in the '_build_selector_function' function. This means that the 'selector' is not being properly initialized or is becoming None unexpectedly.

The potential error location is inside the '_parse_format_selection' function where the 'current_selector' may not be initialized properly, leading to a None value.

The potential reason for the bug is that there may be a code path where the 'current_selector' is not being set before it is used, or it is being set to None unexpectedly.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that 'current_selector' is initialized properly in all code paths.

Here is the corrected code for the 'build_format_selector' function:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # existing code...

    def _parse_format_selection(tokens, inside_merge=False, inside_choice=False, inside_group=False):
        selectors = []
        current_selector = None  # Initialize current_selector

        # existing code...

        if current_selector:
            selectors.append(current_selector)
        return selectors

    def _build_selector_function(selector):
        if isinstance(selector, list):
            fs = [_build_selector_function(s) for s in selector]

            def selector_function(formats):
                for f in fs:
                    for format in f(formats):
                        yield format
            return selector_function
        elif isinstance(selector, FormatSelector) and selector.type == GROUP:  # Check if selector is an instance of FormatSelector
            selector_function = _build_selector_function(selector.selector)
            return selector_function
        # existing code...

    # existing code...
```

In the '_parse_format_selection' function, the 'current_selector' is now initialized to None at the beginning of the function. Additionally, in the '_build_selector_function', we check if the 'selector' is an instance of FormatSelector before accessing its 'type' attribute to avoid the 'NoneType' attribute error.
