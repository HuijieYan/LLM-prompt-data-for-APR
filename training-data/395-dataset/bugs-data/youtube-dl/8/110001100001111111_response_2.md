**Error Location and Bug Analysis:**
The code provided has a function called `build_format_selector` that appears to be defining a set of nested functions within it. The issue lies with the `syntax_error` function declared within the `build_format_selector`. The `syntax_error` function is returning a `SyntaxError` instance, but it is not being handled or raised within the `build_format_selector` function.

**Reasons behind the Bug:**
The `syntax_error` function seems to be intended for creating a `SyntaxError` instance, but it is not being handled or raised within the `build_format_selector` function. This might result in unexpected behavior or unnoticed syntax errors that need to be explicitly addressed or reported.

**Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:**
To address the bug, the `SyntaxError` instance should either be raised or returned explicitly from the `build_format_selector` function. It is important to handle syntax errors properly to provide meaningful feedback to the user in case of incorrect format specifications.

**Corrected Code:**
```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    def syntax_error(note, start):
        message = (
            'Invalid format specification: '
            '{0}\n\t{1}\n\t{2}^'.format(note, format_spec, ' ' * start[1]))
        raise SyntaxError(message)
