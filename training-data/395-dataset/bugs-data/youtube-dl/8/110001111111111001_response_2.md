This error is caused because the `selector` is `None` in the `_build_selector_function` method. This is occurring because the `parser_selector` function is returning a `None` value.

To fix this bug, the `_parse_format_selection` function should be examined to ensure that it returns a valid value for `selector`.

The correct code for the `build_format_selector` method is as follows:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # ... (other code)

    def _parse_format_selection(tokens, inside_merge=False, inside_choice=False, inside_group=False):
        # ... (existing code)

        # Ensure a valid value is returned
        if not selectors:
            return []  # Return an empty list if no selectors are found

        return selectors

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```
In this corrected version, we ensure that the `_parse_format_selection` function always returns a non-None value. If it determines that no selectors are found, it returns an empty list instead of None.
