The error is occurring because the `build_format_selector` function is trying to access the `type` attribute of `selector` when `selector` is `None`. This indicates that `selector` is not being properly assigned a value.

The potential error location seems to be within the `_parse_format_selection` function where `selector` is not being explicitly defined in the component branches.

The bug occurs because the `selector` variable may not be properly defined in all code paths within the `_parse_format_selection` function, leading to it being `None` in certain conditions.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that `selector` is defined in all code paths within the `_parse_format_selection` function, especially when branching into different conditions based on the `type` of the token.

Here's the corrected code for the `build_format_selector` function:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)
    def _parse_format_selection(tokens, inside_merge=False, inside_choice=False, inside_group=False):
        selectors = []
        current_selector = None
        for type, string, start, _, _ in tokens:
            # ENCODING is only defined in python 3.x
            if type == getattr(tokenize, 'ENCODING', None):
                continue
            elif type in [tokenize.NAME, tokenize.NUMBER]:
                current_selector = FormatSelector(SINGLE, string, [])
            elif type == tokenize.OP:
                if string == ')':
                    if not inside_group:
                        # ')' will be handled by the parentheses group
                        tokens.restore_last_token()
                    break
                # ... (other conditions remain unchanged)
            elif type == tokenize.ENDMARKER:
                break

        if current_selector:
            selectors.append(current_selector)
        
        return selectors

    # ... (other code remains unchanged)
```

In this correction, we ensure that the `current_selector` is appended to the `selectors` list if it exists, regardless of the code path taken. This ensures that `selectors` will not be empty and that `None` will not be passed as `selector` in the subsequent code.
