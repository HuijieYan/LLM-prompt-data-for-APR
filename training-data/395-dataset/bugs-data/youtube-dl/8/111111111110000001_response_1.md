1. The test case `test_youtube_format_selection` is trying to test the format selection functionality of the `YoutubeDL` class with different format specifications.

2. The error occurs when the `process_ie_result` method of the `YoutubeDL` class is called, which in turn calls the `build_format_selector` method.

3. The bug occurs because the `selector` variable is None, and there is no check for this condition before trying to access its `type` attribute. It seems that the `parsed_selector` might not be constructed correctly, resulting in the `None` value for the `selector` variable.

4. One approach to fixing the bug would be to add a check for the `None` value of the `selector` variable before attempting to access its `type` attribute. Additionally, the logic to construct the `parsed_selector` from the format specification should be reviewed to ensure that it properly constructs the selector data structure.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `build_format_selector` method:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # ... (other code remains the same)

    # Parsing logic to construct the parsed_selector from format_spec

    parsed_selector = _parse_format_selection(iter(TokenIterator(tokens)))
    
    if parsed_selector:
        return _build_selector_function(parsed_selector)
    else:
        raise ValueError('Failed to parse format_spec')

```

With this change, we ensure that there's a check for the parsed_selector before building the selector function, and we raise a `ValueError` if the parsing fails to construct a valid selector. This will prevent the NoneType attribute error and provide more robust error handling for malformed format specifications.
