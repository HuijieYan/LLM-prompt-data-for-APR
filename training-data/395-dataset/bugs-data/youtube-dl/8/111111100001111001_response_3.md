The error in the `build_format_selector` function is likely due to the missing import statement for the `collections` module, which is used for the `collections.namedtuple` function. 

To fix this issue, we need to add the import statement at the beginning of the file:
```python
import collections
```

Additionally, it seems that there are other function calls and variable accesses related to the format_spec and self object which may not be accurately referential or well located. Please analyze and refactor the lines accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `build_format_selector` function:

```python
# import collections module
import collections
import io
import tokenize
import itertools

# ... (other function and class definitions)

def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    def syntax_error(note, start):
        message = (
            'Invalid format specification: '
            '{0}\n\t{1}\n\t{2}^'.format(note, format_spec, ' ' * start[1]))
        return SyntaxError(message)

    PICKFIRST = 'PICKFIRST'
    MERGE = 'MERGE'
    SINGLE = 'SINGLE'
    GROUP = 'GROUP'
    FormatSelector = collections.namedtuple('FormatSelector', ['type', 'selector', 'filters'])

    # rest of the function implementation remains unchanged
```

It's important to thoroughly test the new implementation with various input values and evaluate its behavior to ensure that the bug has been resolved. Additionally, review the local variable references within the `build_format_selector` method to ensure that they are utilized correctly.
