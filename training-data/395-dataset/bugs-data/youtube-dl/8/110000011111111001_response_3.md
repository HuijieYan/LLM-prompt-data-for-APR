Based on the error message, it seems that the issue is related to the `selector` being `None` in the `_build_selector_function` of the YoutubeDL class, which then causes an AttributeError when trying to access the `type` attribute.

The `selector` variable is expected to be a FormatSelector object, but it's None when it gets to the `elif selector.type == GROUP` line, leading to the AttributeError.

The reason behind this error might be due to incorrect parsing or handling of the `format_spec` input when building the `parsed_selector` within the `build_format_selector` function.

One approach to fix this bug is to ensure that the parsing and processing of the `format_spec` input result in a valid `parsed_selector` object, avoiding any situation where `selector` might be None.

Here's the corrected code for the `build_format_selector` function:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # Existing code...

    def _build_selector_function(selector):
        if isinstance(selector, list):
            fs = [_build_selector_function(s) for s in selector]

            def selector_function(formats):
                for f in fs:
                    for fmt in f(formats):  # Renamed 'format' to 'fmt' to avoid conflict with Python's built-in 'format' function
                        yield fmt
            return selector_function
        elif selector and selector.type == GROUP:  # Added check for None before accessing type attribute
            selector_function = _build_selector_function(selector.selector)
            return selector_function
        # Other if conditions and handling remain as-is...
            
    # Existing code...

    parsed_selector = _parse_format_selection(iter(TokenIterator(tokens)))
    return _build_selector_function(parsed_selector)
```

In this corrected code, we added a check for `selector` to ensure it's not None before accessing the `type` attribute. This should prevent the AttributeError and ensure proper handling of the FormatSelector objects.
