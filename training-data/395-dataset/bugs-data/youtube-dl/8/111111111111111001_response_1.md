The test case is calling the `process_ie_result` method, which in turn uses the `build_format_selector` method. The error occurs at the `elif selector.type == GROUP` line inside the `_build_selector_function` method.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `selector` is `None` when trying to access the `type` attribute. This means the expected structure of the `selector` object is not being correctly handled.

To fix this bug, the `None` case should be handled before trying to access the `type` attribute of the `selector` object. This can be done by checking if `selector` is `None` before trying to access its attributes.

Here's the corrected code for the `build_format_selector` method:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged) ...

    def _build_selector_function(selector):
        if selector is None:
            return None  # Handle the case where the selector is None
        if isinstance(selector, list):
            fs = [_build_selector_function(s) for s in selector]

            def selector_function(formats):
                for f in fs:
                    for format in f(formats):
                        yield format
            return selector_function
        elif selector.type == GROUP:  # No longer accessed if selector is None
            selector_function = _build_selector_function(selector.selector)
            # rest of the function remains unchanged
            # ...
    
    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

With this fix, the `selector` object is checked for `None` before trying to access its attributes, preventing the `NoneType` attribute error.
