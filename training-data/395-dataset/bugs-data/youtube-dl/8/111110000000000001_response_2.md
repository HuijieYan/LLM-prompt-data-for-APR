The error in the `build_format_selector` function is caused by missing import statements for the collections, io, compat_tokenize_tokenize, and itertools modules. This is resulting in NameErrors as these modules are being used without being imported.

To fix the bug, the missing import statements for the required modules should be added at the top of the source code.

Here's the corrected code for the `build_format_selector` function with the necessary import statements added:

```python
import collections
import io
import itertools
import tokenize
from .compat import compat_tokenize

# this is the corrected function
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    def syntax_error(note, start):
        message = (
            'Invalid format specification: '
            '{0}\n\t{1}\n\t{2}^'.format(note, format_spec, ' ' * start[1]))
        return SyntaxError(message)

    PICKFIRST = 'PICKFIRST'
    MERGE = 'MERGE'
    SINGLE = 'SINGLE'
    GROUP = 'GROUP'
    FormatSelector = collections.namedtuple('FormatSelector', ['type', 'selector', 'filters'])

    # ... rest of the function remains unchanged ...
```

By adding the necessary import statements, the function should now work without any NameErrors related to the missing modules.
