Based on the error message, it seems that the error occurs when checking the `selector` for its `type` attribute within the `_build_selector_function` function. The error indicates that `selector` is `None` and therefore does not have an attribute `type`.

The potential cause of the bug is likely related to the parsing and processing of the `selector` variable, which leads to it being assigned a `None` value.

To fix the bug, the parsing and processing logic for the `selector` variable should be reviewed and corrected to ensure that it receives the expected values instead of `None`.

Here's the corrected code for the `build_format_selector` function:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # ... (other code)

    def _build_selector_function(selector):
        if isinstance(selector, list):
            fs = [_build_selector_function(s) for s in selector]

            def selector_function(formats):
                for f in fs:
                    for format in f(formats):
                        yield format
            return selector_function
        elif hasattr(selector, 'type') and selector.type == 'GROUP':  # Check if selector has 'type' attribute
            selector_function = _build_selector_function(selector.selector)
        # (Rest of the code as per original function)

    # ... (remaining code)

    return _build_selector_function(parsed_selector)  # Call _build_selector_function with parsed_selector
```

In this correction, we explicitly check if the `selector` has a `type` attribute and consider the scenario when `selector` is `None`. This ensures that the function handles the `selector` properly and does not encounter the attribute error.
