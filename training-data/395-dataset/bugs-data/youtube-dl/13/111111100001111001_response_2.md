The potential error in the provided function is the incorrect handling of the `path` and `base` parameters based on their types and the presence of the `http(s)://` prefix in the `path`.

The function is designed to join a base URL with a relative path, but it improperly handles different data types and the presence of the `http(s)://` prefix. 

To fix this bug, we need to correctly handle the different data types and check for the presence of the prefix in the `path` parameter. 

Here's the corrected code for the `urljoin` function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/youtube-dl_13/youtube_dl/utils.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def urljoin(base, path):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# corrected function
def urljoin(base, path):
    import re
    from .compat import compat_str, compat_urlparse

    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
        
    if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
        return None

    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path

    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')

    if not isinstance(base, compat_str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None

    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```

In the corrected code, we ensure that the `path` is decoded as UTF-8 if it's a bytes object, and we handle different data types for `base`. We also check whether the `http(s)://` prefix is present in the `path` parameter.
