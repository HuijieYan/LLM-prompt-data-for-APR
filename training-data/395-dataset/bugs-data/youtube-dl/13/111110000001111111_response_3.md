The function `urljoin` seems to be designed to join a base URL with a relative path to create a new URL. However, it appears to have issues when dealing with different types of inputs (strings and bytes) and incorrect handling of the base URL.

The potential error location in the code is the handling of different types of inputs for `path` and `base`, as well as the incorrect condition checks.

The reasons behind the bug are:
1. The function does not handle different types of inputs for `path` and `base` properly, leading to type-related errors.
2. The conditions for checking if the `base` URL is valid are incorrect and don't handle cases where the `base` URL is missing, leading to potential errors.

To fix the bug, the following approaches can be considered:
1. Implement proper type checks for `path` and `base` to handle both strings and bytes.
2. Review the condition checks for the `path` and `base` inputs and update them to handle missing or invalid base URLs.
3. Utilize the `urlparse` module to correctly parse and join URLs.

Here's the corrected code for the `urljoin` function:

```python
import re
import urllib.parse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return urllib.parse.urljoin(base, path)
```
