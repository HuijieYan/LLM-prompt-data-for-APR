Potential error location: 

The potential error location is in the if statement where the function checks if the 'path' variable is of type 'compat_str'. This type is not defined in the given code, so it will result in an error. Additionally, the code also references 're' without importing the 're' module.

Reasons for the bug: 

The bug occurs because the function is trying to check if the 'path' and 'base' variables are of type 'compat_str' without actually defining what 'compat_str' is. Additionally, the 're' module is not imported, so the regular expression match will also result in an error.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: 

1. Import the 're' module to use regular expressions.
2. Use the 'isinstance' function to check if the 'path' and 'base' variables are strings instead of using an undefined 'compat_str' type.
3. Convert the 'base' and 'path' variables to string if they are of type 'bytes' before processing.
4. Add error handling if the 'base' or 'path' variables are None.

Corrected code:

```python
import re
from urllib.parse import urljoin as urlparse_urljoin

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return urlparse_urljoin(base, path)
```
