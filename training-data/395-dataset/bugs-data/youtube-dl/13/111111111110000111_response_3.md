The error occurred in the `urljoin` function because it returned `None` instead of the expected result of 'rtmp://foo.de' when provided with `None` and 'rtmp://foo.de' as input.

The bug occurred because the function did not handle the case where the `base` parameter is `None`. This caused the function to return `None` instead of performing the intended URL joining operation.

To fix the bug, we need to include a condition to handle the case where the `base` parameter is `None` and return the `path` parameter as the result in that case.

Here's the corrected code for the `urljoin` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin as urllib_urljoin

def urljoin(base, path):
    if base is None:
        return path
    
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, str) or not re.match(
            r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return urllib_urljoin(base, path)
```
