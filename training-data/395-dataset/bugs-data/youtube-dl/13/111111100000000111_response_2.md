Potential error location: 
The potential error is in the line `if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:`, where `compat_str` is not defined.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The `compat_str` type is not imported or defined within the function, so it's causing an error.
2. Additionally, the `re` module is not imported and used without being defined.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Import the necessary modules for `compat_str` and `re`.
2. Define `compat_str` before using it in the function.
3. Use the correct logic for checking the type and value of `path` and `base`.

Corrected code:
```python
import re
from .compat import compat_str, urlparse as compat_urlparse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, str) or not re.match(
            r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```
