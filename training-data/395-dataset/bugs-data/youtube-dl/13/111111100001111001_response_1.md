The potential error in the code is the check for whether the input `path` starts with 'http:' or 'https:'. The implementation is currently incomplete and does not handle all the scenarios specified in the input descriptions. In particular, the function should also handle the cases where the `path` input starts with '//', indicating a protocol-relative URL, and the cases where the `path` is an absolute URL.

To fix the bug, we can update the function to handle all these cases. We can use the `urllib.parse.urljoin` method to correctly join the base URL with the path.

Here's the corrected code for the `urljoin` function:

```python
import re
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return urljoin(base, path)
```

With this updated code, the `urljoin` function will handle all the specified scenarios and correctly join the base and path URLs.
