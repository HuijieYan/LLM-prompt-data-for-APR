The error message occurs because when the first argument to `urljoin` is `None`, the function should simply return the second argument, but it is currently returning `None` instead.

The buggy function does not correctly handle the case when `base` is `None`. This leads to the function returning `None` instead of the second argument when `base` is `None`. This causes the assertion error in the test case which expects the function to return the second argument when `base` is `None`.

To fix the bug, we can simply add a condition at the beginning of the function to handle the case when `base` is `None` and return `path` in this case.

Here's the corrected code for the `urljoin` function:

```python
def urljoin(base, path):
    if base is None:
        return path
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, compat_str) or not re.match(
        r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```
