The error message indicates that the function `urljoin` is not returning the expected result for the input `urljoin(None, 'rtmp://foo.de')`. The function should return `'rtmp://foo.de'`, but it is returning `None`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement `if not isinstance(base, compat_str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):`. This condition is returning `None` if `base` is `None`, which is the case for the input mentioned in the error message.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not handling the case where `base` is `None`. This causes the function to return `None` inappropriately.

To fix the bug, the conditional statement checking the validity of `base` can be replaced with a check for the existence of `base` and its string representation.

Here's the corrected code for the `urljoin` function:

```python
def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if base is not None and isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if base is not None and (isinstance(base, compat_str) and re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base)):
        return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
    return None
```
