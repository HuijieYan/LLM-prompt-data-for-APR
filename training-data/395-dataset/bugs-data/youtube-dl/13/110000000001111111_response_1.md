The buggy function `urljoin` is meant to join a base URL with a relative path to create an absolute URL. The error occurs within the function because of the use of the `compat_str` type, which is not a standard Python type. In addition, the function uses the `re` module without properly importing it.

To fix the bug, we need to replace the `compat_str` type with the standard Python type `str`, and import the `re` module at the beginning of the function. 

Here's the corrected code for the `urljoin` function:

```python
import re
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, str) or not re.match(
            r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return urljoin(base, path)
```

With these changes, the function should work correctly for all the test cases provided.
