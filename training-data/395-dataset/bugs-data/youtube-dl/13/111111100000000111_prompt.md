Please fix the function/method provided below and provide the corrected function/method as the output.


# Buggy function source code
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/youtube-dl_13/youtube_dl/utils.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def urljoin(base, path):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass



    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def urljoin(base, path):
        if isinstance(path, bytes):
            path = path.decode('utf-8')
        if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
