Error location: The bug is located in the urljoin function, particularly in the condition that checks if the 'path' parameter is a byte object and then decodes it to a string using 'utf-8'. This step is causing the issue when 'path' is set to None, resulting in incorrect behavior and the AssertionError in the test case.

Reason behind the bug: The bug occurs because the original implementation of the urljoin function does not handle the case where the 'path' parameter is None correctly. Instead of gracefully handling None inputs, the function tries to decode None as a byte object, leading to the error.

Approaches for fixing the bug: One way to fix this bug is to add a check for the 'path' parameter being None before attempting any type conversion, and return None if 'path' is None. This will provide a consistent behavior with the input value.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from youtube_dl.compat import compat_str
import re
from youtube_dl.compat import compat_urlparse


def urljoin(base, path):
    if path is None:
        return None
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, compat_str) or not re.match(
            r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```

The corrected function includes a check for 'None' values and returns 'None' if 'path' is None, preventing the occurrence of the previous bug.
