The error occurs in the last test case where the input to the `urljoin` function is `None` as the base URL. The expected output for this test case is 'rtmp://foo.de', but the actual output is `None`. This discrepancy causes the test to fail with an AssertionError.

The bug in the code is that the function does not handle the case when the base URL is `None` properly. Instead of returning `None` when the base URL is `None`, it should just return the input path as the output. 

The following is the corrected code for the `urljoin` function:

```python
def urljoin(base, path):
    if base is None:
        return path
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, compat_str) or not re.match(
            r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```

By adding the check for `None` as the base URL and returning the path in that case, the bug is fixed and the function should work as expected for all cases.
