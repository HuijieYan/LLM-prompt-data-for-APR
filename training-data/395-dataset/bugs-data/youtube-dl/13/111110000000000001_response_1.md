Potential error location: The error likely occurs in the if statement checking if the path is an instance of `compat_str` and is not empty. However, `compat_str` is not defined and should be replaced with the appropriate data type for string comparison.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug occurs because `compat_str` is not a defined data type. It seems like the intention was to check if the `path` is a string and is not empty, but the `compat_str` variable is not defined.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Replace the `compat_str` with the appropriate data type for string comparison, such as `str`.
2. Use the `re` library to check if the `path` is a valid URL instead of checking for `compat_str` type.

Corrected code:
```python
import re
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urljoin

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, str) or not re.match(
            r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return urljoin(base, path)
```
