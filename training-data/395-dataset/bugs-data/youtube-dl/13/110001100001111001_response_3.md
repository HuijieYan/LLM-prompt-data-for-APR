The problem with the provided function arises from the 'compat_str' and 'compat_urlparse' classes. These classes are likely defined somewhere else and are not available in the provided code, resulting in an error.

To fix this bug, we can use Python's built-in string manipulation functions and the urllib library instead.

Here is the corrected code for the `urljoin` function:

```python
import urllib.parse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return urllib.parse.urljoin(base, path)
```
