Potential error location: 
The code is checking for the type 'compat_str', which is not defined in the function. It seems like 'compat_str' should be a string type, but it is not defined properly in the code.

Reasons behind the bug:
The 'compat_str' type is not defined, so the function is unable to properly check the type of the variable 'path' and 'base'.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define 'compat_str' properly as a string type.
2. Use the 'str' type instead of 'compat_str' for checking the type of the variables.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re
from urllib.parse import urljoin as urlparse_urljoin

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, str) or not re.match(
            r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return urlparse_urljoin(base, path)
```
