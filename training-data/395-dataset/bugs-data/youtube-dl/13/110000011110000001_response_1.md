The test case checks the functionality of the `urljoin` function by passing different combinations of `base` and `path` parameters. It is expected to return the joined URL, taking into consideration the cases where the parameters are of type `str` or `bytes`.

The error message occurs when the test case calls `urljoin(None, 'rtmp://foo.de')` and expects it to return 'rtmp://foo.de', but it actually returns `None`. This indicates that the `urljoin` function is not handling the `None` input correctly.

The potential error location within the `urljoin` function is at the beginning of the function, where it checks if the `path` parameter is of type `bytes` and then tries to decode it to `utf-8`, but it does not handle the case where `path` is `None`.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to add a check at the beginning of the `urljoin` function to handle the case where the `path` parameter is `None`, and return `None` in that case.

Here is the corrected code for the `urljoin` function:

```python
import re
import urllib.parse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if path is None:
        return None
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, str) or not re.match(
            r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return urllib.parse.urljoin(base, path)
```

In the corrected code:
- An additional check for `path` being `None` has been added at the beginning of the function.
- The `compat_str` and `compat_urlparse` references have been replaced with native Python libraries for compatibility and parsing URLs.
