The potential error in the provided function lies in the handling of the `base` and `path` parameters, particularly when they are of type `bytes`. The function attempts to decode the `path` and `base` parameters from bytes to UTF-8 strings without first checking if they are of type `bytes`. Additionally, there are references to `compat_str` and `compat_urlparse`, which are not defined within the given code snippet.

The error occurs because the function assumes that the `path` and `base` parameters will always be of type `str`, leading to type errors when they are of type `bytes`.

To fix the bug, the function should check the type of the `path` and `base` parameters before attempting to decode them from bytes to strings. The function should also import the necessary libraries and modules such as `re` and `urllib.parse` to handle URL parsing and manipulation.

Here's the corrected code for the `urljoin` function:

```python
import re
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return urljoin(base, path)
```

With these changes, the function will correctly handle `base` and `path` parameters of both types `str` and `bytes`, and it will use the `urljoin` method from the `urllib.parse` module for joining the URLs.
