The test function `test_urljoin` is checking the output of the `urljoin` function with different inputs. Based on the error message, the specific assertion that is failing is `self.assertEqual(urljoin(None, 'rtmp://foo.de'), 'rtmp://foo.de')`, which is returning `None` instead of `'rtmp://foo.de'`.

The potential error in the `urljoin` function is that it does not handle the case where the `base` provided is `None`. This causes the `re.match` statement to raise an error when trying to access the protocol of `None`.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the possible case where the `base` provided is `None`. As a result, the function does not return the correct output when `base` is `None`.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to check for the `None` case at the beginning of the function and return `path` directly if `base` is `None`. This avoids the need to perform other checks when `base` is `None`.

Here's the corrected code for the `urljoin` function:

```python
import re
from compat import compat_str
from compat import compat_urlparse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if base is None:
        return path
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, compat_str) or not re.match(
            r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```
