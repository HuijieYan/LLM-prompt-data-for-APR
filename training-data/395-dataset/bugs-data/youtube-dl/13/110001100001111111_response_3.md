Potential error location: The bug occurs at the start of the `urljoin` function, where it attempts to handle different data types for the `path` and `base` parameters.

Reasons behind the bug: The function tries to handle both `str` and `bytes` types for the `path` and `base` parameters, but it does so inconsistently, leading to potential issues with type checking and encoding/decoding.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use consistent type checking for the `path` and `base` parameters, ensuring that they are both either `str` or `bytes`.
2. Properly handle the encoding/decoding of `bytes` data to `str` when necessary.
3. Use `six` or `future` libraries to ensure compatibility with both Python 2 and 3.

Here's the corrected code for the `urljoin` function:
```python
def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, compat_str) or not re.match(
            r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```
This code ensures consistent type checking for both `path` and `base` parameters and handles the encoding/decoding of `bytes` data to `str` when necessary.
