The bug occurs in the function 'urljoin' due to incorrect handling of the 'path' and 'base' parameters based on their types and contents. In some cases, there's a mix of bytes and strings, and the function does not handle them consistently.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to handle the different types and contents of the 'path' and 'base' parameters correctly based on their respective types.

Here's the corrected code for the 'urljoin' function:

```python
import re
from youtube_dl.compat import compat_str
from youtube_dl.compat import urljoin as compat_urljoin

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, compat_str) or not re.match(
            r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urljoin(base, path)
```
