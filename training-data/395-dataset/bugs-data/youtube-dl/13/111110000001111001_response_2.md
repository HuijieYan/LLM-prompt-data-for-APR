The main issue in the provided function is that it is using the variable `compat_str` and `compat_urlparse` without importing them. Additionally, the function is not handling the case when `path` is of type bytes and `base` is of type string. It incorrectly assumes that the type of `base` is always the same as the type of `path`.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `path` is of type bytes and `base` is of type string, as well as import the necessary modules (`compat_str` and `compat_urlparse`).

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re
from six import string_types
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, string_types) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, string_types) or not re.match(
            r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return urljoin(base, path)
```

By using `string_types` from the `six` module, we can handle both string and bytes type. Additionally, we are now directly using `urljoin` from the `urllib.parse` module to handle the URL joining, instead of using `compat_urlparse`.
