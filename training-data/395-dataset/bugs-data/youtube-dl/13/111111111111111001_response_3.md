The error seems to occur when the input `base` is None. In this case, the function should return the `path` as it is, but it returns None instead. This causes the assertion error in the test case `self.assertEqual(urljoin(None, 'rtmp://foo.de'), 'rtmp://foo.de')`.

The reason for the bug is that the function does not handle the case when the base is None. It should immediately return the `path` in these scenarios.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check for the `base` variable being None and return the `path` in that case. Additionally, the function should also handle cases where `base` is an empty string or a list.

Here's the corrected code for the `urljoin` function:

```python
def urljoin(base, path):
    if base is None:
        return path
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, compat_str) or not re.match(
            r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```
