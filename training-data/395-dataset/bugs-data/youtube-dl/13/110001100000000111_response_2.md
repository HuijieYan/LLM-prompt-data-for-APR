Potential error location: 
The bug is likely in the condition `if not isinstance(base, compat_str)` and `if not isinstance(path, compat_str)`. It seems like `compat_str` is not defined, possibly leading to this condition always being True.

Reasons behind the bug:
The `compat_str` type is not defined anywhere in the code, so the condition `if not isinstance(base, compat_str)` will always be True. This will cause the function to always return `None`.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
Define `compat_str` as a string type or use `str` instead of `compat_str`. Also, ensure that the condition `if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:` is checking for the correct conditions.

Corrected code:
```python
import re
from .compat import compat_urlparse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, str) or not re.match(
            r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```
