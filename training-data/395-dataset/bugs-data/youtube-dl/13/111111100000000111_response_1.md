Potential error location: The function seems to have indentation issues and also has a mix of Python 2 and Python 3 compatibility checks.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. Incorrect indentation of the function
2. Incorrect usage of `compat_str` and `compat_urlparse` which are not defined in the given code.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Fix the indentation of the function.
2. Use compatible string handling for both Python 2 and 3.
3. Use Python's built-in urllib.parse module for URL parsing and joining.

Corrected code:
```python
import re
from urllib.parse import urljoin as urllib_urljoin

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, str) or not re.match(
            r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return urllib_urljoin(base, path)
```
