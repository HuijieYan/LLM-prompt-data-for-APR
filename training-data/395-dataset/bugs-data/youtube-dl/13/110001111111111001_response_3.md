Based on the error message, it seems that the function is not handling the case where the `base` parameter is `None` properly. This results in an unexpected return value of `None` instead of the expected value for the given inputs.

The bug occurs because the function does not have a check to handle the case where the `base` parameter is `None`. When `base` is `None`, the function should return `path` instead of trying to perform any URL join operation. Additionally, the function may have issues with handling different data types for the `path` and `base` parameters.

To fix the bug, the function should include a check for `None` as the `base` parameter and handle it appropriately. Additionally, it should ensure that the data types of the `path` and `base` parameters are properly handled.

Here's the corrected code for the `urljoin` function:

```python
import re
from youtube_dl.compat import compat_str
from youtube_dl.utils import compat_urlparse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if path is None:
        return None
    
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')

    if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
        return None

    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path

    if base is None:
        return path

    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')

    if not isinstance(base, compat_str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None

    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```

In this corrected code, an additional check for `None` has been included to handle the case when the `base` parameter is `None`. If `base` is `None`, the function returns `path` directly. This ensures that the function no longer encounters an error when `base` is `None`.
