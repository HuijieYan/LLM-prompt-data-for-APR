Potential Error Location:
The potential error is in the condition `if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:`, which is checking if the path is not of type `compat_str` or if it is empty, then it returns `None`. However, `compat_str` is not defined in the function, and the logic seems to be incorrect.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function is checking for a type `compat_str` which is not defined within the function, leading to a NameError. Additionally, the condition for checking if the path is empty is not applied correctly.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
1. Remove the check for `compat_str` and instead, check if the path is a non-empty string.
2. Use the `re.match` function with the correct regular expression pattern for checking the URL format.
3. Ensure that the input arguments `base` and `path` are properly handled and decoded if they are of type `bytes`.

Corrected Code:
```python
import re
import urllib.parse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return urllib.parse.urljoin(base, path)
```
