The error is occurring because the function is not handling the case where `base` is `None` correctly. This is resulting in a wrong URL being returned when `base` is `None`.

The bug occurs because the function does not account for the case where `base` is `None`. As a result, when `base` is `None`, the function returns the path as the result, instead of handling it as a special case.

To fix this bug, the function needs to add a condition to check if `base` is `None` and return `None` in that case. This will ensure that the function handles the case where base is `None` correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import re
from six import text_type

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, text_type) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if base is None:  # added condition to handle base being None
        return None
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, text_type) or not re.match(
            r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```
