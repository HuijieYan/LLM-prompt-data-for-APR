The error seems to be occurring when the input `None` is passed into the `urljoin` function. The function should handle this case properly, but it is returning `None` instead of the expected result 'rtmp://foo.de'.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the part where it handles the case when `base` is None. The function is not properly returning the value of `path` when `base` is None.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not handling the case of `base` being None properly. It should return `path` when `base` is None.

One approach to fixing the bug is to check if `base` is None at the beginning of the function and return `path` if it is. This will prevent further processing and return the expected result.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def urljoin(base, path):
    if base is None:
        return path
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, compat_str) or not re.match(
            r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```
