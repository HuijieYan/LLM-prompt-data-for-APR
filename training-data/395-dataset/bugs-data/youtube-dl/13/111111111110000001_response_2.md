Potential error location within the problematic function:
The error seems to occur when the value of 'base' is None. This is because the code does not handle the case where the 'base' argument is None.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The function does not handle the case where the 'base' argument is None. When 'base' is None, the function should directly return the 'path' argument.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
The 'base' argument needs to be checked for None, and if it is None, the function should return the 'path' argument directly. This will ensure that the function does not attempt to perform any URL joining when the 'base' is None.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import re
from youtube_dl.compat import compat_str
import youtube_dl.compat_urlparse as compat_urlparse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if base is None:
        return path
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, compat_str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```
