The error occurs because the function `urljoin` incorrectly returns `None` for certain input cases. This is due to incorrect type checking where the function expects the base URL to be of type `compat_str` and it fails to handle `None` values properly. 

To fix the bug, the type checking should be adjusted to properly handle `None` values and ensure that the base URL is converted to `str` type if it is not already a string.

Here is the corrected code for the `urljoin` function:

```python
import re
from .compat import urlparse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if base is None:
        base = ''
        
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, str) or not re.match(
            r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```

This corrected code handles the `None` case and type conversion in a better way, ensuring that the function behaves correctly for all input cases.
