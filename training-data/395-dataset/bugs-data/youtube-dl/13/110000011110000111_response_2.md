The error message from the test function is raised due to the incorrect behavior of the urljoin function when handling a base URL of None. The function should return the path URL itself when the base URL is None, but it is returning None instead, causing the AssertionError.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the last return statement before the end of the function:
```python
if not isinstance(base, compat_str) or not re.match(
        r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
    return None
```
This statement is responsible for returning None when the base URL is None.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the condition to check if the base URL is None is missing, and instead, it only checks the compatibility of the base URL and its format.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be modified to account for the case when the base URL is None.

Here's the corrected code for the urljoin function:

```python
import re

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if base is None:  # handle the case when the base URL is None
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, compat_str) or not re.match(
            r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```

With this correction, the urljoin function should now handle the case when the base URL is None and return the correct result, resolving the AssertionError in the test case.
