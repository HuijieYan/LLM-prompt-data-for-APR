The error in the given function is due to the inconsistent handling of string and byte inputs. The function checks if the path is an instance of `bytes` and then decodes it, but it doesn't handle the base URL in the same way. This results in issues when combining the base URL and the path.

To fix this, the function should consistently handle both path and base URL as strings, regardless of their original type.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re
from youtube_dl.compat import compat_str, compat_urlparse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, compat_str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```

With this corrected function, the inconsistencies in handling str and bytes inputs have been resolved, and the function should now handle all the input cases correctly.
