The error message suggests that the function `urljoin` is not returning the expected value for the input parameters `(None, 'rtmp://foo.de')`. This indicates that the function is not handling this specific scenario correctly.

The bug in the given code is that it is not checking for the validity of the base URL properly. When the base URL is None, the `compat_urlparse.urljoin` method does not handle it correctly, resulting in the unexpected behavior observed in the test case.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to include a check for the base URL being None and return the path as-is in that case.

Here is the corrected code for the `urljoin` function:

```python
import re
from youtube_dl.compat import compat_str
from youtube_dl.utils import compat_urlparse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if base is None:
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, compat_str) or not re.match(
            r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```

With this corrected code, the `urljoin` function should correctly handle all the test cases provided and not raise any assertion errors.
