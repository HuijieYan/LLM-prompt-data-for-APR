The error message indicates that the function is not handling the case where the `base` parameter is `None` correctly. Instead of returning `None`, it is trying to join the `path` with `None` and returning a string, leading to the assertion error.

The source of this bug lies in the function not checking for the `None` value of the `base` parameter at the beginning of the function.

The reason for this bug is that the function assumes `base` is always a string, without checking for `None`. When `None` is passed as the `base` parameter, the function should immediately return `None` without further processing.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check for `None` at the beginning of the function. Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import re
import six
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urljoin as compat_urlparse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if base is None:
        return None
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, six.text_type) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, six.text_type) or not re.match(
            r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```

This corrected code includes a check for `None` in the `base` parameter at the beginning of the function. If `base` is `None`, the function immediately returns `None` without further processing, which should fix the bug.
