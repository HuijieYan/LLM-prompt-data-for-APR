Potential error location: 
The bug seems to be occurring in the line `if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:`, where it checks if `path` is not an instance of `compat_str` or if it is empty. The variable `compat_str` is not defined in the function, which is likely causing the bug.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The code is using `compat_str` without defining it, causing the condition to always evaluate to `None`. This prevents the function from executing the intended logic.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define `compat_str` within the function or import it from an external module if it's available.
2. Check the type of `path` using Python's built-in types such as `str` or `bytes` directly rather than relying on `compat_str`.

Corrected code:

```python
import re
from youtube_dl.utils import compat_str, compat_urlparse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, str) or not re.match(
            r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```
