The error message is indicating that when `urljoin` receives `None` as the `base` argument and 'rtmp://foo.de' as the `path` argument, it returns `None` instead of the expected 'rtmp://foo.de'.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the following lines:

```python
if not isinstance(base, compat_str) or not re.match(
        r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
    return None
```

This is causing `None` to be returned when the `base` is `None`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is returning `None` when the `base` is `None`, without checking if the `path` starts with a valid URL scheme.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the `path` starts with a valid URL scheme. If it does, we should return the `path`. If it does not, we should then check if the `base` is not `None`. If the `base` is not `None`, then we should proceed with joining the `path` with the `base` using `compat_urlparse.urljoin`.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re
from six import string_types
import six.moves.urllib.parse as compat_urlparse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if base is not None and isinstance(base, string_types) and re.match(
            r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        if isinstance(base, bytes):
            base = base.decode('utf-8')
        return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
    return None
```
