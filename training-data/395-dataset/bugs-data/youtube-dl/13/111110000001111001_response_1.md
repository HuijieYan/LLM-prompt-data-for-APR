Based on the provided buggy function and test cases, it seems that the bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of string and bytes types for the 'path' and 'base' parameters. The function attempts to decode 'path' and 'base' from bytes to string without considering their original type. 

To fix the bug, we need to handle cases where 'path' and 'base' are of type bytes separately and perform the necessary decoding before processing them in the function.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import re
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, str) or not re.match(
            r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return urljoin(base, path)
```

This corrected function decodes 'path' and 'base' to string if they are of type bytes, and then performs the necessary checks and operations.
