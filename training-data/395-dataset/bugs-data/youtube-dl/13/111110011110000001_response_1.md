The `test_urljoin` function is testing the `urljoin` function with different input combinations. The error message indicates that the test failed when calling `urljoin` with a `None` base URL and a non-None path, which resulted in the assertion error `None != 'rtmp://foo.de'`.

The potential error location within the `urljoin` function is the check for the base URL's type and the subsequent handling of `None` as the base URL. The function needs to handle `None` as the base URL and return the path as the complete URL.

The reason for the bug is that the original implementation of the `urljoin` function did not handle the case where the base URL is `None`.

To fix the bug, the `urljoin` function can be modified to explicitly handle the case where the base URL is `None`, and return the path as the complete URL.

Here's the corrected code for the `urljoin` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin as urlparse_urljoin

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:
        return None
    if base is None:
        return path
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, str) or not re.match(
            r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return urlparse_urljoin(base, path)
```

In this corrected code, when the base URL is `None`, the function simply returns the path as the complete URL, which addresses the bug that caused the assertion error in the test case.
