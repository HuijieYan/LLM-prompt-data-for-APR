The error in the `urljoin` function occurs due to the multiple checks for the type and format of the input parameters. The function goes through several conditional checks before the URL is joined, which results in incorrect outputs.

The potential error location within the function is the series of conditional statements that check the type and format of the input parameters. The use of `isinstance` and subsequent checks are not efficient and lead to errors in URL joining.

One of the main reasons behind the occurrence of the bug is the complicated conditional checks and type conversions, such as converting `bytes` to `utf-8` strings and then checking the type using `compat_str`. These complex operations make the function error-prone and lead to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the conditional checks and type conversions should be simplified. Checking for `None` values and unnecessary type conversions should be avoided.

Here's the corrected code for the `urljoin` function:

```python
import urllib.parse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if path is None or path == '':
        return None
    if base is None or base == '':
        return path
    if base.endswith('/') and path.startswith('/'):
        return base + path[1:]
    elif not base.endswith('/') and not path.startswith('/'):
        return base + '/' + path
    else:
        return urllib.parse.urljoin(base, path)
```

In this corrected function, the unnecessary type checks and conversions have been removed, and the URL joining logic has been simplified using the `urllib.parse.urljoin` method with appropriate checks for `None` and empty values.
