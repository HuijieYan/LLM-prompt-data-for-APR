Potential Error Location: The issue appears to be in the checks for the data type of `path` and `base` variables. The function is checking if `path` and `base` are instances of `bytes` and `compat_str` before executing the logic to join the URL.

Reasons for the Bug: The bug occurs because the initial checks for the data type of `path` and `base` are incorrect. The checks for `bytes` and `compat_str` are unnecessary and incorrect, leading to the function returning `None` in cases where it shouldn't.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: 
1. Remove the unnecessary checks for `bytes` and `compat_str`.
2. Update the condition for checking the validity of `path` and `base`.

Corrected Code:
```python
def urljoin(base, path):
    if not path or not base:  # check if path and base are not empty
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):  # check if path is an absolute URL
        return path
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):  # check if base is an absolute URL
        return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
    else:
        return None
```
