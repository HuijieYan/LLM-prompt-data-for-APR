Potential Error Location:
- The error could be occurring in the if statement checking the type of `path` and `base` variables.

Reasons for the Bug:
- The bug is likely due to the incorrect usage of the `compat_str` type and the missing import of the necessary libraries such as `re` and `compat_urlparse`.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Import the necessary libraries such as `re` and `compat_urlparse`.
2. Use `str` instead of `compat_str` for checking the type of variables.
3. Ensure that the base and path variables are of the correct types before performing any operations on them.

Corrected Code:

```python
import re
import urllib.parse as urlparse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, str) or not re.match(
            r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```
The corrected code addresses the issues by using the correct library for URL parsing (`urllib.parse`) and ensuring that the type checks are performed using `str` instead of `compat_str`.
