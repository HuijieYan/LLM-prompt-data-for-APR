The provided test case for the `urljoin` function aims to verify the behavior of the function with different input scenarios. The test case includes a wide range of input combinations, such as different types for the `base` and `path` parameters, including strings and bytes, as well as cases with `None` and empty strings.

The error message shows an `AssertionError` for the test case `urljoin(None, 'rtmp://foo.de')`. It indicates that the observed output is `None`, but the expected output is `'rtmp://foo.de'`.

The potential error location within the `urljoin` function is the handling of the `base` parameter. The function doesn't properly handle the case if the `base` parameter is `None`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function does not have proper handling for the `base` parameter when it is `None`. It should return `path` in this case, but it returns `None` instead, which causes the test case to fail.

To fix the bug, the function should check if `base` is `None` and return `path` in this case. Additionally, it can use the `urlparse` function to join the `base` and `path` together.

Here is the corrected code for the `urljoin` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin as urlparse_urljoin

def urljoin(base, path):
    if base is None:
        return path

    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not path or not isinstance(path, str):
        return None
    
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not base or not isinstance(base, str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    
    return urlparse_urljoin(base, path)
```
