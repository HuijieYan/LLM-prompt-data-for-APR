Potential error location: 
The main issue with the provided function is that it is not properly checking for the type of `path` and `base` before performing operations on them. Additionally, the function is attempting to use `re` and `compat_urlparse` without importing them first.

Reasons behind the bug:
1. The function does not check the type of `path` before performing operations on it, which can lead to errors if `path` is not of type `compat_str`.
2. The function attempts to use `re` and `compat_urlparse` without importing them first, which will lead to NameError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the type of `path` and `base` before performing any operations on them.
2. Import the necessary libraries `re` and `compat_urlparse` before using them in the function.

Corrected code:

```python
import re
from youtube_dl.compat import compat_str
import youtube_dl.compat_urlparse as compat_urlparse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, compat_str) or not re.match(
            r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```
