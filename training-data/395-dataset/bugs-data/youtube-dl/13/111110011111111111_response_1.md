The error occurs at the test case `self.assertEqual(urljoin(None, 'rtmp://foo.de'), 'rtmp://foo.de')` where the expected result is `rtmp://foo.de` but the actual result is `None`.

The potential error location could be in the part of the function that handles the case when the base URL is None. The function fails to handle this case properly and returns None instead of the input path.

The bug occurred because the URL's base was not properly handled. The function should return the path if the base is None. 

To fix the bug, we need to check if the base URL is None, and if so, simply return the given path. 

The corrected code for the problematic function `urljoin` is as follows:

```python
import re
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def urljoin(base, path):
    if base is None:
        return path
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, str) or not re.match(
            r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return urljoin(base, path)
```
