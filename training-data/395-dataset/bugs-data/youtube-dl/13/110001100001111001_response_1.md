The potential error in the provided function is in the section where it checks the type of the input parameters. The function is supposed to handle both strings and bytes as input parameters, but the type checking and handling of bytes is not implemented correctly.

It appears that the function is trying to handle bytes inputs by decoding them to strings using `path.decode('utf-8')` and `base.decode('utf-8')`. However, this approach is inconsistent and may lead to unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, the function should handle bytes inputs consistently and without relying on manual decoding. Instead, it should check the type of the input parameters using Python's `isinstance` function and handle bytes inputs appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `urljoin` function:

```python
import re
from youtube_dl.compat import (
    compat_str,
    compat_urlparse
)

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, compat_str) or not re.match(
            r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```

This corrected function handles both string and bytes inputs correctly and should work as expected for all the provided test cases.
