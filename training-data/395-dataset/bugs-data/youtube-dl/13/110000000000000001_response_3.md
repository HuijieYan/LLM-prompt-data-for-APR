Potential error location: 
The `compat_str` and `compat_urlparse` are not defined within the function, which will cause a NameError when the function is called.

Reason behind the bug:
The `compat_str` and `compat_urlparse` seems to be custom classes or modules that are not imported or defined within the function. This causes the NameError when the function is called.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Import the required modules and classes within the function.
2. Use the correct built-in classes and modules instead of custom ones.

Corrected code:

```python
import re
from urllib.parse import urljoin as urlparse_urljoin, urlparse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:  # Changed compat_str to str
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, str) or not re.match(
            r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return urlparse_urljoin(base, path)  # Changed compat_urlparse.urljoin to urlparse_urljoin
```
