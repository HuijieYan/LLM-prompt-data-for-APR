The error message "AssertionError: None != 'rtmp://foo.de'" occurs when the test case urljoin(None, 'rtmp://foo.de') is executed. This suggests that the urljoin function is returning None instead of the expected 'rtmp://foo.de'.

The potential error in the problematic function is within the conditionals that check for the type of the path and base variables. These conditionals are not handling the cases properly, leading to incorrect return values.

The bug occurs because the isinstance function is not correctly handling the type checking for the path and base variables. Additionally, the conditionals are not structured properly to handle all the different input types and cases, leading to incorrect return values.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the type checking conditionals to correctly handle the different input types, and adjust the logic to handle all edge cases for the path and base variables.

Here's the corrected code for the urljoin function:

```python
import re
from urllib.parse import urljoin as compat_urlparse_urljoin

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, str) or not re.match(
            r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse_urljoin(base, path)
```
