The error in the function `get_elements_by_attribute` is causing the test case `test_get_element_by_attribute` to fail. The error message indicates that the function is returning `None` instead of the expected result.

The potential error in the function is within the `for` loop where it is trying to match and extract the content of the tag with the specified attribute in the passed HTML document. The `retlist` is not being populated correctly, which leads to the function returning `None` instead of the content of the tag.

The reason behind this bug is that the regular expression used for matching the content of the tag with the specified attribute might not be working as intended. It is failing to extract the content of the tag within the given HTML document.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the regular expression pattern and ensure that it correctly captures and returns the content of the tag with the specified attribute.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_elements_by_attribute` function:

```python
import re

def get_elements_by_attribute(attribute, value, html, escape_value=True):
    """Return the content of the tag with the specified attribute in the passed HTML document"""

    value = re.escape(value) if escape_value else value
    
    retlist = []
    pattern = r'<([a-zA-Z0-9:._-]+)\s+[^>]*?\b{0}\s*=\s*([\'"])({1})(?P<content>.*?)\2[^>]*?>(.*?)</\1>'.format(re.escape(attribute), value)
    
    for m in re.finditer(pattern, html):
        res = m.group('content')
        retlist.append(unescapeHTML(res))
    
    return retlist
```

In the modified code, the regular expression pattern is updated to correctly capture the content of the tag with the specified attribute. This should fix the bug and make the function return the expected results for the test case.
