The error message indicates that the function `get_element_by_attribute` is not returning the correct value. This suggests that the function is not correctly identifying and extracting the content of the HTML tag with the specified attribute.

Looking into the buggy function, the potential error is in the regular expression used to extract the content of the tag with the specified attribute. The regular expression pattern is matching the content incorrectly, resulting in the wrong value being returned.

The bug occurs due to the incorrect regular expression pattern which is not accurately identifying and extracting the content of the specified attribute.

To fix the bug, the regular expression pattern needs to be modified to correctly match and capture the content of the specified attribute. Additionally, the processing of the captured content may need to be adjusted to ensure the correct output.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_elements_by_attribute` function:

```python
import re
from html import unescape

def get_elements_by_attribute(attribute, value, html, escape_value=True):
    """Return the content of the tag with the specified attribute in the passed HTML document"""

    value = re.escape(value) if escape_value else value

    retlist = []
    pattern = r'<([a-zA-Z0-9:._-]+)[^>]*\b%s\s*=\s*["\']?%s[^>]*>(.*?)</\1>' % (re.escape(attribute), value)
    for m in re.finditer(pattern, html):
        res = unescape(m.group(2))
        retlist.append(res)

    return retlist
```

In the corrected code, the regular expression pattern has been modified to accurately capture the content of the specified attribute. Additionally, the captured content is processed using `unescape` to ensure the correct output.

With this corrected code, the `get_elements_by_attribute` function should now return the expected values for the given test cases.
