The issue with the function `get_elements_by_attribute` is that it uses the `re.escape` method to escape the `value` parameter, but this method adds backslashes before characters that need to be escaped in regular expressions. This does not align with the expected behavior of the function.

Based on the test cases provided:
- Buggy case 1: The value `foo bar` is converted to `foo\ bar`, which is not the intent.
- Buggy case 2: No items are returned in the list, indicating a potential issue with how the regular expression is matching.
- Buggy case 3: The value `no-such-foo` is converted to `no\-such\-foo` which is not correct.
- Buggy case 4: The regular expression successfully matches the content, but the escaping logic and the list of extracted items are incorrect.

To fix this, you need to modify the regular expression pattern and the escape handling.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re
import html

def get_elements_by_attribute(attribute, value, html, escape_value=True):
    """Return the content of the tag with the specified attribute in the passed HTML document"""

    if escape_value:
        value = re.escape(value)

    pattern = r'<([a-zA-Z0-9:._-]+)\s+[^>]*' + attribute + '=[\'"]?' + value + '[\'"]?[^>]*>(.*?)</\1>'
    retlist = re.findall(pattern, html, re.DOTALL)

    return [html.unescape(item[1]) for item in retlist]

```

In this corrected version:
- We use `re.escape` based on the `escape_value` flag to escape the value only if necessary.
- We construct a new regular expression pattern with the attribute and value parameters.
- We use `re.findall` to directly find all matches, and then unescape the HTML entities in the matched content.
