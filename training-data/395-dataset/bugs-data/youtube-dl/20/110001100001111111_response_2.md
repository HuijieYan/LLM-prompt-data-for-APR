The bug in the function `get_elements_by_attribute` is likely related to the regular expression used to extract content based on a specific attribute in HTML. The bug occurs when the regular expression does not match the input HTML.

The regular expression used to match the HTML content is quite complex and may result in mismatches when dealing with various types of input HTML. This can cause the `retlist` to be either empty or contain unexpected values.

To fix the bug, it's important to ensure that the regular expression used is correctly capturing the desired content. Additionally, it would be beneficial to handle cases where the regular expression does not find a match in the input HTML.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_elements_by_attribute` function:

```python
import re
from html import unescape

def get_elements_by_attribute(attribute, value, html, escape_value=True):
    """Return the content of the tag with the specified attribute in the passed HTML document"""

    # Construct the attribute pattern based on the escape_value flag
    escaped_value = re.escape(value) if escape_value else value
    attribute_pattern = fr'\b{attribute}=["\'](.*?){escaped_value}(.*?)(?<!\\)["\']'

    # Find all occurrences of the attribute pattern in the HTML
    match_results = re.findall(attribute_pattern, html)

    retlist = []

    # Extract content from the matching elements
    for match in match_results:
        content = match[0]
        # Remove leading and trailing quotes from the content
        content = content.strip('"\'')

        # Unescape the HTML content
        content = unescape(content)

        retlist.append(content)

    return retlist
```

In the corrected code:
- The regular expression pattern is simplified to capture attribute values without using a complex match pattern with HTML tag structure.
- The `re.findall` function is used to find all occurrences of the attribute pattern in the HTML.
- Content is extracted from the matching elements and unescaped using the `unescape` function from the `html` module.
- The extracted content is then added to the `retlist` for return.
