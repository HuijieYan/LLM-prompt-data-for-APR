The potential error in the buggy function `get_elements_by_attribute` is in the regular expression that searches for the content of specific HTML elements with a given attribute. The bug occurs because the regular expression is not correctly matching the HTML content, resulting in incorrect parsing and extraction of the content.

The bug occurs because the regular expression pattern is not correctly formatted to identify and capture the content within HTML tags with the specified attribute. This leads to incorrect extraction of the content and can result in missing or incomplete values.

To fix the bug:
1. Adjust the regular expression pattern to correctly capture the content within HTML tags with the specified attribute.
2. Use named capturing groups in the regular expression to directly extract the content without additional manipulation.
3. Ensure that the regular expression pattern accounts for various formatting and attribute value types in HTML.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_elements_by_attribute` function:

```python
import re

def get_elements_by_attribute(attribute, value, html, escape_value=True):
    value = re.escape(value) if escape_value else value

    pattern = r'<([a-zA-Z0-9:._-]+)\s+(?:[^>]*?\s+{0}="[^"]*")[^>]*?>(?P<content>.*?)</\1>'.format(attribute)
    
    retlist = [m.group('content') for m in re.finditer(pattern, html)]
    
    return retlist
```

The corrected code uses a more specific and structured regular expression pattern to capture the content within HTML tags with the specified attribute. It also uses a named capturing group to directly extract the content, simplifying the code.
