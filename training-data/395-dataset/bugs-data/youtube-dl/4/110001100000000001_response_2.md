The potential error in the problematic function is in the use of the `allow_recursion` variable. The variable is being passed around without being decremented properly, and it seems like the intention is to use it as a limit for recursion. 

The current code does not properly handle the `allow_recursion` limit, which can potentially lead to infinite recursion and cause the program to crash.

To fix the bug, the `allow_recursion` variable needs to be decremented when passing it to recursive calls and additional checks need to be added to stop recursion when the limit is reached.

Here's the corrected code for the `interpret_expression` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def interpret_expression(self, expr, local_vars, allow_recursion):
    if allow_recursion <= 0:
        # limit for recursion reached, raise an error or handle it as appropriate
        raise ExtractorError('Recursion limit reached')
    
    # decrease the recursion limit
    allow_recursion -= 1

    # rest of the function's code remains the same
    ...
```

In this corrected function, we added a condition to check if the recursion limit has been reached. If the limit is reached, an error can be raised or handled in a suitable manner. We also decremented the recursion limit each time the function is called recursively. These changes ensure that the function will not exceed the recursion limit and avoid potential crashes due to infinite recursion.
