The error occurs in the `interpret_expression` method of the `JSInterpreter` class when it encounters the expression 'x()'. This expression is not properly handled and leads to the raising of the 'Unsupported JS expression' error.

The potential error location is within the code block that attempts to match and handle function calls in the expression. It seems that the current implementation does not handle function calls in the expected way, leading to the error.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function call pattern is not being properly identified and processed in the `interpret_expression` method. This results in unsupported expression error when encountering the function call 'x()'.

To fix the bug, the function call pattern should be correctly identified and processed within the `interpret_expression` method, considering the arguments and handling the function execution. Additionally, the case for function calls should be properly handled to avoid raising the 'Unsupported JS expression' error.

Here's the corrected code for the `interpret_expression` method:

```python
def interpret_expression(self, expr, local_vars, allow_recursion):
    expr = expr.strip()

    if expr == '':  # Empty expression
        return None

    # Handle function calls
    if '(' in expr and expr.endswith(')'):
        func_name, args = expr.split('(', 1)
        args = args[:-1]  # Remove the closing parenthesis
        if func_name in self._functions:
            argvals = tuple([
                int(v) if v.isdigit() else local_vars[v]
                for v in args.split(',')
            ])
            return self._functions[func_name](argvals)

    # Existing code for other types of expressions goes here...

    raise ExtractorError('Unsupported JS expression %r' % expr)
```

This corrected code properly handles function calls by splitting the expression into the function name and its arguments, then checking if the function is present in the `_functions` dictionary. If present, it processes the function call and returns the result. Otherwise, it raises the same 'Unsupported JS expression' error.
