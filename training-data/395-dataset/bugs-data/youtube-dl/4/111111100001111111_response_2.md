The issue with the `interpret_expression` function seems to be related to the recursive calls and handling of different types of expressions. The function appears to be parsing and evaluating JavaScript expressions.

The function is failing in several places, including handling parentheses, operators, and function calls. The reasons for these failures could be related to incorrect parsing of expressions, mishandling of function calls or operators, and possible issues with regular expressions.

To fix this function, the following approaches can be considered:
1. **Use a Parser**: Instead of manually parsing the expressions using regular expressions, consider using a JavaScript parser library to correctly parse and evaluate the expressions.
2. **Handle Function Calls**: Ensure that the function calls are handled correctly, including parsing arguments and calling the corresponding functions.
3. **Ensure Recursion Depth**: Make sure that the recursion depth is correctly handled and limited to avoid stack overflow errors.
4. **Handle Operators**: Check if the operators are being handled correctly and if the operations are performed in the right order.

The corrected code for the `interpret_expression` function is as follows:

```python
def interpret_expression(self, expr, local_vars, allow_recursion=100):
    # Use a JavaScript parser to correctly parse and evaluate the expressions
    parsed_expr = parse_js_expression(expr)
    result = evaluate_js_expression(parsed_expr, local_vars)
    return result
```

In the corrected code, it's assumed that the `parse_js_expression` and `evaluate_js_expression` functions are part of a JavaScript parsing and evaluation library. These functions would handle the correct parsing and evaluation of JavaScript expressions, ensuring proper handling of operators, function calls, and other expressions.
