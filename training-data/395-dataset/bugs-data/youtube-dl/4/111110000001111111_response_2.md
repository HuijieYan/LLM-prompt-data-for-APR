The bug in the `interpret_expression` function seems to be related to the assignment operations using regex that are trying to access the `op` and `opfunc` variables from the `_ASSIGN_OPERATORS` list, but the matching condition is not being satisfied and the function doesn't return anything in these cases.

The bug occurs because the code doesn't handle all the possible paths that the input expression can take, resulting in some paths not returning a value and potentially leading to the function not returning anything at all.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to ensure that the function returns a value in all possible code paths. This may involve adding additional return statements and handling edge cases where a match is not found using the regular expressions.

Here's the corrected code for the `interpret_expression` function:

```python
def interpret_expression(self, expr, local_vars, allow_recursion):
    expr = expr.strip()

    if expr == '':  # Empty expression
        return None

    # ... (other code)

    for op, opfunc in _ASSIGN_OPERATORS:
        m = re.match(r'''(?x)
            (?P<out>%s)(?:\[(?P<index>[^\]]+?)\])?
            \s*%s
            (?P<expr>.*)$''' % (_NAME_RE, re.escape(op)), expr)
        if m:
            right_val = self.interpret_expression(
                m.group('expr'), local_vars, allow_recursion - 1)

            if m.groupdict().get('index'):
                lvar = local_vars[m.group('out')]
                idx = self.interpret_expression(
                    m.group('index'), local_vars, allow_recursion)
                assert isinstance(idx, int)
                cur = lvar[idx]
                val = opfunc(cur, right_val)
                lvar[idx] = val
                return val
            else:
                cur = local_vars.get(m.group('out'))
                val = opfunc(cur, right_val)
                local_vars[m.group('out')] = val
                return val

    # ... (other code)

    return None  # Return None if no other condition is met
```

This corrected code includes an additional return statement at the end of the function to ensure that a value is always returned, even if none of the specific conditions are met. Any logic around handling edge cases or non-matching conditions should be revisited and adjusted as needed to ensure that the function behaves as expected for all input cases.
