The error message indicates that the function `interpret_expression` encountered an unsupported JS expression 'x()'. This error is likely occurring because the function fails to handle the case where a function is called with arguments.

Upon analyzing the code, it seems that there is a section of code that attempts to handle function calls with arguments, but it is not handling all possible cases and may be missing certain scenarios where the function is called with arguments.

To fix this bug, the `interpret_expression` function needs to be updated to properly handle function calls with arguments. This can be achieved by parsing the function call expression and extracting the function name and its arguments separately. Then, the function should check whether the function is callable and proceed with evaluating the function with the provided arguments.

Here's the corrected code for the `interpret_expression` function:

```python
def interpret_expression(self, expr, local_vars, allow_recursion):
    expr = expr.strip()

    if expr == '':  # Empty expression
        return None

    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    # Function call
    m = re.match(
        r'(?P<func>%s)\((?P<args>.*)\)$' % _NAME_RE, expr)
    if m:
        fname = m.group('func')
        arg_str = m.group('args')
        
        if fname not in self._functions:
            self._functions[fname] = self.extract_function(fname)

        if arg_str == '':
            argvals = tuple()
        else:
            argvals = tuple([
                self.interpret_expression(v, local_vars, allow_recursion)
                for v in arg_str.split(',')])
        
        return self._functions[fname](argvals)

    # issue a warning for unsupported expressions
    raise ExtractorError('Unsupported JS expression %r' % expr)
```

With this fix, the `interpret_expression` function should now be able to handle function calls with arguments correctly, and the error encountered during the test should be resolved.
