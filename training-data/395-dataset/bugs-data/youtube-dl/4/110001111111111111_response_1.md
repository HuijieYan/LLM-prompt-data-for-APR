The error message "Unsupported JS expression 'x()'" indicates that the buggy function `interpret_expression` is unable to handle the expression `x()`.

Upon further analysis, the error seems to occur in the section responsible for processing function calls. The regular expression and conditional logic for handling function calls may not be comprehensive enough to cover all cases, resulting in an unsupported expression error.

One potential approach for fixing this bug is to review the regular expression and conditional logic for function calls, ensuring that it covers various function call scenarios, including those with arguments and those without.

Furthermore, the function can be refactored to improve readability and maintainability. It can be divided into smaller, more focused sub-functions for handling specific expression types, such as function calls, variable access, and arithmetic operations.

Below is the corrected code for the `interpret_expression` function:

```python
import json

def interpret_expression(self, expr, local_vars, allow_recursion):
    # Existing code...
    # ...

    m = re.match(
        r'(?P<func>%s)\((?P<args>.*)\)$' % _NAME_RE, expr)
    if m:
        fname = m.group('func')
        arg_str = m.group('args')
        
        if fname in self._functions:
            argvals = []
            for arg in arg_str.split(','):
                arg = arg.strip()
                if arg.isdigit():
                    argvals.append(int(arg))
                elif arg in local_vars:
                    argvals.append(local_vars[arg])
                else:
                    try:
                        argvals.append(json.loads(arg))
                    except ValueError:
                        raise ExtractorError('Unsupported argument %r for function %r' % (arg, fname))
            
            return self._functions[fname](*argvals)
        else:
            raise ExtractorError('Function %r is not defined' % fname)

    # Existing code...
    # ...
```

This corrected code improves the handling of function calls by properly parsing the arguments using a more robust approach, while also providing clearer error messages for unsupported functions or arguments.
