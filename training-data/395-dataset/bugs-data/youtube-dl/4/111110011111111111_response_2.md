The error occurs in the `interpret_expression` method of the `JSInterpreter` class. The error message "Unsupported JS expression 'x()'" indicates that the function is unable to handle the expression 'x()'. This is likely due to the `m = re.match(...)` section not matching 'x()' correctly and falling through to the final exception raise.

Upon analyzing the code and the input values, it seems that the regular expressions used for matching expressions are not covering all the possible cases, leading to the unsupported expression error.

A possible approach to fix the bug is to review and improve the regular expressions used in the function to ensure that they cover all the possible expression patterns and handle function calls, member accesses, and other operations accordingly.

Here is the corrected code for the `interpret_expression` method:

```python
def interpret_expression(self, expr, local_vars, allow_recursion):
    expr = expr.strip()

    if expr == '':
        return None

    # Regular expression matching for function calls
    m = re.match(
        r'^(?P<func>%s)\((?P<args>.*)\)$' % _NAME_RE, expr)
    if m:
        fname = m.group('func')
        args = m.group('args').split(',')

        if fname in self._functions:
            argvals = []
            for arg in args:
                arg = arg.strip()
                if arg.isdigit():
                    argvals.append(int(arg))
                else:
                    argvals.append(local_vars[arg])

            return self._functions[fname](argvals)

    # Remaining code for variable access, operations, etc...
    ...
```

In the corrected code, the regular expression for function calls has been updated to properly match function names and their respective arguments, ensuring that the function calls are handled correctly. Additionally, the existing code for variable access, operations, etc. remains unchanged.
