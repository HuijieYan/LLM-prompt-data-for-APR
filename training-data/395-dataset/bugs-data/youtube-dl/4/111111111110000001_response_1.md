The test case `test_call` is trying to call a function `z` using the `call_function` method of the `JSInterpreter` class and expects the result to be 5. However, during the execution of the `call_function` method, an `ExtractorError` is raised with the message "Unsupported JS expression 'x()'". This indicates that there might be an issue with the interpretation of the JavaScript expression within the `interpret_expression` method of the `JSInterpreter` class.

Upon analyzing the code, it seems that the issue might be related to the parsing of the JavaScript expression and the execution of function calls within that expression.

The potential cause of the bug is that the handling of function calls within the `interpret_expression` method is not properly implemented. When a function call is encountered, the method should parse the arguments and invoke the relevant function, but the current implementation is not doing this effectively, leading to the unsupported expression error.

To fix the bug, the `interpret_expression` method should be modified to correctly handle function calls and their arguments, ensuring that the functions are invoked with the appropriate arguments.

Here's the corrected code for the `interpret_expression` method:

```python
def interpret_expression(self, expr, local_vars, allow_recursion):
    expr = expr.strip()

    # ... (other parts of the method remain unchanged) ...

    # Regular expression to match function calls
    m = re.match(
        r'^(?P<func>%s)\((?P<args>[a-zA-Z0-9_$,]*)\)$' % _NAME_RE, expr)
    if m:
        # Extract function name and arguments
        fname = m.group('func')
        arg_str = m.group('args').split(',')

        # Retrieve the function from _functions dictionary
        if fname in self._functions:
            func = self._functions[fname]
            # Convert argument names to values and call the function
            argvals = tuple([
                int(v) if v.isdigit() else local_vars[v]
                for v in arg_str
            ])
            return func(argvals)
        else:
            raise ExtractorError('Function %r not found' % fname)

    # ... (remaining parts of the method) ...
```

In the corrected code, we use a regular expression to match function calls and their arguments. If a match is found, we extract the function name and arguments, and then convert the argument names to their corresponding values using the `local_vars` dictionary. Finally, we call the function with the arguments and return the result.

This modification should properly handle function calls within JavaScript expressions and resolve the unsupported expression error.
