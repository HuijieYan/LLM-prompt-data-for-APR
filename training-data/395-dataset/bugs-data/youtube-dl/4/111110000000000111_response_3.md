The potential error in the code is due to the missing import statement for the 're' module as the code uses methods from the 're' module but does not import it.

In order to fix the bug, the 're' module needs to be imported at the beginning of the file using the following import statement:

```python
import re
```

This will allow the code to use the regular expression functions defined in the 're' module within the 'interpret_expression' method.

Here's the corrected code with the import statement added:

```python
import re

# class declaration containing the buggy function
class JSInterpreter(object):
    # ... omitted code ...


    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def interpret_statement(self, stmt, local_vars, allow_recursion=100):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def interpret_expression(self, expr, local_vars, allow_recursion):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def extract_object(self, objname):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def extract_function(self, funcname):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass



    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def interpret_expression(self, expr, local_vars, allow_recursion):
        expr = expr.strip()
        # ... rest of the function remains unchanged ...
```
