Based on the given test case and the error message, it seems that the bug is occurring when the function `interpret_expression` encounters the expression 'x()' and identifies it as an unsupported JavaScript expression.

The potential error location within the problematic function is most likely the if condition that checks for unsupported JS expression.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is unable to handle JavaScript function calls properly.

To fix the bug, the function `interpret_expression` should be updated to handle JavaScript function calls correctly. It should identify function calls and execute them using the provided arguments.

```python
def interpret_expression(self, expr, local_vars, allow_recursion):
    expr = expr.strip()

    if expr == '':  # Empty expression
        return None

    # other code to handle various cases ...

    m = re.match(
        r'(?P<func>%s)\((?P<args>[a-zA-Z0-9_$,]+)\)$' % _NAME_RE, expr)
    if m:
        fname = m.group('func')
        argvals = tuple([
            int(v) if v.isdigit() else local_vars[v]
            for v in m.group('args').split(',')])
        if fname in self._functions:
            return self._functions[fname](*argvals)
        else:
            raise ExtractorError('Unsupported JS expression %r' % expr)

    raise ExtractorError('Unsupported JS expression %r' % expr)
```

In the updated `interpret_expression` function, the expression is checked for a function call pattern. If it matches, the arguments are extracted and the function associated with the provided name is called with the arguments. If the function doesn't exist, it raises an error for an unsupported JS expression.
