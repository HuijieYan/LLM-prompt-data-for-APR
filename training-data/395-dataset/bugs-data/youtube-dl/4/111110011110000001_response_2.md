The error message indicates that the buggy function `interpret_expression` is encountering an unsupported JS expression `'x()'`. This suggests that the function is unable to handle the function call in the given JavaScript code.

The potential error location within the problematic function is at the point where it tries to handle function calls. The error occurs because the function handling logic is not comprehensive and does not cover all possible use cases.

The bug occurs because the function handling logic within the `interpret_expression` method is incomplete and does not account for all possible scenarios, especially when dealing with function calls and their arguments.

To fix the bug, the `interpret_expression` method should be updated to handle function calls and their arguments more comprehensively. This may involve parsing the function call expression, extracting the function name and its arguments, and then invoking the corresponding function with the provided arguments.

The corrected code for the problematic function `interpret_expression` is provided below:

```python
def interpret_expression(self, expr, local_vars, allow_recursion):
    expr = expr.strip()

    # ... (existing code)

    m = re.match(
        r'^(?P<func>%s)\((?P<args>[^\)]*)\)$' % _NAME_RE, expr)
    if m:
        fname = m.group('func')
        argvals = tuple([
            self.interpret_expression(v, local_vars, allow_recursion)
            for v in m.group('args').split(',')])

        if fname not in self._functions:
            self._functions[fname] = self.extract_function(fname)
        return self._functions[fname](argvals)

    # ... (existing code)
```

In the corrected code, the function call handling logic has been updated to parse the function name and its arguments from the expression, then invoke the corresponding function with the provided arguments. This would ensure that the `interpret_expression` method can handle function calls more comprehensively and avoid the unsupported JS expression error encountered in the test case.
