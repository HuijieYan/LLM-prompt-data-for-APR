The error occurs because the 'interpret_expression' function is unable to process the expression 'x()', as it doesn't recognize it as a supported JavaScript expression. This is likely due to a missing or incomplete implementation for handling function calls in the code.

To fix the bug, the 'interpret_expression' function needs to be updated to properly handle function calls and process them according to JavaScript semantics. This may involve checking for function names, mapping them to their corresponding definitions, and then executing the function with the provided arguments.

Here's the corrected code for the 'interpret_expression' function:

```python
def interpret_expression(self, expr, local_vars, allow_recursion):
    # ... omitted code ...

    m = re.match(
        r'^(?P<func>%s)\((?P<args>.+)\)$' % _NAME_RE, expr)
    if m:
        fname = m.group('func')
        argvals = m.group('args').split(',')
        if fname in self._functions:
            return self._functions[fname](argvals)
        else:
            raise ExtractorError('Function %r is not defined' % fname)

    # ... remaining code for handling other types of expressions ...
```

In the corrected code, a regular expression is used to match and extract the function name and its arguments from the expression. If the function is defined in the '_functions' dictionary, it is invoked with the provided arguments. Otherwise, an error is raised to indicate that the function is not defined.

This updated logic ensures that function calls are properly handled and executed within the 'interpret_expression' function.
