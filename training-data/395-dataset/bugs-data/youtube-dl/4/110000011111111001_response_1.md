The error in the problematic function seems to stem from the handling of function calls and their arguments. It attempts to match the function call pattern and its arguments, but it fails to do so in one of the test cases, leading to the "Unsupported JS expression" error.

The reason behind the bug occurrence is most likely related to the regular expression patterns used to match function calls and their arguments. The function's logic for handling function calls and their arguments seems to be incorrect, causing it to not appropriately handle the function call in one of the test cases.

To fix the bug, the regular expression patterns for matching function calls and their arguments need to be reviewed and potentially revised to ensure they capture all possible valid function call patterns. Additionally, the logic for handling function calls and their arguments within the function should be thoroughly reviewed and adjusted to handle various scenarios.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re
import json
from youtube_dl.utils import ExtractorError

def interpret_expression(self, expr, local_vars, allow_recursion):
    expr = expr.strip()

    if expr == '':  # Empty expression
        return None

    # match and handle function calls
    m = re.match(r'(?P<func>%s)\((?P<args>.*)\)$' % _NAME_RE, expr)
    if m:
        fname = m.group('func')
        argvals = tuple([
            int(v) if v.isdigit() else local_vars[v]
            for v in m.group('args').split(',')])

        if fname in self._functions:
            return self._functions[fname](argvals)
        else:
            raise ExtractorError('Unsupported function call: %s' % fname)

    # handle other types of expressions...
    # ... (remaining logic for handling other types of expressions)

    raise ExtractorError('Unsupported JS expression %r' % expr)
```

In the corrected code, the handling of function calls has been revised and simplified. The regular expression pattern has been adjusted to capture the function call pattern, and the logic for handling function calls and their arguments has been updated to properly invoke the corresponding function. Additionally, if the function called is not found in `_functions`, it will raise an `ExtractorError` indicating an unsupported function call.
