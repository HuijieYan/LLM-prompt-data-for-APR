The error occurs when the test case calls the `JSInterpreter` object's `call_function` method with the argument 'z'. This method tries to call the function 'z', which in turn tries to call the function 'y(3)', and then 'x()' within the function 'y'. 

The problem seems to be within the `interpret_expression` method. It appears that there is an issue with correctly interpreting function calls and their arguments.

The reason for the bug is that the method is not handling function calls properly and is unable to interpret the expressions containing function calls and their arguments.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `interpret_expression` method to correctly handle function calls with their respective arguments and ensure proper interpretation of the expressions.

Here's the corrected code for the `interpret_expression` method:

```python
def interpret_expression(self, expr, local_vars, allow_recursion):
        #... existing code ...

        m = re.match(
            r'^(?P<func>%s)\((?P<args>.*)\)$' % _NAME_RE, expr)
        if m:
            fname = m.group('func')
            arg_str = m.group('args')
            if arg_str == '':
                argvals = tuple()
            else:
                argvals = tuple([
                    self.interpret_expression(v, local_vars, allow_recursion)
                    for v in arg_str.split(',') if v.strip() != ''
                ])
            if fname not in self._functions:
                self._functions[fname] = self.extract_function(fname)
            return self._functions[fname](argvals)
        
        #... remaining existing code ...
```

With this fix, the method can now correctly handle function calls and their arguments, ensuring the proper interpretation of expressions involving function calls.
