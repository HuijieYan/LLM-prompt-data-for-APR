The error message is indicating that the unsupported JS expression `x()` is causing an `ExtractorError`. This suggests that there might be an issue with the handling of function calls within the `interpret_expression` method.

The potential error location is the handling of function calls within the `interpret_expression` method. The code should be able to handle function calls correctly, but it is currently raising an `ExtractorError` instead.

The bug occurs because the function handling inside the `interpret_expression` method is not comprehensive enough to properly interpret and execute the function calls.

To fix the bug, the function handling logic needs to be updated to correctly parse and execute function calls, including passing and handling arguments.

Here's the corrected code for the `interpret_expression` method:

```python
def interpret_expression(self, expr, local_vars, allow_recursion):
    expr = expr.strip()

    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    m = re.match(
        r'^(?P<func>%s)\((?P<args>.*)\)$' % _NAME_RE, expr)
    if m:
        func_name = m.group('func')
        arg_str = m.group('args')

        if func_name in self._functions:
            argvals = []
            if arg_str:
                argvals = [self.interpret_expression(v.strip(), local_vars, allow_recursion) for v in arg_str.split(',')]
            return self._functions[func_name](*argvals)

    # ... (other code remains unchanged)
    
    raise ExtractorError('Unsupported JS expression %r' % expr)
```

In the corrected code, a new block is added to handle function calls. It uses regular expressions to match and extract the function name and arguments. Then, it checks if the function is available in the `_functions` dictionary and proceeds to execute it with the provided arguments.

This change should allow the method to properly interpret and execute function calls, resolving the issue that was causing the `ExtractorError`.
