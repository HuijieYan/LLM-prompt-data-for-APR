The error message indicates the occurrence of an "Unsupported JS expression" when the function encounters `x()` in the expression `y(3)` from the test case. This suggests that the function is unable to handle function calls within the expression.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the section that tries to handle function calls and their arguments in the `interpret_expression` method.

The reason behind the bug is that the function does not have a comprehensive mechanism to handle function calls and their arguments within the JavaScript expressions.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to explicitly handle function calls and their arguments within the `interpret_expression` method. This can be achieved by identifying function calls, extracting the function name and its arguments, and then invoking the corresponding function while passing the arguments.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def interpret_expression(self, expr, local_vars, allow_recursion):
        expr = expr.strip()

        # ... previous code ...

        m = re.match(
            r'^(?P<func>%s)\((?P<args>[^()]+)\)$' % _NAME_RE, expr)
        if m:
            fname = m.group('func')
            arg_str = m.group('args')

            if arg_str == '':
                argvals = tuple()
            else:
                argvals = tuple([
                    self.interpret_expression(v, local_vars, allow_recursion)
                    for v in arg_str.split(',')])

            if fname in self._functions:
                return self._functions[fname](argvals)
            else:
                raise ExtractorError('Undefined function %r' % fname)

        # ... remaining code ...

        raise ExtractorError('Unsupported JS expression %r' % expr)
```

In the corrected code, the function now properly handles function calls and their arguments within JavaScript expressions, resolves the function name, processes the arguments, and invokes the corresponding function while passing the arguments. Additionally, if the function is not defined, it raises an `ExtractorError` with an appropriate message.
