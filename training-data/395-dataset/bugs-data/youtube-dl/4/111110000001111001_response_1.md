The bug in the `interpret_expression` function seems to be related to the handling of the expressions and operators. 

In each of the given cases, the expressions are not properly processed due to issues with parsing and execution of the operations. This is causing the function to return incorrect values.

The function should be fixed by properly handling the parsing and execution of operations, as well as handling the different types of expressions that are encountered.

Here's the corrected `interpret_expression` function:

```python
def interpret_expression(self, expr, local_vars, allow_recursion):
    # ... existing code ...

    if expr.isdigit():
        return int(expr)

    if expr in local_vars:
        return local_vars[expr]

    try:
        return json.loads(expr)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    # ... remaining code ...
```

In this corrected version, the function checks if the expression is a digit or an existing variable in `local_vars`. If it is a digit, it returns the integer value of the expression. If it is a variable in `local_vars`, it returns the value of that variable. Otherwise, it attempts to parse the expression as JSON and returns the result.

This approach should handle a wider range of expressions and variables, addressing the issues observed in the buggy cases.
