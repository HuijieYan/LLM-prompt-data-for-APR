The issue in the buggy function seems to be arising from the handling of function calls within the `interpret_expression` method. When the expression contains a function call, the method attempts to call the function using the arguments provided. However, the way it handles different function calls and their arguments is leading to the unsupported expression error.

The reason behind this bug could be that the function call handling logic is not comprehensive enough to cover all possible cases of function calls and their arguments.

To fix this bug, the `interpret_expression` method needs to be modified to handle function calls and their arguments more accurately. Additionally, the way it identifies different types of expressions (e.g., variables, function calls, operations) should be reviewed and updated for better coverage.

Here is the corrected code for the `interpret_expression` method after addressing the identified issues:

```python
def interpret_expression(self, expr, local_vars, allow_recursion):
    expr = expr.strip()

    # Existing code for handling empty expressions and parentheses

    # Handle function calls
    m = re.match(
        r'(?P<func>%s)\((?P<args>.*?)\)$' % _NAME_RE, expr)
    if m:
        fname = m.group('func')
        argvals = [
            self.interpret_expression(v, local_vars, allow_recursion)
            for v in m.group('args').split(',')]
        if fname in self._functions:
            return self._functions[fname](argvals)
        else:
            raise ExtractorError('Function %s is not defined' % fname)

    # Existing code for handling variable access, literals, etc.

    # If none of the above conditions are met, raise an error
    raise ExtractorError('Unsupported JS expression %r' % expr)
```

In the corrected code:
- The function now uses a more comprehensive regular expression pattern to identify function calls and their arguments.
- It checks if the function being called is defined in the `_functions` dictionary. If not, it raises an error indicating that the function is not defined.

This approach provides a more robust solution for handling function calls and their arguments within the `interpret_expression` method.
