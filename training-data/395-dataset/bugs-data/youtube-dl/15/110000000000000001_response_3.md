The potential error location within the problematic function is the regular expression patterns and the fix_kv function.

The bug occurs because the regular expression patterns and the fix_kv function are not accurately transforming JavaScript code to JSON. This can be due to incorrect capturing of specific JavaScript code patterns and inaccurate transformation logic.

To fix the bug, we should revise the regular expression patterns to accurately capture JavaScript code patterns and then modify the logic in the fix_kv function to transform the captured patterns into valid JSON.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
            return v
        elif v.startswith('/*') or v.startswith('//') or v == ',':
            return ""

        if v[0] in ("'", '"'):
            v = re.sub(r'(?s)\\.|"', lambda m: {
                '"': '\\"',
                "\\'": "'",
                '\\\n': '',
                '\\x': '\\u00',
            }.get(m.group(0), m.group(0)), v[1:-1])

        return '"%s"' % v

    return re.sub(r'"(.*?)"|\btrue\b|\bfalse\b|\bnull\b|/\*(.|\n)*?\*/|//.*?\n|(-)?\b[0-9]+\b|\b[0-9]+\b', fix_kv, code)
```

In this corrected code, the regular expression pattern has been simplified to accurately capture JavaScript code patterns, and the fix_kv function has been modified to transform the captured patterns into valid JSON.
