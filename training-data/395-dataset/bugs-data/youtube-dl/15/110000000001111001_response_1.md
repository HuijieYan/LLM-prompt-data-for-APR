The buggy function `js_to_json` is intended to convert JavaScript code to a JSON-like format. However, the implementation is flawed due to issues in the regular expressions used inside the function. The regular expressions are intended to match and replace various patterns in the JavaScript code, but they are not functioning correctly.

The issue occurs within the `fix_kv` function, where certain values are processed incorrectly, leading to unexpected outputs. Additionally, the use of regular expressions is complex and error-prone.

To fix the buggy function, it is recommended to simplify the regular expressions and the overall implementation. The replacement patterns should be carefully handled to ensure the correct translation of JavaScript code to JSON-like format. Additionally, the handling of different data types (e.g., strings, integers, booleans) needs to be improved for accurate conversion.

Here's the corrected code for the `js_to_json` function:

```python
import re
import json

def js_to_json(code):
    # Replace double quotes with single quotes
    code = code.replace('"', "'")
    # Replace single quotes within the text with double quotes
    code = re.sub(r"'([^']*)'", r'"\1"', code)
    # Replace keys without quotes with double quotes
    code = re.sub(r'([{,])(\s*)([a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*)(\s*):', r'\1\2"\3"\4:', code)
    # Replace double quotes around values with single quotes
    code = re.sub(r'(:\s*)"([^"]*)"', r'\1\'\2\'', code)

    return json.loads(code)

# Test cases
code1 = "{\n            'clip':{'provider':'pseudo'}\n        }"
code2 = "{\n            'playlist':[{'controls':{'all':null}}]\n        }"
code3 = "'The CW\\\'s \\\'Crazy Ex-Girlfriend\\\' '"
code4 = "'SAND Number: SAND 2013-7800P\\nPresenter: Tom Russo\\nHabanero Software Training - Xyce Software\\nXyce, Sandia\\u0027s'"
code5 = "{\n            0:{src:'skipped', type: 'application/dash+xml'},\n            1:{src:'skipped', type: 'application/vnd.apple.mpegURL'},\n        }"
code6 = "{'foo':101}"
code7 = "{'duration': '00:01:07'}"
code8 = "{segments: [{'offset':-3.885780586188048e-16,'duration':39.75000000000001}]}"

print(js_to_json(code1))
print(js_to_json(code2))
print(js_to_json(code3))
print(js_to_json(code4))
print(js_to_json(code5))
print(js_to_json(code6))
print(js_to_json(code7))
print(js_to_json(code8))
```

In the corrected code, the JavaScript-like code is manipulated to match the JSON format. This manipulation involves replacing single quotes with double quotes, adding double quotes around keys, and handling various data types before loading the modified code using the `json.loads` function.
