The error is likely caused by the unescapeHTML function not properly handling the input parameters.

The expected output is not being returned for the input parameters '&a&quot;'. The issue seems to be with handling the HTML entities in the input string.

To fix the bug, the unescapeHTML function needs to properly handle HTML entities in the input string. This can be achieved by using Python's html.unescape() function to replace HTML entities with their corresponding characters.

Here's the corrected code for the unescapeHTML function:

```python
import html

def unescapeHTML(s):
    if s is None:
        return None

    return html.unescape(s)
```

By using the html.unescape() function, the function will properly handle HTML entities and return the expected output for the provided test cases.
