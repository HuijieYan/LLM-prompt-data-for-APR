The bug in the `unescapeHTML` function is that it is using the `re.sub` method without importing the `re` module. This will result in a `NameError` when trying to use `re.sub`.

To fix the bug, the `re` module needs to be imported at the beginning of the file where the function is defined.

Here's the corrected code for the `unescapeHTML` function:

```python
import re  # Add this import statement at the beginning of the file

# relative function's signature in this file
def _htmlentity_transform(entity_with_semicolon):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# this is the fixed function
def unescapeHTML(s):
    if s is None:
        return None
    assert type(s) == compat_str

    return re.sub(
        r'&([^;]+;)', lambda m: _htmlentity_transform(m.group(1)), s)
```
