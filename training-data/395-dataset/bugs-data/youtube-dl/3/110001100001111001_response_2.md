Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to be with the regular expression in the `unescapeHTML` function. It's trying to match HTML entities with the regex pattern `r'&([^;]+;)'` and replacing them using a lambda function that calls `_htmlentity_transform`.

Reason for the Bug:
The issue is that the regex pattern is not matching all types of HTML entities, leading to incomplete replacements.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the regex pattern in the re.sub() function to match all types of HTML entities.
2. Ensure that the lambda function or _htmlentity_transform function can handle all types of HTML entities and provide the correct replacement value.

Corrected Code:
```python
import html

def unescapeHTML(s):
    if s is None:
        return None
    
    return html.unescape(s)
```
