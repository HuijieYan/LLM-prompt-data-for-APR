The potential error in the provided `unescapeHTML` function is that it uses the variable `compat_str` which is not defined anywhere in the code. This could result in a NameError. Additionally, the `re` module has not been imported in the code, so using `re.sub` will result in an AttributeError.

To fix the bug, we can import the `re` module and define the `compat_str` variable. We can also use HTMLParser to unescape the HTML entities in the input string. Here's the corrected function:

```python
import html

def unescapeHTML(s):
    if s is None:
        return None

    return html.unescape(s)
```
