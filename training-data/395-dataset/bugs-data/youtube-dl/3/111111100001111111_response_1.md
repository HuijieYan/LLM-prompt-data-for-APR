The bug in the `unescapeHTML` function is that it is missing an import statement for the `re` module. This is causing the `re.sub` function to fail when trying to substitute the HTML entities in the input string.

To fix this bug, we need to import the `re` module at the beginning of the file `utils.py`. Additionally, we need to modify the `unescapeHTML` function to utilize the `_htmlentity_transform` function properly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re  # Add this import statement at the beginning of the file

# relative function's signature in this file
def _htmlentity_transform(entity_with_semicolon):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# this is the corrected function
def unescapeHTML(s):
    if s is None:
        return None
    
    # Modified lambda function to properly utilize _htmlentity_transform
    return re.sub(
        r'&([^;]+;)', lambda m: _htmlentity_transform(m.group(0)), s)
```

With these changes, the `unescapeHTML` function should now be able to correctly unescape HTML entities in the input string.
