The potential error in the problematic function is that the `_htmlentity_transform` function is not defined or implemented. This will cause an error when trying to call the `unescapeHTML` function.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `_htmlentity_transform` function is missing or not provided in the given code.

To fix the bug, we need to define the `_htmlentity_transform` function and then call it within the `unescapeHTML` function. We can use the `html` module to handle HTML entities.

Here's the corrected code for the `unescapeHTML` function:

```python
import html
import re

def unescapeHTML(s):
    if s is None:
        return None
    assert type(s) == str

    return re.sub(
        r'&([^;]+;)', lambda m: html.unescape(m.group(0)), s)
```

In this corrected code, we use Python's built-in `html` module to unescape HTML entities. The `html.unescape` function handles both named and numerical HTML entities, removing the need for the `_htmlentity_transform` function. This should fix the bug and make the `unescapeHTML` function work correctly.
