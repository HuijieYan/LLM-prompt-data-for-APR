Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the unescapeHTML function as it is not returning the expected outputs for several test cases.

Reason behind the bug:
The _htmlentity_transform function is not being called properly within the re.sub function in the unescapeHTML function. This is causing the incorrect transformation of HTML entities.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Call the _htmlentity_transform function properly within the lambda function inside re.sub.
2. Check if the _htmlentity_transform function is working correctly for transforming the HTML entities.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import re

def _htmlentity_transform(entity_with_semicolon):
    # ...code to transform HTML entities...

def unescapeHTML(s):
    if s is None:
        return None
    assert type(s) == str
    
    return re.sub(
        r'&([^;]+;)', lambda m: _htmlentity_transform(m.group(0)), s)
```
