The bug in the provided function `unescapeHTML` is that it references `compat_str` without being defined in the given code snippet. This may cause an error as `compat_str` is not recognized.

To fix this issue, we can define `compat_str` as a string at the beginning of the function:

```python
import re

def unescapeHTML(s):
    if s is None:
        return None
    compat_str = str(s)

    return re.sub(r'&([^;]+;)', lambda m: _htmlentity_transform(m.group(1)), s)
```

This fix ensures that the error related to `compat_str` is resolved and the function should be able to handle the provided input parameters without any issues.
