The issue is caused by the use of the lambda function in the re.sub method. It is not able to handle all the cases of HTML entities properly, leading to the incorrect results in some test cases.

To fix this issue, we can replace the lambda function with a function that calls the _htmlentity_transform function to handle the HTML entities. This will ensure that all cases of HTML entities are correctly transformed.

Here's the corrected code for the unescapeHTML function:

```python
import re

# relative function's signature in this file
def _htmlentity_transform(entity_with_semicolon):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# corrected function
def unescapeHTML(s):
    if s is None:
        return None
    assert type(s) == compat_str
    
    def replace_entity(m):
        return _htmlentity_transform(m.group(1))
    
    return re.sub(r'&([^;]+;)', replace_entity, s)
```
