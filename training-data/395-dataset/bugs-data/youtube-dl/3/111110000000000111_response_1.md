The buggy function `unescapeHTML` is trying to unescape HTML characters, but it contains some issues. 

The potential error location within the function is the line `assert type(s) == compat_str`. The function is trying to check if the input `s` is of type `compat_str`, but the `compat_str` type is not defined in the given code.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the `compat_str` type is not defined, which causes the function to fail when checking the type of `s`.

To fix the bug, we can remove the check for the type of `s` and directly call the `re.sub` function with the regular expression and the transformation function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def unescapeHTML(s):
    if s is None:
        return None

    return re.sub(r'&([^;]+;)', lambda m: _htmlentity_transform(m.group(1)), s)
```
