Potential Error:
The potential error in the provided function is that the `re` module has not been imported, so the `re.sub` function cannot be used.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `re` module is missing and has not been imported in the function. This results in a "NameError" when trying to use the `re.sub` function.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
Import the `re` module at the beginning of the function in order to use the `re.sub` function.

Corrected Code:
```python
import re

def unescapeHTML(s):
    if s is None:
        return None
    assert type(s) == compat_str

    return re.sub(
        r'&([^;]+;)', lambda m: _htmlentity_transform(m.group(1)), s)
```
