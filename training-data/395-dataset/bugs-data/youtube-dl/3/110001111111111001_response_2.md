The error occurs on the test case `self.assertEqual(unescapeHTML('&a&quot;'), '&a"')`. The function should replace the HTML entities with their corresponding characters.

The bug is likely to be located in the `unescapeHTML` function, specifically in the `re.sub` call. The lambda function `_htmlentity_transform` is not correctly handling the conversion of HTML entities to their corresponding characters.

The reason behind the bug is that the lambda function `_htmlentity_transform` is not correctly parsing and transforming the HTML entities to characters. This is causing the incorrect outputs in some test cases.

To fix the bug, the lambda function `_htmlentity_transform` needs to be modified to correctly transform HTML entities to characters. This can be done using a dictionary lookup for common HTML entities.

Here's the corrected code for the `unescapeHTML` function:

```python
import re

HTML_ENTITIES = {
    "quot": '"',
    "amp": "&",
    "apos": "'",
    "lt": "<",
    "gt": ">",
    "nbsp": " ",
    "amp": "&",
    "mdash": "â€”",
    # Add more HTML entities as needed
}

def _htmlentity_transform(entity_with_semicolon):
    entity = entity_with_semicolon[:-1]  # Remove the semicolon
    if entity.startswith("#x"):
        return chr(int(entity[2:], 16))
    elif entity.startswith("#"):
        return chr(int(entity[1:]))
    elif entity in HTML_ENTITIES:
        return HTML_ENTITIES[entity]
    else:
        return entity_with_semicolon  # Return original entity if not found

def unescapeHTML(s):
    if s is None:
        return None
    assert type(s) == str
    
    return re.sub(
        r'&([^;]+;)', lambda m: _htmlentity_transform(m.group(1)), s)
```

With this corrected code, the `unescapeHTML` function should now correctly handle and transform HTML entities to their corresponding characters. The test case `self.assertEqual(unescapeHTML('&a&quot;'), '&a"')` should now pass without errors.
