Potential error location: The `compat_str` type is not defined. Also, the `_htmlentity_transform` function is not defined within the buggy function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `compat_str` type is not a built-in Python type, and the `_htmlentity_transform` function is not defined within the buggy function. These issues will cause the function to throw errors when executed.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define the `compat_str` type if it is a custom type in the codebase. If it is not a custom type, remove the assertion checking it.
2. Define the `_htmlentity_transform` function or import it from the relevant module.
3. Import the `re` module since `re.sub` is being used in the function.

```python
# Corrected function
import re

def unescapeHTML(s):
    if s is None:
        return None

    return re.sub(
        r'&([^;]+;)', lambda m: _htmlentity_transform(m.group(1)), s)
```
Note: This assumes that the `_htmlentity_transform` function is defined or imported from the relevant module elsewhere in the codebase. If it is not, it will need to be defined for the function to work properly.
