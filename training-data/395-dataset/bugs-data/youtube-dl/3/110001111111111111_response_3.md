The error in the function is occurring because the `unescapeHTML` function is not correctly replacing the HTML entities with their corresponding characters.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the regular expression replacement using `re.sub` and the lambda function. This is where the replacement of HTML entities with their characters is being done.

The bug is occurring because the lambda function used in the `re.sub` call is not correctly transforming the HTML entities into their corresponding characters.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `unescapeHTML` function to correctly transform the HTML entities into their corresponding characters using the `_htmlentity_transform` function. 

Here's the corrected code for the `unescapeHTML` function:

```python
import re

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/youtube-dl_3/youtube_dl/utils.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def _htmlentity_transform(entity_with_semicolon):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# this is the fixed function
def unescapeHTML(s):
    if s is None:
        return None
    assert type(s) == str

    return re.sub(
        r'&([^;]+);', lambda m: _htmlentity_transform(m.group()), s)
```

With this corrected code, the `unescapeHTML` function will correctly replace the HTML entities with their corresponding characters, as specified in the test cases.
