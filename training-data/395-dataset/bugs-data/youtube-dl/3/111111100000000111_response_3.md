The problem with the function `unescapeHTML` is that it is using the `compat_str` type without importing it and `re` without importing it as well.

The bug occurs because the `compat_str` type and the `re` module are not imported in the file.

To resolve this, we can import the necessary modules and type at the beginning of the file and then use them in the `unescapeHTML` function.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/youtube-dl_3/youtube_dl/utils.py
import re
from .compat import compat_str

# relative function's signature in this file
def _htmlentity_transform(entity_with_semicolon):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# this is the fixed function
def unescapeHTML(s):
    if s is None:
        return None
    assert type(s) == compat_str

    return re.sub(
        r'&([^;]+;)', lambda m: _htmlentity_transform(m.group(1)), s)
```
