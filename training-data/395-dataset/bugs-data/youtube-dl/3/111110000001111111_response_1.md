The buggy function `unescapeHTML` is trying to unescape HTML entities in a string. It's using the `_htmlentity_transform` function, which is not defined in the code provided. Additionally, the `re` module is not imported. 

To fix this, we need to import the `re` module and define the `_htmlentity_transform` function. Without knowing the exact implementation of the `_htmlentity_transform` function, I will assume it performs the actual transformation of HTML entities.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re

# Define _htmlentity_transform function (implementation depends on requirements)
def _htmlentity_transform(entity):
    # implementation of entity transformation
    pass

def unescapeHTML(s):
    if s is None:
        return None
    # assert type(s) == compat_str  (commenting out this line since compat_str is not defined)

    return re.sub(
        r'&([^;]+;)', lambda m: _htmlentity_transform(m.group(1)), s)
```

Without the definition of `compat_str`, it's unclear what that line was trying to accomplish, so it's commented out.

This corrected code will address the missing import of the `re` module and provide a placeholder for the `_htmlentity_transform` function, assuming it performs the necessary entity transformation.
