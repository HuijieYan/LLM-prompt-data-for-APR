The error message indicates that the requested format is not available, leading to an ExtractorError being raised. This suggests that the build_format_selector function is not processing the requested format correctly.

The potential error location is likely within the _parse_format_selection function, particularly in the logic that handles the requested format and selects the appropriate formats to download.

The reason behind the bug may be incorrect handling of the requested format specifier, leading to the selection of unavailable formats or a failure to identify and process the requested format correctly.

To fix the bug, the _parse_format_selection function needs to be thoroughly reviewed and potentially refactored to ensure that it correctly handles the requested format specifier and selects the appropriate formats to download. Additionally, the logic for format selection and processing should be carefully validated and tested to ensure correct behavior.

Corrected code for the build_format_selector function:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # Existing code

    def _parse_format_selection(tokens, endwith=[]):
        # Existing code for parsing format selection

        def final_selector(formats):
            for _filter in filters:
                formats = list(filter(_filter, formats))
            result = [f for f in selector_function(formats)]
            if not result:
                raise ExtractorError('requested format not available', expected=True)
            return result
        return final_selector

    # Existing code

    return _build_selector_function(parsed_selector)
```
