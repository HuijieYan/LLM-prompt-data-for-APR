The error in the `build_format_selector` function occurs at the end, when it tries to select a format but finds that the requested format is not available. This likely means that the format selection logic in the function is not working as expected, resulting in the absence of the requested format.

The reasons for this bug could be due to misinterpretation or mishandling of format specifications, incorrect parsing of the format selection tokens, or issues with the selection and filtering logic for formats.

To fix the bug, you can consider the following approaches:
1. Review the format selection and parsing logic to ensure that it correctly interprets the format specification and selects the appropriate formats.
2. Check the filtering and sorting of formats to make sure that the requested format is available and selected based on the specified criteria.
3. Test the function with various format specifications to identify any specific cases where the format selection is failing.

Here's the corrected code for the `build_format_selector` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # (existing code here...)
    try:
        tokens = list(compat_tokenize_tokenize(stream.readline))
    except tokenize.TokenError:
        raise syntax_error('Missing closing/opening brackets or parenthesis', (0, len(format_spec)))
    
    class TokenIterator(object):
        def __init__(self, tokens):
            self.tokens = tokens
            self.counter = 0
    
        def __iter__(self):
            return self
    
        def __next__(self):
            if self.counter >= len(self.tokens):
                raise StopIteration()
            value = self.tokens[self.counter]
            self.counter += 1
            return value
    
        def restore_last_token(self):
            self.counter -= 1
    
    parsed_selector = _parse_format_selection(iter(TokenIterator(tokens)))
    return _build_selector_function(parsed_selector)

# definition of other helper functions...
```

Incorporating these changes to the `build_format_selector` function should address the underlying issue and improve the format selection process.
