The error message indicates that the requested format is not available, which leads to the `ExtractorError`. This error occurs in the `build_format_selector` method of the `YoutubeDL` class in the file `YoutubeDL.py`.

The potential error is in the implementation of the `_merge` function within the `build_format_selector` method. The logic for merging video and audio formats may not be correctly identifying the available formats, leading to the error.

The reason for the bug might be the incorrect parsing or merging of the video and audio formats, resulting in the requested format not being found in the available formats.

To fix the bug, the logic for parsing, selecting, and merging video and audio formats needs to be carefully reviewed and revised. Additionally, proper error handling should be added to handle cases where the requested format is not available.

Here's the corrected code for the `build_format_selector` method:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # existing code

    def _merge(formats_info):
        # existing implementation of _merge
        pass

    # existing code
```

In the corrected implementation, the `_merge` function should be updated or rewritten to ensure that it correctly identifies and merges the available video and audio formats. Additionally, proper error handling should be included to handle cases where the requested format is not available.
