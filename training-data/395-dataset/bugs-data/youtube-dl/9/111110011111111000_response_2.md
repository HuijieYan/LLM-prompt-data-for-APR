    """
    YoutubeDL class.
    
    YoutubeDL objects are the ones responsible of downloading the
    actual video file and writing it to disk if the user has requested
    it, among some other tasks. In most cases there should be one per
    program. As, given a video URL, the downloader doesn't know how to
    extract all the needed information, task that InfoExtractors do, it
    has to pass the URL to one of them.
    
    For this, YoutubeDL objects have a method that allows
    InfoExtractors to be registered in a given order. When it is passed
    a URL, the YoutubeDL object handles it to the first InfoExtractor it
    finds that reports being able to handle it. The InfoExtractor extracts
    all the information about the video or videos the URL refers to, and
    YoutubeDL process the extracted information, possibly using a File
    Downloader to download the video.
    
    YoutubeDL objects accept a lot of parameters. In order not to saturate
    the object constructor with arguments, it receives a dictionary of
    options instead. These options are available through the params
    attribute for the InfoExtractors to use. The YoutubeDL also
    registers itself as the downloader in charge for the InfoExtractors
    that are added to it, so this is a "mutual registration".
    
    Available options:
    
    username:          Username for authentication purposes.
    password:          Password for authentication purposes.
    videopassword:     Password for accessing a video.
