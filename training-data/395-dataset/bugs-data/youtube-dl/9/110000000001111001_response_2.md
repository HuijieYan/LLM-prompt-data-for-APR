The error "TokenError: EOF in multi-line statement" suggests that there is an issue with tokenization in the _parse_format_selection function. This may be caused by an incorrect representation of the input format_spec.

Upon inspection of the code, it appears that the input format_spec needs to be tokenized using Python's tokenize module. However, the function is currently trying to tokenize the string representation of the format_spec directly, which is causing the TokenError.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the tokenization process to correctly handle the format_spec input. Additionally, we should ensure that the tokens are correctly processed within the _parse_format_selection and _parse_filter functions.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import collections
import io
import tokenize
import itertools

def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    def syntax_error(note, start):
        message = (
            'Invalid format specification: '
            '{0}\n\t{1}\n\t{2}^'.format(note, format_spec, ' ' * start[1]))
        return SyntaxError(message)

    PICKFIRST = 'PICKFIRST'
    MERGE = 'MERGE'
    SINGLE = 'SINGLE'
    GROUP = 'GROUP'
    FormatSelector = collections.namedtuple('FormatSelector', ['type', 'selector', 'filters'])

    def _parse_filter(tokens):
        filter_parts = []
        for token in tokens:
            type, string, start, _, _ = token
            if type == tokenize.OP and string == ']':
                return ''.join(filter_parts)
            else:
                filter_parts.append(string)

    def _parse_format_selection(tokens, endwith=[]):
        selectors = []
        current_selector = None
        for token in tokens:
            type, string, start, _, _ = token
            # ENCODING is only defined in python 3.x
            if type == getattr(tokenize, 'ENCODING', None):
                continue
            elif type in [tokenize.NAME, tokenize.NUMBER]:
                current_selector = FormatSelector(SINGLE, string, [])
            elif type == tokenize.OP:
                if string in endwith:
                    break
                # ... rest of the code remains the same

    # ... rest of the code remains the same
```
In this corrected code, I have modified the _parse_filter and _parse_format_selection functions to correctly process the tokens. I have also updated the way tokens are iterated over to ensure correct processing.

This should fix the tokenization issue and resolve the TokenError.
