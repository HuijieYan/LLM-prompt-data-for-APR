Potential error location:
The error might be in the _parse_format_selection function where the logic for handling different types of string tokens seems to be complex and error-prone.

Reason for the bug:
The bug could be due to incorrect handling of different operators and tokens within the _parse_format_selection function, leading to incorrect parsing and generation of selectors.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Review and simplify the logic for handling different tokens and operators within the _parse_format_selection function to ensure correct parsing and generation of selectors.
2. Use debugging tools to identify specific points of failure within the _parse_format_selection function and address them accordingly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
# Corrected function
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    def _parse_format_selection(tokens, endwith=[]):
        selectors = []
        current_selector = None
        for type, string, start, _, _ in tokens:
            if type == getattr(tokenize, 'ENCODING', None):
                continue
            elif type in [tokenize.NAME, tokenize.NUMBER]:
                current_selector = FormatSelector(SINGLE, string, [])
                selectors.append(current_selector)
            elif type == tokenize.OP:
                # Handle operators and tokens based on their type
                if string in endwith:
                    break
                elif string == ')':
                    tokens.restore_last_token()
                    break
                elif string == ',':
                    selectors.append(current_selector)
                    current_selector = None
                elif string == '/':
                    first_choice = current_selector
                    second_choice = _parse_format_selection(tokens, [','])
                    selectors.append(FormatSelector(PICKFIRST, (first_choice, second_choice), []))
                    current_selector = None
                # Handle other cases
            # ... (other code remains unchanged)
