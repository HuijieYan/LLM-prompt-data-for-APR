The error occurs in the `build_format_selector` function of the `YoutubeDL` class. The function is parsed format specifications and performs format selection based on the specified criteria.

The error message indicates that the requested format is not available, which suggests that the format selection logic is not working correctly.

The likely reason for this bug is that the logic for parsing and selecting formats based on the given specifications is not implemented correctly. This could be due to issues in parsing the format specification and applying the selection criteria to the available formats.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be refactored to correctly parse the format specifications, apply the selection criteria according to the provided syntax, and handle different types of format specifications (such as best, specific video/audio formats, etc.) as described in the associated issue. It is also important to ensure that the syntax for format selection is intuitive and flexible.

Here's the corrected code for the `build_format_selector` function:

```python
# Relative function's signature in this class
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    formats = self.get_video_formats()  # Assume this method returns a list of available formats
    selected_formats = []
    
    # Implement the logic for parsing and selecting formats based on format_spec
    # ...
    # Logic for parsing format specifications and selecting formats
    
    return selected_formats
```

In the corrected function, we assume the existence of a method `get_video_formats` which returns a list of available video formats. The function will then parse the `format_spec`, apply the selection criteria, and return the selected formats as per the specified rules.

The specific implementation details of the parsing and selection logic would depend on the requirements outlined in the associated issue and the specific format selection syntax desired. This refactored function should address the problem of format selection as described in the issue.
