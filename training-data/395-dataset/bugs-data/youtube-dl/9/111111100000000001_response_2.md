The error in the given code seems to be a SyntaxError occurring in the `build_format_selector` method. The function attempts to parse a format specification and build a selector function for it. However, it seems to be using some undefined variables, and the overall logic is complex and prone to errors.

The potential error location is within the `_parse_format_selection` function. This function seems to be responsible for parsing the format selection tokens and building the selector function based on that. The error may be due to inconsistencies in handling token types and building the selector function.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug are as follows:
1. The complex token handling and interpretation in the `_parse_format_selection` method can lead to errors in parsing the format specifications.
2. Undefined methods and variables (`tokens.restore_last_token()`) are being used in the function, which can lead to errors.

To fix the bug, it is suggested to simplify the token parsing and selector function building logic. Additionally, ensure that all methods and variables used within the function are properly defined and utilized.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import collections
import itertools
import tokenize
import io
import itertools
import youtube_dl
from .compat import compat_tokenize_tokenize

class YoutubeDL(youtube_dl.YoutubeDL):
    # ... (other methods)

    def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
        def _parse_format_selection(tokens, endwith=[]):
            # ... (existing implementation remains unchanged)
            pass

        def _build_selector_function(selector):
            # ... (existing implementation remains unchanged)
            pass

        stream = io.BytesIO(format_spec.encode('utf-8'))
        try:
            tokens = list(compat_tokenize_tokenize(stream.readline))
        except tokenize.TokenError:
            message = 'Missing closing/opening brackets or parenthesis'
            raise SyntaxError(message)

        class TokenIterator(object):
            def __init__(self, tokens):
                self.tokens = tokens
                self.counter = 0

            def __iter__(self):
                return self

            def __next__(self):
                if self.counter >= len(self.tokens):
                    raise StopIteration()
                value = self.tokens[self.counter]
                self.counter += 1
                return value

            next = __next__

            def restore_last_token(self):
                self.counter -= 1

        parsed_selector = _parse_format_selection(iter(TokenIterator(tokens)))
        return _build_selector_function(parsed_selector)
```

In the corrected code:
1. The `compat` module is imported and utilized for tokenization.
2. The token parsing logic is kept intact, but the `TokenIterator` is defined with the necessary methods to handle token iteration and `restore_last_token` functionality.
3. The potential SyntaxError regarding missing brackets or parenthesis is explicitly raised when a TokenError occurs.

The corrected code aims to simplify the token parsing process and address potential inconsistencies with token handling.
