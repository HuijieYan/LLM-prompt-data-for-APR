The potential error in the `build_format_selector` function is that the `TokenIterator` does not restore the last token correctly.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `TokenIterator` does not correctly handle the restoration of the last token. This can cause incorrect behavior when iterating over the tokens during parsing.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `TokenIterator` class to correctly restore the last token.

Here's the corrected code for the `build_format_selector` function:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # ... (other code remains the same) ...

    class TokenIterator(object):
        def __init__(self, tokens):
            self.tokens = tokens
            self.counter = 0
            self.last_token = None  # Added for storing the last token

        def __iter__(self):
            return self

        def __next__(self):
            if self.counter >= len(self.tokens):
                raise StopIteration()
            value = self.tokens[self.counter]
            self.last_token = value  # Store the last token
            self.counter += 1
            return value

        next = __next__

        def restore_last_token(self):
            # Decrement the counter to move back one position
            if self.counter > 0:
                self.counter -= 1
                self.last_token = None  # Reset the last token

    # ... (other code remains the same) ...
```

In the corrected code, we have added a `last_token` attribute to store the last token encountered. Additionally, we modified the `restore_last_token` method to properly decrement the counter and reset the last token.

This correction ensures that the `TokenIterator` correctly handles the restoration of the last token.
