The test case "self.assertEqual(unified_strdate('UNKNOWN DATE FORMAT'), None)" indicates that the function returns the string "None" instead of the value None. This is likely due to the return statement within the function where "None" is returned as a string, instead of the None value.

The buggy function is the unified_strdate function, and the error is likely occurring when the function returns the upload_date as a string instead of None.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the return statement to return the actual None value instead of the string "None". This can be achieved by removing the quotes around the word "None" in the return statement.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def unified_strdate(date_str, day_first=True):
    """Return a string with the date in the format YYYYMMDD"""

    if date_str is None:
        return None
    upload_date = None
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)
    if upload_date is None:
        timetuple = email.utils.parsedate_tz(date_str)
        if timetuple:
            upload_date = datetime.datetime(*timetuple[:6]).strftime('%Y%m%d')
    return upload_date
```

By making this change, the function will now return the actual None value when the "upload_date" variable is None, resolving the issue with the test case.
