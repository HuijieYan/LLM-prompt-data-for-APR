The potential error in the provided function is the parsing of the date string. The function attempts to parse the date string using multiple date format expressions, and if none of them match, it falls back to parsing with email.utils.parsedate_tz. However, the parsing logic is not correctly implemented, which may result in incorrect date parsing or None being returned.

The reason behind the bug occurrence is the absence of a proper date parsing strategy. The function lacks a robust error handling mechanism to deal with different date formats and date parsing exceptions. Additionally, the upload_date variable is initialized as None and is not used correctly to store the parsed date.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to use a more robust and comprehensive date parsing strategy using the dateutil.parser module, which can automatically parse various date formats. This module can handle date strings in different formats and eliminate the need for manually defining multiple date format expressions. Additionally, proper error handling should be implemented to handle date parsing exceptions.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function using the dateutil.parser module:

```python
import dateutil.parser

def unified_strdate(date_str, day_first=True):
    """Return a string with the date in the format YYYYMMDD"""

    if date_str is None:
        return None
    
    try:
        upload_date = dateutil.parser.parse(date_str).strftime('%Y%m%d')
    except ValueError:
        upload_date = None
    
    return str(upload_date)
```
