The error occurs in the function `unified_strdate` in the file `utils.py` of the youtube-dl repository. The error message indicates a ValueError, which suggests that the date parsing in the function is not working correctly since the time data 'None' does not match the expected format '%Y%m%d'.

The potential error location within the function is the date parsing and formatting part. The function tries to match the input `date_str` with a list of date format expressions using `datetime.datetime.strptime`, and then formats the result as '%Y%m%d'.

The bug occurs when the `upload_date` is set to `None` and then returned as a string using `compat_str(upload_date)`. This results in a TypeError in the calling code since it expects a non-None value.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to handle the case when `upload_date` is None and avoid returning it directly. Instead, the function should return None explicitly if `upload_date` is None.

Here's the corrected code for the `unified_strdate` function:

```python
import re
import datetime
import email.utils

def unified_strdate(date_str, day_first=True):
    if date_str is None:
        return None
    upload_date = None
    # <...> (same as in the original function)
    # <...>
    for expression in format_expressions:
        try:
            upload_date = datetime.datetime.strptime(date_str, expression).strftime('%Y%m%d')
            break  # Exit the loop when a valid date format is found
        except ValueError:
            pass
    if upload_date is None:
        timetuple = email.utils.parsedate_tz(date_str)
        if timetuple:
            upload_date = datetime.datetime(*timetuple[:6]).strftime('%Y%m%d')
    if upload_date is None:
        return None  # Explicitly return None if upload_date is None
    return compat_str(upload_date)
```

This corrected code includes breaking the loop when a valid date format is found, as well as explicitly returning None if `upload_date` is still None after all attempts.
