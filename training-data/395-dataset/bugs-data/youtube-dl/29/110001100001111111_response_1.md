The error seems to be occurring because the function `unified_strdate` is unable to handle the date formats provided and is returning a `None` value, which does not match the expected format `'%Y%m%d'`.

The bug appears to be in the section where the date formats are being checked and processed. The function iterates through a list of format expressions and attempts to parse the date string using each format. If the current format does not match, it moves on to the next one until either a match is found or all formats have been tried. However, the logic does not handle the case where none of the formats match, leading to the `None` value being returned.

To fix this bug, the function should be updated to properly handle the case where none of the date formats match. It should return a default value or raise an error if the date string cannot be parsed using any of the provided formats.

Here's the corrected code for the `unified_strdate` function:

```python
import re
import datetime
import email.utils

def unified_strdate(date_str, day_first=True):
    if date_str is None:
        return None
    
    upload_date = None
    date_str = date_str.replace(',', ' ')
    
    format_expressions = [
        # List of date format expressions
    ]

    if day_first:
        format_expressions.extend([
            # Additional date format expressions for day first
        ])
    else:
        format_expressions.extend([
            # Additional date format expressions for month first
        ])

    for expression in format_expressions:
        try:
            upload_date = datetime.datetime.strptime(date_str, expression).strftime('%Y%m%d')
            break  # Stop iterating if a match is found
        except ValueError:
            continue  # Continue to the next format expression if no match
    if upload_date is None:
        raise ValueError("Unable to parse date string using any of the provided formats")
    return str(upload_date)
```

This updated code introduces a break statement to stop the iteration when a match is found. It also includes a handle for the case where none of the formats match, raising a ValueError if the date string cannot be parsed.
