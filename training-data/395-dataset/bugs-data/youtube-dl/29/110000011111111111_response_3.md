Based on the error message from the test function, it seems that the `unified_strdate` function is returning the string `'None'` instead of the `None` object when `date_str` is `'UNKNOWN DATE FORMAT'`.

The bug is likely occurring in the return statement of the `unified_strdate` function. The function is returning the result of the `compat_str(upload_date)` call, which is converting `None` to the string `'None'`.

To fix this bug, I would recommend updating the return statement of the `unified_strdate` function to directly return `upload_date` without converting it to a string using `compat_str`.

Here's the corrected code for the `unified_strdate` function:

```python
def unified_strdate(date_str, day_first=True):
    """Return a string with the date in the format YYYYMMDD"""

    if date_str is None:
        return None
    upload_date = None
    # The rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...

    return upload_date  # Updated return statement
```
