The error message from the test function is AssertionError: 'None' != None, indicating that the function is returning the string 'None' instead of the actual `None` value.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the return statement. The function should return `None` instead of the string 'None'.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is a mismatch in the return type of the function. The function is expected to return `None` if the input `date_str` is None, but it is returning the string 'None' instead.

To fix the bug, the return statement of the function should be changed to return `None` instead of the string 'None'. This will ensure that the function adheres to the expected return type.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def unified_strdate(date_str, day_first=True):
    """Return a string with the date in the format YYYYMMDD"""

    if date_str is None:
        return None
    upload_date = None
    # other code remains unchanged
```
