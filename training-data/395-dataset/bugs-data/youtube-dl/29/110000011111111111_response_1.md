The issue with the `unified_strdate` function is that it returns the string `'None'` instead of the `None` type when the input date format is not recognized. This causes the test case for the input `'UNKNOWN DATE FORMAT'` to fail, as it expects the return value to be `None` but receives the string 'None' instead.

The bug occurs because in the `unified_strdate` function, the line `return compat_str(upload_date)` converts the `upload_date` value to a string using the `compat_str` function, even if it is `None`. This causes the None type to be converted to the string 'None'.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `unified_strdate` function returns `None` as a type and not a string when the date format is not recognized.

Here's the corrected code for the `unified_strdate` function:

```python
def unified_strdate(date_str, day_first=True):
    """Return a string with the date in the format YYYYMMDD"""

    if date_str is None:
        return None
    upload_date = None
    # ... (other existing code remains unchanged)

    # existing code for date validation...

    if upload_date is None:
        timetuple = email.utils.parsedate_tz(date_str)
        if timetuple:
            upload_date = datetime.datetime(*timetuple[:6]).strftime('%Y%m%d')

    return upload_date  # Return None if upload_date is None, otherwise return the formatted date
```

With this change, the `unified_strdate` function will return `None` as a type when the date format is not recognized, and the test case for the input `'UNKNOWN DATE FORMAT'` would pass.
