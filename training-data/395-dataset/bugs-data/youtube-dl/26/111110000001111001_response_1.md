The buggy function `js_to_json` is intended to convert JavaScript code to JSON. However, the function is not functioning as intended due to a combination of regular expression issues and problematic logic.

The main issue lies in the `fix_kv` function, which is intended to handle the replacement of key-value pairs in the JavaScript code. This function is currently not functioning correctly due to the regular expressions and conditional logic within it.

One approach to fixing the bug is to simplify the implementation of the `fix_kv` function. Instead of using complex regular expressions and conditional logic, a simpler approach using Python's `json` module can be employed to directly convert the JavaScript code to JSON. This can be achieved by removing the `fix_kv` function and using `json.loads` to directly convert the JavaScript code to JSON.

Here's the corrected code for the `js_to_json` function using the `json` module:

```python
import json

def js_to_json(code):
    # Clean up single quotes and line continuation slashes
    code = code.replace("'", '"').replace('\\\n', '')

    # Use json.loads to directly convert the JavaScript code to JSON
    return json.loads(code)
```
