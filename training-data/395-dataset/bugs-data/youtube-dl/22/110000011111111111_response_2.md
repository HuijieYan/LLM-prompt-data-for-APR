The bug is likely occurring in the `_match_one` function. This function is responsible for parsing and applying matching filters to dictionary entries based on specified criteria. The error message "Invalid filter part" indicates that the parsing of the filter parts is failing in the function.

The error occurs when `filter_part` is a string in the form "uploader = "John Sucks at Video Games"" and the function is unable to correctly parse this input.

To fix this bug, the parsing of the filter parts in the `_match_one` function needs to be corrected. It seems that the function is not handling the filter parts with spaces and special characters correctly. Additionally, the logic for parsing and applying the filters needs to be improved to handle different types of comparison values, such as strings with whitespace and special characters.

Here's the corrected code for the `_match_one` function with the necessary modifications:

```python
def _match_one(filter_part, dct):
    ...
    # Existing code

    # Improved parsing logic
    match = re.match(r'(?P<key>[a-z_]+)\s*=\s*(?P<quote>["\'])(?P<value>.*?)\2', filter_part)
    if match:
        key = match.group('key')
        value = match.group('value')
        actual_value = dct.get(key)
        if actual_value is not None:
            if actual_value != value:
                return False
            else:
                return True
        return False

    # Existing code

    raise ValueError('Invalid filter part %r' % filter_part)
```

In this corrected code, the filter_part is parsed to extract the key and value from the input string. The key and value are then used to compare and match the corresponding values in the dictionary `dct`. If a match is found, the function returns True.

This modification should address the parsing and matching issues with filter parts containing spaces and special characters.
