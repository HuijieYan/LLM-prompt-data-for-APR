The error appears to be related to the parsing of the "--match-filter" parameter, which is used to filter videos based on certain criteria such as uploader or uploader_ID.

It seems that the function is trying to parse the filter_part and apply comparison operators based on the provided criteria. The error message "Invalid filter part" suggests that there is an issue with the parsing and comparison logic.

The potential error location within the code could be in the parsing and comparison logic, specifically in the _match_one function.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the parsing logic correctly identifies the comparison operator and the comparison value (whether it's a string or integer) and then applies the appropriate comparison operation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re
import operator

def _match_one(filter_part, dct):
    COMPARISON_OPERATORS = {
        '<': operator.lt,
        '<=': operator.le,
        '>': operator.gt,
        '>=': operator.ge,
        '=': operator.eq,
        '!=': operator.ne,
    }
    m = re.match(r'\s*(?P<key>[a-z_]+)\s*(?P<op>[<>=!]+)\s*(?P<value>.+)\s*', filter_part)
    if m:
        op = COMPARISON_OPERATORS[m.group('op')]
        actual_value = dct.get(m.group('key'))
        comparison_value = m.group('value')

        if isinstance(actual_value, str):
            comparison_value = str(comparison_value)

        return op(actual_value, comparison_value)

    raise ValueError('Invalid filter part %r' % filter_part)
```

In the corrected code, we simplified the parsing logic using a regular expression to extract the key, comparison operator, and comparison value. We then convert the comparison value to a string if the actual value is a string. Finally, we apply the comparison operation and return the result.
