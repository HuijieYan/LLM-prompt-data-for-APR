How do I use --match-filter to match this youtube channel?
Does it support spaces or hyphens in the string?

This is the uploader and uploader_ID from the json dump for one of the videos.

   "uploader":"John Sucks at Video Games",
   "uploader_id":"UC1hlBVlxLDY--Ih2fEyH5nQ",
For uploader, it will either not match spaces properly (breaking them into separate tokens) or just not match.

ValueError: Invalid filter part u'uploader_id = UC1hlBVlxLDY--Ih2fEyH5nQ'
I know I can specify the channel in the video URL, but I want to use my subscription list and pick the video format depending on the channel. I don't want to unsubscribe from these channels. I need to exclude those channels with the last catch-all download line in the script using match-format "uploader != xxxx & uploader != xxxx & uploader != xxxx "

Here is that part of my script:

youtube-dl -f 299+141/299+140 https://www.youtube.com/user/blkdog7/videos -o "%%(uploader)s/%%(title)s.%%(ext)s" --ignore-errors --download-archive archive.YT --verbose --restrict-filenames 
youtube-dl -f 299+141/299+140 https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC1hlBVlxLDY--Ih2fEyH5nQ/videos  -o "%%(uploader)s/%%(title)s.%%(ext)s" --ignore-errors --download-archive archive.YT --verbose --restrict-filenames 
youtube-dl -f 299+141/299+140/137+141/137+140/bestvideo+bestaudio/best -o "%%(uploader)s/%%(title)s.%%(ext)s" --ignore-errors --download-archive archive.YT -u username -p password :ytsubs --verbose --restrict-filenames  --match-filter "uploader_id != blkdog7 & uploader_id != UC1hlBVlxLDY--Ih2fEyH5nQ"
