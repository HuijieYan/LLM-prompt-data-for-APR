The potential error in the provided function is in the regular expression patterns used to identify comparison and unary operators and their operands. The bug may occur due to incorrect parsing of the filter_part input or mishandling of comparison and unary operators and their corresponding operands within the function.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to review and update the regular expression patterns to ensure they correctly identify the operators and operands in the filter_part input. Additionally, the logic for handling comparison and unary operators and their operands should be thoroughly reviewed and revised as needed.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import operator
import re

def _match_one(filter_part, dct):
    COMPARISON_OPERATORS = {
        '<': operator.lt,
        '<=': operator.le,
        '>': operator.gt,
        '>=': operator.ge,
        '=': operator.eq,
        '!=': operator.ne,
    }
    
    m = re.match(r'(\w*)([<>=!]+)\s*(\w+)', filter_part)
    if m:
        key = m.group(1)
        op = m.group(2)
        value = m.group(3)
        actual_value = dct.get(key)
        
        if op in COMPARISON_OPERATORS:
            op_func = COMPARISON_OPERATORS[op]
            if actual_value is None:
                return value if '?' in op else False
            try:
                comparison_value = int(value)
            except ValueError:
                comparison_value = parse_filesize(value)
                if comparison_value is None:
                    comparison_value = parse_filesize(value + 'B')
                if comparison_value is None:
                    raise ValueError(
                        'Invalid integer value %r in filter part %r' % (value, filter_part))
            return op_func(actual_value, comparison_value)
    
    UNARY_OPERATORS = {
        '': lambda v: v is not None,
        '!': lambda v: v is None,
    }
    
    m = re.match(r'(!?)\s*(\w+)', filter_part)
    if m:
        op = m.group(1)
        key = m.group(2)
        op_func = UNARY_OPERATORS[op]
        actual_value = dct.get(key)
        return op_func(actual_value)
    
    raise ValueError('Invalid filter part %r' % filter_part)
```

In the corrected code, the regular expression patterns for identifying comparison and unary operators and their operands have been simplified to improve readability and ensure proper parsing of the filter_part input. The logic for handling comparison and unary operators and their operands has also been revised to correctly handle the specified operations.
