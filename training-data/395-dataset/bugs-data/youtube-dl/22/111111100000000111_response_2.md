The issue appears to be related to the `_match_one` function in the provided code. It seems to be responsible for parsing filters and applying them to video metadata. The error message in the issue description suggests that there might be a problem with parsing the filter part related to `uploader` or `uploader_id`.

The issue could be related to the regular expressions used in the function, as well as the handling of various comparison operators and filter parts.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to carefully review and potentially re-implement the parsing logic for filter parts. It might involve checking the regular expressions for matching filter parts, handling different comparison operators, and properly evaluating the value to compare with the actual metadata.

Here's the corrected version of the `_match_one` function:

```python
def _match_one(filter_part, dct):
    # ... omitting other parts of the code ...

    try:
        comparison_value = int(m.group('intval'))
    except (ValueError, TypeError):
        comparison_value = parse_filesize(m.group('intval'))
        if comparison_value is None:
            comparison_value = parse_filesize(m.group('intval') + 'B')
        if comparison_value is None:
            raise ValueError(
                'Invalid integer value %r in filter part %r' % (
                    m.group('intval'), filter_part))
    if actual_value is None:
        return m.group('none_inclusive')
    return op(actual_value, comparison_value)

    # ... omitting the rest of the code ...
```

It is important to note that the corrected function only addresses the parsing of comparison values and comparison operators. The remaining parts of the function might also need to be reviewed and corrected.
