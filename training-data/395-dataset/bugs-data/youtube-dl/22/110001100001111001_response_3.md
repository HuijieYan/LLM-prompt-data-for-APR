Potential Error Location:
The bug is likely within the logic for parsing and comparing values in the `_match_one` function. The issue seems to be with the comparison of string and integer values, leading to incorrect comparisons and implications in various parts of the function.

Reasons for the Bug:
1. Incorrect comparison of string and integer values: The function is not handling the comparison of string and integer values properly. This results in incorrect comparisons and potential errors.
2. Inconsistent handling of comparison operations: There seems to be inconsistency in handling comparison operations for different data types, leading to unexpected behavior.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Implement proper handling of string and integer comparisons by ensuring that the comparison logic considers the data type and performs appropriate comparisons.
2. Standardize the handling of comparison operations across different data types to ensure consistency and reliability.

Corrected Code:

```python
def _match_one(filter_part, dct):
    COMPARISON_OPERATORS = {
        '<': operator.lt,
        '<=': operator.le,
        '>': operator.gt,
        '>=': operator.ge,
        '=': operator.eq,
        '!=': operator.ne,
    }
    operator_rex = re.compile(r'''(?x)\s*
        (?P<key>[a-z_]+)
        \s*(?P<op>%s)(?P<none_inclusive>\s*\?)?\s*
        (?P<value>.+?)\s*$
        ''' % '|'.join(map(re.escape, COMPARISON_OPERATORS.keys())))
    m = operator_rex.search(filter_part)
    if m:
        op = COMPARISON_OPERATORS[m.group('op')]
        actual_value = dct.get(m.group('key'))
        comparison_value = m.group('value')
        
        if isinstance(actual_value, int) and not comparison_value.isdigit():
            comparison_value = parse_filesize(comparison_value)
        elif isinstance(actual_value, str) and comparison_value.isdigit():
            comparison_value = str(comparison_value)
        
        if actual_value is None:
            return m.group('none_inclusive')
            
        return op(actual_value, comparison_value)

    raise ValueError('Invalid filter part %r' % filter_part)
```

The corrected code addresses the specific issues identified in the bug analysis. It ensures proper handling of different data types for comparison and standardizes the comparison operations to avoid inconsistencies.
