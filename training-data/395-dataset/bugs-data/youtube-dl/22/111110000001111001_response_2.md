The potential error occurs within the if condition where the actual_value is checked for being a string. If the original field is a string and the comparison value is a number, the original field must be respected and process the comparison value as a string, rather than a number. This behavior needs to be handled in the function to ensure correct comparisons.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to handle the comparison value appropriately based on the type of the original field. If the original field is a string and the comparison value is a number, the comparison value should be treated as a string.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _match_one(filter_part, dct):
    COMPARISON_OPERATORS = {
        '<': operator.lt,
        '<=': operator.le,
        '>': operator.gt,
        '>=': operator.ge,
        '=': operator.eq,
        '!=': operator.ne,
    }
    
    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)
    
    m = operator_rex.search(filter_part)
    if m:
        op = COMPARISON_OPERATORS[m.group('op')]
        actual_value = dct.get(m.group('key'))
        comparison_value = m.group('strval') or m.group('intval')
        
        if (actual_value is not None and isinstance(actual_value, compat_str) and 
            m.group('intval') is not None and not m.group('intval').isalpha()):
            comparison_value = str(comparison_value)  # Treat the comparison value as a string
        
        # Perform the comparison using the operator and comparison value
        if actual_value is None:
            return m.group('none_inclusive')
        return op(actual_value, comparison_value)
    
    # ... (remaining code of the function)
```

With the modification, the function now checks if the actual_value is a string and if the comparison value is a number. If both conditions are met, the comparison value is treated as a string. This should resolve the issue and ensure correct comparisons in cases where the original field is a string and the comparison value is a number.
