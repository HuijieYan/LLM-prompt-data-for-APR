The problem with the current function is that it is not handling the filter parts correctly, causing it to fail in various scenarios, such as when using the `=` operator with strings or when trying to match uploaders with spaces or special characters in their names.

The function needs to be fixed to handle these cases correctly by properly parsing and comparing the filter parts.

One approach to fixing the bug is to update the regex patterns used for parsing the filter parts to handle strings, special characters, and whitespace correctly. Additionally, the comparison logic needs to be revisited to ensure that the comparison between actual and expected values is accurate.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import operator
import re

def _match_one(filter_part, dct):
    COMPARISON_OPERATORS = {
        '<': operator.lt,
        '<=': operator.le,
        '>': operator.gt,
        '>=': operator.ge,
        '=': operator.eq,
        '!=': operator.ne,
    }
    m = re.match(r"(?P<key>[a-z_]+)\s*(?P<op><|<=|>|>=|=|!=)\s*(?P<value>.*)", filter_part, re.IGNORECASE)
    if m:
        key = m.group('key')
        op = m.group('op')
        value = m.group('value')
        
        actual_value = dct.get(key)
        if actual_value is not None:
            if op in COMPARISON_OPERATORS:
                if op in ('=', '!='):
                    comparison_value = value
                else:
                    try:
                        comparison_value = int(value)
                    except ValueError:
                        comparison_value = value
                return COMPARISON_OPERATORS[op](actual_value, comparison_value)
            else:
                raise ValueError(f'Invalid comparison operator: {op}')
        else:
            return False
    else:
        raise ValueError('Invalid filter part format')
```

This corrected code handles the parsing and comparison of filter parts in a more robust way, ensuring that string values and special characters are handled properly. It also includes proper error handling for invalid filter parts.
