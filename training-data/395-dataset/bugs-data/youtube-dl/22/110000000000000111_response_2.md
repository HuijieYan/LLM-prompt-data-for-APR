The error in the provided code is likely in the section where it attempts to handle comparison of strings and numbers, as well as unary operations. The bug seems to be related to the parsing and matching of filter parts which may be causing issues with spaces or dashes in the string.

The potential error in the code is in the handling of string and number comparisons, as well as the unary operations.

The bug might be occurring due to incorrect parsing of filter parts, specifically when handling string and number comparisons.

To fix the bug, it's important to ensure that the filter parts are parsed correctly, and that comparisons involving strings and numbers are handled appropriately. Additionally, the handling of unary operations needs to be reviewed to ensure it's functioning correctly.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import operator
import re

def _match_one(filter_part, dct):
    COMPARISON_OPERATORS = {
        '<': operator.lt,
        '<=': operator.le,
        '>': operator.gt,
        '>=': operator.ge,
        '=': operator.eq,
        '!=': operator.ne,
    }
    operator_rex = re.compile(r'''(?x)\s*
        (?P<key>[a-z_]+)
        \s*(?P<op>%s)(?P<none_inclusive>\s*\?)?\s*
        (?P<value>[0-9.]+(?:[kKmMgGtTpPeEzZyY]i?[Bb]?)?|\w+)
        \s*$''' % '|'.join(map(re.escape, COMPARISON_OPERATORS.keys()))
    )
    m = operator_rex.search(filter_part)
    if m:
        key = m.group('key')
        op = COMPARISON_OPERATORS[m.group('op')]

        actual_value = dct.get(key)
        comparison_value = m.group('value')

        if actual_value is None:
            return m.group('none_inclusive')

        if comparison_value.isdigit():
            comparison_value = int(comparison_value)
        else:
            comparison_value = str(comparison_value)

        return op(actual_value, comparison_value)

    UNARY_OPERATORS = {
        '': lambda v: v is not None,
        '!': lambda v: v is None,
    }
    operator_rex = re.compile(r'''(?x)\s*
        (?P<op>%s)\s*(?P<key>[a-z_]+)
        \s*$''' % '|'.join(map(re.escape, UNARY_OPERATORS.keys()))
    )
    m = operator_rex.search(filter_part)
    if m:
        op = UNARY_OPERATORS[m.group('op')]
        actual_value = dct.get(m.group('key'))
        return op(actual_value)

    raise ValueError('Invalid filter part %r' % filter_part)
```

This corrected code attempts to correctly parse the filter parts, handle comparisons involving both strings and numbers, and correctly process unary operations.
