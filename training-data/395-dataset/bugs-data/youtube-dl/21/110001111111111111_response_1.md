The error seems to be occurring in the `urljoin` function when the base URL is provided as bytes and the path is provided as a string, resulting in the function returning `None` instead of the expected URL.

The error is occurring because the function is not handling the case where the base URL is provided as bytes. It is not properly converting the base URL to a string if it is provided as bytes.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to handle both string and bytes input for the base URL and path.

Here's the corrected code for the `urljoin` function:

```python
import re
from youtube_dl.utils import compat_str, compat_urlparse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
        return None
    base_str = base.decode('utf-8') if isinstance(base, bytes) else base
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not isinstance(base_str, compat_str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base_str):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base_str, path)
```

This modified function checks if the base URL is provided as bytes and decodes it to a string using the `decode` method. It then proceeds to perform the URL joining operation. This change should address the issue and make the function compatible with both string and bytes input for the base URL.
