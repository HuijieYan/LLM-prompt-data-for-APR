Potential Error Location: 
The potential error in the code is at the line `if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:`. This line should check if the `path` variable is a string and not empty, but it currently does not handle the case where the `path` is bytes type.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `path` variable, particularly when it is of type bytes. The function does not properly check for the type of the `path` variable and does not handle the case when it is of bytes type.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the `path` is of type bytes, and if it is, convert it to a string before performing further checks.
2. Update the function to handle both string and bytes types for the `path` variable.

Corrected Code:
```python
import re
from urllib.parse import urljoin as urlparse_urljoin

def urljoin(base, path):
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not isinstance(base, str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return urlparse_urljoin(base, path)
```
