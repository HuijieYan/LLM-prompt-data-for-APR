The bug occurs because the function is not handling the case where the `base` parameter is of type `bytes`. This causes the function to return `None` instead of correctly joining the URL.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle the case where the `base` parameter is of type `bytes`. We also need to ensure that the `path` parameter is always converted to a string before processing.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import re
from six import text_type
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urljoin as compat_urljoin


def urljoin(base, path):
    if not isinstance(path, text_type) or not path:
        return None
    
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    
    if not isinstance(base, text_type):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')  # convert base to str if it's bytes
    elif not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    
    return compat_urljoin(base, path)
```

With this correction, the function should handle both `str` and `bytes` inputs for the `base` parameter. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the function returns the expected URL.
