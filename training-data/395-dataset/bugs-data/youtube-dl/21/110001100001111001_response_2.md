Based on the test cases and the provided function, it looks like the function is intended to take a base URL and a path, and return the joined URL. There are several issues with the given function:
1. It is not handling the base URL correctly when it is provided as bytes.
2. It does not handle the case when the base URL ends with '/', which is a common behavior in URLs.

To fix these issues, the code can be updated as follows:

```python
import re
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/youtube-dl_21/youtube_dl/utils.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def urljoin(base, path):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# The corrected urljoin function
def urljoin(base, path):
    from youtube_dl.compat import compat_str, compat_urlparse

    if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not isinstance(base, compat_str):
        base = base.decode()
    if base.endswith('/'):
        base = base[:-1]
    if not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```
