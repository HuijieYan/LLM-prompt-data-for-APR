The bug in the `urljoin` function seems to be related to checking the type and format of the `path` and `base` parameters within the function. The function is designed to join a base URL with a relative URL path. The error message indicates that the function is returning `None` instead of the expected URL.

The function contains multiple conditions to check the type and format of the `path` and `base` parameters. However, these conditions are not covering all possible scenarios, leading to the bug. For example, the function doesn't handle cases where the `path` parameter is a byte string and the `base` parameter is a string, or vice versa.

To fix the bug, the `urljoin` function needs to have comprehensive checks for different combinations of input types and formats for the `path` and `base` parameters. Additionally, the URL joining operation should be performed correctly based on the input parameters.

Here is the corrected code for the `urljoin` function:

```python
import re
from urllib.parse import urljoin as urlparse_urljoin

def urljoin(base, path):
    if not (isinstance(path, str) and path):
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not (isinstance(base, str) and re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base)):
        return None
    return urlparse_urljoin(base, path)
```

In the corrected code:
- The `compat_str` and `compat_urlparse` have been replaced with the built-in `str` and `urlparse.urljoin` respectively.
- The conditions for checking the type and format of the `path` and `base` parameters have been modified to handle various input scenarios.
- The URL joining operation has been delegated to the `urlparse.urljoin` function to ensure correctness.
