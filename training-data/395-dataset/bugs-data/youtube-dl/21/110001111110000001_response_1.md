Potential Error Location: The if statement checking for the type of the base URL and path may not be correctly handling the inputs provided to the function.

Reasons for the Bug: The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where the base URL is provided as a byte string (b'http://foo.de/') and the path is provided as a regular string ('/a/b/c.txt'). The conditional check for the type of the input is not correctly handling this scenario.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: We can modify the conditional checks to handle both byte strings and regular strings for the base URL and path. Additionally, we can remove the unnecessary checks for None and empty inputs. We may also need to import the required libraries and make use of the correct methods.

Corrected Code:

```python
import re
from .compat import compat_urlparse, compat_str  # assuming the required libraries are imported correctly

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
    else:
        return compat_urlparse.urljoin('http://' + base, path)
```
In the above corrected function, we handle the case where the base URL and path can be either byte strings or regular strings. We also directly use the 'compat_urlparse.urljoin' method instead of 'compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)' to handle the URL joining process correctly. Additionally, unnecessary checks for None and empty inputs are removed as they are not relevant for the URL joining process.
