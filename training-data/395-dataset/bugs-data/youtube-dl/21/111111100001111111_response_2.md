The bug in the code is likely due to the checks for the type of the 'base' and 'path' parameters. The function is designed to join a base URL with a relative path, but the checks for the type of the parameters are causing issues.

The function incorrectly checks if the 'path' is an instance of 'compat_str' and if it's empty before returning None. Also, in some cases, 'path' is being directly returned without joining it with the 'base' URL.

To fix this bug, the type checks for 'base' and 'path' should be removed, and the 'compat_str' and 'compat_urlparse' modules should be updated to work with Python 3.

Here's the corrected code for the 'urljoin' function:

```python
import re
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urljoin

def urljoin(base, path):
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return urljoin(base, path)
```
