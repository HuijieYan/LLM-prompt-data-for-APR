Potential Error Location: The error occurs in the conditional statements that check the types of the 'path' and 'base' variables.

Reasons for the Bug:
1. The function uses a 'compat_str' class when checking the type of the 'path' and 'base' variables, but it does not define what 'compat_str' is. It's unclear what type this represents and it's not a standard Python type.
2. The function uses the 're' module for regular expressions but does not import it, so the 're' module is not available to the function.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Remove the 'compat_str' type checking and replace it with the standard 'str' type checking.
2. Import the 're' module at the beginning of the file to use regular expressions.

Corrected Code:
```python
import re
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def urljoin(base, path):
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not isinstance(base, str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return urljoin(base, path)
```
