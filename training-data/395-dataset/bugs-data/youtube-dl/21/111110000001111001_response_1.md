Potential error location: The error lies in the initial if condition `if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path`, where it checks if `path` is an instance of class `compat_str` and also checks if `path` is not empty. However, in some cases, the function does not handle bytes objects properly.

Reason for bug: The function does not handle byte objects properly and does not account for different combinations of input types for `path` and `base`.

Approach for fixing the bug:
1. First, convert the `path` and `base` to strings using the `decode()` method if they are byte objects. This will ensure that the function is working with string inputs.
2. Use type checking to ensure that the input `path` is a string and not empty, and the `base` is also a string.
3. Use regular expressions to check for the presence of a URL scheme or the absence of a scheme in the `path` and `base`.

Corrected code:

```python
import re

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode()
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode()
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not isinstance(base, str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```
