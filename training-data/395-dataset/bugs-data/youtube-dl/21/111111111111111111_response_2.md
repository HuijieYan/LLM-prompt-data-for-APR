The error occurs when the urljoin function is called with a bytes type as the base URL. This causes the function to return None instead of the expected result.

The issue is caused by the function not properly handling the base URL when it is passed in as a bytes type, leading to the AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'startswith' error.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles both string and bytes types for the base URL.

Here's the corrected code for the urljoin function:

```python
import re
from youtube_dl.utils import compat_str, compat_urlparse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
        return None
    if not isinstance(base, compat_str):
        if isinstance(base, bytes):
            base = base.decode('utf-8')
        else:
            return None
    if not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        path = '//' + path
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```

With this correction, the function should properly handle both string and bytes types for the base URL and produce the expected results for the test cases.
