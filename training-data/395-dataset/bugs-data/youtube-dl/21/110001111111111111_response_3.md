The error is occurring in the test case where the base parameter is given as a bytes type and the path parameter is given as a string type. This is causing the function to return None instead of the expected URL.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the condition where it checks if the base parameter is of type compat_str. Since compat_str is not defined in the code, this condition is causing the function to return None.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the different types of input parameters, especially when the base parameter is provided as a bytes type.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to handle bytes and string types of input parameters. We can use the `isinstance` function to check for both bytes and string types and then convert the parameters to the appropriate type before applying further checks.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re
from .compat import compat_urlparse, compat_str

def urljoin(base, path):
    if not (isinstance(path, compat_str) or isinstance(path, bytes)) or not path:
        return None
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not (isinstance(base, compat_str) or isinstance(base, bytes)) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```
