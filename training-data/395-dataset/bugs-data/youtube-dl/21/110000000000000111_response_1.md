The error seems to be related to the 'sanitize_url' function in the youtube_dl/utils.py file, specifically with the 'startswith' method being called on a 'NoneType' object. This error is occurring when trying to download Twitch videos that are only available to subscribers, and it seems to be a regression introduced in version 2017.03.05.

The bug in the provided code is in the urljoin function. The bug occurs because the isinstance checks are using an undefined 'compat_str' and 'compat_urlparse' and causing the function to return None in some cases.

To fix the bug, you can make the following corrections:
1. Import the necessary modules at the beginning of the file:
```python
import re
from youtube_dl.compat import urlparse
```

2. Replace the isinstance checks with simple type checks:
```python
def urljoin(base, path):
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not isinstance(base, str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```

With these corrections, the urljoin function should work as intended and fix the bug related to downloading Twitch videos that are only available to subscribers.
