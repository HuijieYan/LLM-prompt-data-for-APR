The issue here is that the variable `base` is sometimes passed as a string and sometimes as a byte string. This causes issues with the `isinstance` checks and also with the `re.match` check. 

To fix this, we need to ensure that `base` is always treated as a string. If it is passed as a byte string, we should decode it to a string using the appropriate encoding.

Here's the corrected code for the `urljoin` function:

```python
from youtube_dl.compat import compat_str, compat_urlparse


def urljoin(base, path):
    if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, compat_str):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    elif isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8', 'ignore')
    else:
        return None
    if not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```

This code should handle both string and byte string inputs for `base`, and ensure that it is always treated as a string before the `re.match` check.
