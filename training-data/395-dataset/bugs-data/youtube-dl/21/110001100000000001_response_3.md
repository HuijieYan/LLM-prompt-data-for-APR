Potential Error Location: The condition `if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:` seems to be causing the bug as it returns None if the path is not an instance of compat_str or if it is empty.

Reasons for Bug: The bug occurs because the function is incorrectly checking the type and content of the path variable, leading it to return None in cases where it shouldn't.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the path is a string and if it is not empty, instead of using isinstance and or condition.
2. Use a try-except block to catch any potential errors when joining the base and path.

Corrected Code:
```python
import re
from youtube_dl.compat import compat_str, compat_urlparse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not isinstance(base, str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    try:
        return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
    except:
        return None
```
