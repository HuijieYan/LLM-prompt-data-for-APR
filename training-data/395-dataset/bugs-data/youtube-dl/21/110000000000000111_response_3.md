Potential error location: The potential error location is in the `urljoin` function, specifically in the if conditions that check the types of `path` and `base` and the use of `compat_urlparse.urljoin`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug seems to be occurring because the function `urljoin` is not handling the cases where `path` or `base` are not of type `compat_str` correctly. Additionally, there is an issue with the use of `compat_urlparse.urljoin`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the type of `base` and `path` using isinstance and handle non-compat_str cases accordingly.
2. Use standard library functions for URL manipulation instead of `compat_urlparse.urljoin` which seems to be causing the issue.

```python
import re
from urllib.parse import urljoin as urlparse_urljoin

def urljoin(base, path):
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not isinstance(base, str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return urlparse_urljoin(base, path)
```
