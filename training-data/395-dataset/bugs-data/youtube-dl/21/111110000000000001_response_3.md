The potential error in the provided function is with the `compat_str` and `compat_urlparse` as these are not standard Python libraries. It seems like these are intended to be aliases for the `str` and `urlparse` functions from the `urllib.parse` module, but this is not explicitly defined in the code. 

The function is also missing the import statement for the `re` module, which is used for regular expressions.

To fix the code, we need to define `compat_str` as an alias for `str`, import the `re` module, and correctly import and use the `urlparse` function from the `urllib.parse` module.

Corrected code:

```python
import re
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urljoin

def urljoin(base, path):
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not isinstance(base, str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return urljoin(base, path)
```
