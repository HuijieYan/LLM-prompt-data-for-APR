The error occurs in the `urljoin` function when it returns `None` instead of the expected URL. The bug is likely caused by the conditional checks on the `base` and `path` variables, as well as the incorrect usage of `compat_str` and `re` modules.

To fix the bug, the conditional checks on `base` and `path` should be adjusted to handle both string and bytes inputs properly. Additionally, the `compat_str` and `re` modules should be imported and used correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `urljoin` function:

```python
import re
from youtube_dl.compat import compat_urlparse, compat_str

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, (str, bytes)) and path:
        if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path.decode('utf-8')):  # Check if path is a full URL
            return path.decode('utf-8')
        if isinstance(base, (str, bytes)) and re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base.decode('utf-8')):  # Check if base is a full URL
            return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base.decode('utf-8'), path.decode('utf-8'))
    return None
```

This corrected code handles both string and bytes inputs correctly, and uses `compat_urlparse` and `re` modules as intended.
