The potential error in this function is that it is not properly handling the 'base' parameter. The function is checking if 'base' is a string and if it matches the regex for a valid URL, but it is not handling the case where 'base' is None or an empty string.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where 'base' is None or an empty string. It only checks if 'base' is a string and matches the regex for a valid URL, and returns None if it doesn't. However, it should also return None if 'base' is None or an empty string.

To fix the bug, we should add a check for 'base' being None or an empty string and return None in those cases. Here's the corrected code:

```python
# corrected function
def urljoin(base, path):
    if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
        return None
    if base is None or base == '' or not isinstance(base, compat_str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```
