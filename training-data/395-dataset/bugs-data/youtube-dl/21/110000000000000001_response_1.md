Potential error location: 
The error lies in the if conditions that check for the type of variables "path" and "base". The function is also using "compat_str" and "compat_urlparse" classes that are not defined in the given code.

Reasons for the bug:
1. The function is trying to check the type of "path" and "base" using "compat_str" but this class is not defined in the given code.
2. It is also using "compat_urlparse" to join the base and path, but this class is also not defined in the code.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the standard library functions and methods available in Python to achieve the required functionality.
2. Fix the type checking by using the "isinstance" function with the correct type (e.g. str) to check for string types.

Corrected code:

```python
import re
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def urljoin(base, path):
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not isinstance(base, str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return urljoin(base, path)
```
