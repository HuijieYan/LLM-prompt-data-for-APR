Potential error location: The error seems to be occurring in the `urljoin` function when it tries to check if the base url is valid or not.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the validation for the base URL is not performed correctly. The function is not properly checking if the base URL is valid using regular expressions.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 

1. Use a proper regular expression to validate the base URL.
2. Check if the base URL is valid before trying to join it with the path.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re
from youtube_dl.compat import compat_str
from youtube_dl.compat import compat_urlparse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not isinstance(base, compat_str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```
In the corrected code, the regular expression for validating the base URL is fixed, and it is checked before attempting to join it with the path.
