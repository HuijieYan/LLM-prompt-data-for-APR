The error occurs in the `urljoin` function when a base URL is provided as `bytes`, it returns `None` instead of correctly joining the base and path.

The bug is occurring because the function does not handle base URLs provided as `bytes` properly. It checks whether the base URL is an instance of `compat_str`, which would only be `True` if the base URL is a string, not bytes.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle base URLs provided as `bytes`.

Here's the corrected code for the `urljoin` function:

```python
import re
from youtube_dl.compat import compat_str, compat_urlparse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
        return None
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')  # Decode base URL if it's provided as bytes
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not isinstance(base, compat_str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```
