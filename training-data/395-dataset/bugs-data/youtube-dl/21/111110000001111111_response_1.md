The issue seems to lie in the `urljoin` function, where the function is not correctly handling the different types of input parameters and their values. This leads to an AttributeError when the program tries to sanitize the URL.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the different types of input parameters and their values properly. We can check if the input parameters are strings before performing any operations on them.

Here's the corrected code for the `urljoin` function:

```python
import re
from six import binary_type, text_type
import urllib.parse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if not isinstance(path, text_type) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not isinstance(base, text_type) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return urllib.parse.urljoin(base, path)
```

In this corrected code:
- We use the `six` library to handle both Python 2 and Python 3, and check for `binary_type` and `text_type` instead of `compat_str`.
- We use `urllib.parse.urljoin` to join the base URL and the path.
- We properly check if the input parameters are of type `text_type` before performing any operations.

This should fix the bug and prevent the AttributeError from occurring.
