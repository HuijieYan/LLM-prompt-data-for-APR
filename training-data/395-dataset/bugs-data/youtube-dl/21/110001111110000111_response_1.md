The error occurs in the `urljoin` function, where it is returning `None` instead of the expected URL. This is causing the test case to fail.

The bug is occurring because the function is incorrectly checking the type of the `path` and `base` parameters. Additionally, the function is not handling the cases where `path` is None or an empty string.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to check for None and empty strings for the `path` parameter. The `re` module should also be imported to use the `match` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `urljoin` function:

```python
import re
from youtube_dl.compat import compat_str
from youtube_dl.compat import compat_urlparse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if path is None or path == '':
        return None
    if not isinstance(path, compat_str):
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if base is None or not isinstance(base, compat_str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```

With this corrected function, the test cases should pass without any assertion errors.
