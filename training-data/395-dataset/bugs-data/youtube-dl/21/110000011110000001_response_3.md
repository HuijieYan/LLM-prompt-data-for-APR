The error message shows that for the test case `urljoin(b'http://foo.de/', '/a/b/c.txt')`, the function returned `None` instead of the expected result `'http://foo.de/a/b/c.txt'`. This error occurs due to the incorrect handling of base URL when it is provided as bytes instead of a string.

The potential error location in the code is the `isinstance` check for `base` and `path`. The function should handle bytes and strings differently, but the current implementation doesn't account for this difference.

The bug occurred because the function did not handle the case when the base URL is provided as bytes. The `isinstance` check does not differentiate between bytes and strings, leading to incorrect handling of URLs when provided as bytes.

To fix the bug, we need to include checks for bytes and strings separately, and handle them accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re
from six import string_types
from six.moves.urllib import parse as compat_urlparse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if not isinstance(path, string_types) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not isinstance(base, string_types) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base.decode('utf-8') if isinstance(base, bytes) else base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base.decode('utf-8') if isinstance(base, bytes) else base, path)
```

This corrected code handles the case where `base` and `path` can be provided as bytes or strings, and differentiates between them to handle the URLs correctly.
