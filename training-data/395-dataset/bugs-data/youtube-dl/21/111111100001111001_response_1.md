The buggy function `urljoin` is intended to join a base URL with a relative path to form an absolute URL, but it has several issues:

1. The function checks if `path` is an instance of `compat_str` (presumably a string type) or if it's not empty in the line `if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:`. This is problematic because it does not allow for paths that are empty strings, bytes-like objects, or non-string types.
2. The function contains a reference to `re` module but the `re` module is not imported in the `utils.py` file, which is necessary for using regular expressions.

To fix the bug, you can use the following approach:

```python
import re
from typing import Optional

def urljoin(base: str, path: str) -> Optional[str]:
    if not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```

In this corrected code:
1. We use the `Optional` type hint to indicate that the function may return None.
2. We use the `re` module after importing it, allowing us to use the `match` function to check for the presence of a URL scheme in the path.
3. We remove the check for `compat_str` and simply check if `path` is empty, allowing for different types of empty values, such as empty strings or bytes-like objects.
