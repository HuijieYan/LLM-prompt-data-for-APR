1. The test case involves a regression in the youtube-dl 2017.03.05 version where users are unable to download Twitch videos that are only available to subscribers. The error message indicates an issue with the 'sanitize_url' function in the 'utils.py' file, specifically an attribute error related to 'NoneType' object.

2. The potential error location within the given function is the conditional checks and the return statements. It seems like the function is not handling the base and path parameters correctly, leading to the NoneType error.

3. The occurrence of the bug is likely due to the incorrect handling of the base and path parameters, as well as the improper checks for their types and patterns.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the base and path parameters are properly handled and checked for valid types and patterns before attempting to join them using the compat_urlparse module.

5. Here's the corrected code for the urljoin function:

```python
import re
from six import string_types
import urllib.parse as urlparse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if not isinstance(path, string_types) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not isinstance(base, string_types) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```

In the corrected code:
- We import the necessary modules and define the valid string types.
- We use string_types to ensure compatibility with Python 2 and 3 for checking the type of base and path parameters.
- We use urlparse.urljoin for joining the base and path parameters.

This corrected code should address the bug related to joining URLs and avoid the NoneType error.
