The error is occurring because the `urljoin` function is not able to handle byte strings as input. It is failing for the test case `self.assertEqual(urljoin(b'http://foo.de/', '/a/b/c.txt'), 'http://foo.de/a/b/c.txt')` with an assertion error.

The bug is most likely occurring due to the fact that the function is not handling byte strings properly. It seems that the function is not able to recognize byte strings as valid input and is returning None instead of the expected URL.

To fix the bug, the `urljoin` function needs to handle byte strings as input and process them appropriately to generate the correct URL.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re
from youtube_dl.compat import compat_str, compat_urlparse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if not (isinstance(path, compat_str) or isinstance(path, bytes)) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not (isinstance(base, compat_str) or isinstance(base, bytes)) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```

With this corrected function, the test case should now pass without any assertion errors.
