Potential error location: 
The issue seems to be with the `urljoin` function, specifically with the data type checking and parsing of the `base` and `path` variables.

Reason for the bug:
The bug occurs because the data type checking for `path` and `base` variables is not effective. This results in a None value being returned for valid cases, leading to assertion errors in the test cases.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the data type checking for `path` and `base` to ensure it works correctly for both string and bytes inputs.
2. Revise the conditional statements to correctly handle the cases when `path` or `base` are valid strings or bytes.
3. Adjust the URL parsing logic to accommodate for different input scenarios.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re
from youtube_dl.compat import compat_str, compat_urlparse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if not isinstance(path, (compat_str, bytes)) or not path:
        return None
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not isinstance(base, (compat_str, bytes)) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```
The updated code includes:
1. Revised data type checking for both `path` and `base`, allowing for both string and bytes input.
2. Decoding of `path` and `base` if they are of type bytes, to ensure they are in UTF-8 string format before URL parsing.
