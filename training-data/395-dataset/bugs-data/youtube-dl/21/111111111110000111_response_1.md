The error occurs in the urljoin function which is supposed to concatenate a base URL with a relative path to form a complete URL. The bug occurs in the function as it is returning None in some cases instead of the concatenated URL.

The reason behind the bug is that the function includes checks for whether the base and path are instances of `compat_str` and if the path starts with `https?://`, and if these conditions are not met, it returns None.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary checks and fix the logic for joining the base URL with the path.

Here's the corrected code for the urljoin function:

```python
import re
from urllib.parse import urljoin as urllib_urljoin

def urljoin(base, path):
    if base is None or path is None:
        return None
    return urllib_urljoin(base, path)
```

This code uses the `urllib.parse.urljoin` function from the Python standard library to correctly concatenate the base URL and the path. It also includes a check for potential None values for the base and path, returning None in those cases.
