The error message suggests that the URL is returning `None` instead of the expected value of `'http://foo.de/a/b/c.txt'` for the input `urljoin(b'http://foo.de/', '/a/b/c.txt')`.

The issue seems to stem from the `urljoin` function's handling of input types. The function appears to expect the `path` and `base` parameters to be of type `compat_str`, but it does not handle the case where `base` is of type bytes.

The bug occurs because the function checks if `base` is an instance of `compat_str`, but a bytes type is not an instance of `compat_str`. As a result, the function returns `None` when it encounters a base of type bytes, even if the path is a valid URL.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to handle the case where `base` is of type bytes as well. We can also import the necessary modules and packages used within the function.

Here's the corrected code for the `urljoin` function:

```python
import re
from six import text_type
from urllib.parse import urljoin as urlparse_urljoin

def urljoin(base, path):
    if not isinstance(path, text_type) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not isinstance(base, text_type) and not isinstance(base, bytes):
        return None
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return urlparse_urljoin(base, path)
```

With these modifications, the function should handle both text and bytes types for the `base` parameter, and it should return the expected URL instead of `None` in the test case mentioned.
