The error is occurring in the test case where the base URL is provided as bytes and the path is provided as a string. The function is returning `None` instead of the expected URL.

The bug is caused by the fact that the function is not handling byte strings properly. When the base URL is provided as bytes, the function should convert it to a string before using it to join with the path.

To fix the bug, we will modify the function to handle byte strings properly and ensure that the base URL is converted to a string when necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the `urljoin` function:

```python
import re
from youtube_dl.compat import compat_str
from youtube_dl.compat import compat_urlparse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not isinstance(base, compat_str) and not isinstance(base, bytes):
        return None
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')  # Convert bytes to string
    if not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle both string and byte string inputs for the base URL and provide the expected URL as the output.
