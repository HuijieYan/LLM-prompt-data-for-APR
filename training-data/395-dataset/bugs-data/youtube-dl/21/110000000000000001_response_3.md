Potential error location: 
The potential error location in the provided function is the way it checks the types of the inputs and the conditions for returning None.

Reason for the bug: 
The bug occurs because the function is not correctly checking the types of the inputs and the conditions for returning None. This can lead to unexpected behavior when using the function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the isinstance() function to properly check the type of the inputs.
2. Check for the validity of the base URL before attempting to join it with the path.
3. Return a default value or raise an exception instead of returning None.

Corrected code:

```python
def urljoin(base, path):
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not isinstance(base, str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```
In the corrected code:
1. Used isinstance() to check the type of the inputs as 'str' instead of 'compat_str'.
2. Fixed the condition for checking the validity of the base URL.
3. Kept the return statements consistent with the input type checking conditions.
