The error occurs in the `urljoin` function because when the `base` argument is passed as a `bytes` object, the function returns `None` instead of joining the `path` to the base URL.

The `urljoin` function checks if the `base` is an instance of `compat_str` (which is presumably a string) and whether it starts with `http:` or `https:`. However, it does not take into account the case when `base` is passed as a `bytes` object, which causes the function to return `None` instead of correctly joining the URLs.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to also handle the case when `base` is a `bytes` object. We can use the `isinstance` function to check if `base` is a `bytes` object or a string, and then convert it to a string before performing the comparison for `http:` or `https:`.

Here's the corrected code for the `urljoin` function:

```python
import re
from youtube_dl.compat import compat_str
from youtube_dl.compat import compat_urlparse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not isinstance(base, (compat_str, bytes)) or not (isinstance(base, compat_str) and re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base.decode('utf-8'))):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```

With this corrected code, the `urljoin` function should now be able to correctly handle cases where `base` is passed as a `bytes` object, and the test cases should pass without any errors.
