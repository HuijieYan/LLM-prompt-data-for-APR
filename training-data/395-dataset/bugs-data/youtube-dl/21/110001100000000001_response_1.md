Potential error location: 

The potential error is in the condition where it checks if the base is not an instance of compat_str or if it does not match the regex pattern for URL.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:

The bug occurs because the condition for checking if the base is a valid URL is incorrect. It should be checking if it is a string and if it matches the URL pattern, instead of the current implementation.

Approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Check if the 'base' and 'path' are strings using isinstance() function.
2. Use proper regex pattern to check if 'base' and 'path' are valid URLs.

Corrected code:

```python
from youtube_dl.compat import compat_urlparse, compat_str
import re

def urljoin(base, path):
    if not (isinstance(path, compat_str) and path):
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not (isinstance(base, compat_str) and re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base)):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```
