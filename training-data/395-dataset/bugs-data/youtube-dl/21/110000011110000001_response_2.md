The error message indicates that the function is returning `None` instead of the expected URL, which causes the assertion to fail.

The potential error location within the function is the conditional statement `if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:`. This condition checks if `path` is not an instance of `compat_str` or if it is empty, and if either condition is true, it returns `None`.

The bug occurs because the function is returning `None` when it should be processing the URL based on the `base` parameter.

To fix the bug, we should remove the conditional statement that returns `None` and use the `compat_urlparse.urljoin` method to concatenate the URLs using the `base` and `path` parameters.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re
from six.moves.urllib import parse as urlparse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```
