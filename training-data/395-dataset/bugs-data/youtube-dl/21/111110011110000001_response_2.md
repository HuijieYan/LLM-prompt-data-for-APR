The error occurs in the `test_urljoin` function where the `urljoin` function fails to return the expected URL when the base URL is provided as a byte string.

The potential error location within the `urljoin` function is the comparison of the base parameter with `compat_str`. This comparison does not handle byte strings properly, leading to the incorrect return value of `None` instead of the joined URL.

The bug occurs because the function is not handling byte strings properly. The `urljoin` function needs to account for the different data types of the base and path parameters, specifically when the base is provided as a byte string.

To fix the bug, we need to handle both byte strings and regular strings as the base parameter. Additionally, we should remove the inappropriate use of `compat_str`. Below is the corrected `urljoin` function:

```python
import re
import urllib.parse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return urllib.parse.urljoin(base, path)
```
