Potential error location: The import statement for the re module is missing, which is required for using the re.match() function.

Reason for the bug: The re module is not imported, so the code will raise a NameError when trying to call the re.match() function.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Import the re module at the beginning of the code.

Corrected code:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)/?(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```
