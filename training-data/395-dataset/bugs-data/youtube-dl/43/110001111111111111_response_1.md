The error is occurring because the `url_basename` function is not correctly extracting the basename from the URL. The function is using a regular expression to match and extract the basename, but it is not working as expected.

The potential error location is in the regular expression used in the `url_basename` function to match and extract the basename from the given URL.

The reason behind the bug is that the regular expression used in the function does not accurately capture the basename from the URL.

To fix the bug, the regular expression used in the function should be modified to correctly capture the basename from the URL.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_basename` function:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:\/\/)?[^/]+\/(?:[^/]+\/)?([^/?#]+)[/?#]?', url)
    if not m:
        return ''
    return m.group(1)
```

With this corrected function, the test cases provided should all pass without any assertion errors.
