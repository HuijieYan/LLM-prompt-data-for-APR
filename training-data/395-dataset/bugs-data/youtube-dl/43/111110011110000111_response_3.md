The potential error location within the `url_basename` function is the regular expression used to match the URL. The expression might not be capturing the correct group for the basename.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the regular expression is not capturing the basename correctly, which results in incorrect output for some URLs.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the regular expression to correctly capture the basename from the URL.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_basename` function:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```
