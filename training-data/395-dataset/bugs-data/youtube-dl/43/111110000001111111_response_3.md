Potential Error:
The `re` module is not imported in the provided code, so it cannot be used to create a regular expression object.

Reason behind the Bug:
The `re` module is required to use regular expressions in Python. Since it is not imported in the code, the `re` module cannot be used to create a regular expression object.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Import the `re` module at the beginning of the code to use it for regular expression operations.
2. Use the `re` module functions and methods to create and use regular expressions.

Corrected Code:
```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)/?(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return ''
    return m.group(1)
```
