The error in the `url_basename` function seems to be the regular expression pattern used to extract the basename from the URL. The function is intended to return the last part of the URL after the last slash (excluding any parameters or fragments).

The bug occurs due to the incorrect regular expression used in the `re.match` statement. The regular expression is not correctly capturing the basename from the URL for various input cases, resulting in the function failing the test cases.

To fix the bug, the regular expression pattern needs to be updated to correctly capture the basename. The correct regular expression pattern should look for a sequence of characters after the last slash, ignoring any query parameters or fragments at the end of the URL.

The corrected code for the `url_basename` function is as follows:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'.*/([^/?#]+)(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if m:
        return m.group(1)
    else:
        return u''
```

With the corrected regular expression pattern, the function should now correctly extract the basename from the URL and pass all the provided test cases.
