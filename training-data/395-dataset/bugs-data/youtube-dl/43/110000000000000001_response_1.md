1. The function url_basename(url) is intended to extract the base name from a given URL.

2. The potential error in the code is the regular expression used in the re.match function.

3. The bug occurs because the regular expression used to match the URL and extract the base name is incorrect. It does not properly account for variations in URL structure and may fail to match certain valid URLs.

4. The bug can be fixed by modifying the regular expression to accurately capture the base name from the URL. Additionally, the function should import the re module, as it is not currently imported in the provided code.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:\/\/)?(?:www\.)?[^\/]+\/([^\/]+)\/?$', url)
    if not m:
        return ''
    return m.group(1)
```
