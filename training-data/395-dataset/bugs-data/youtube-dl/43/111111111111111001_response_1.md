The bug in the `url_basename` function is that it simply returns the last part of the path in the URL without considering query parameters or fragments.

As per the error message from the test function, the expected output is not matching the actual output for the case where the input URL is `http://media.w3.org/2010/05/sintel/trailer.mp4`.

To fix this issue, the function needs to consider the query parameters and fragments in the URL while extracting the basename.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_basename` function:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/.*?([^/?#]+)(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return u''

    return m.group(1)
```

With the corrected code, the function will correctly extract the basename from the URL, including handling query parameters and fragments.
