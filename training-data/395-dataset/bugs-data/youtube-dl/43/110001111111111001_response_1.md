#### Analysis
The `url_basename` function is expected to extract the basename from a given URL. For example, if the URL is `'http://foo.de/bar/baz'`, the function should return `'baz'`.

#### Error
The error occurs because the function is not extracting the basename correctly. It is returning an empty string instead of the expected basename.

#### Bug location
The bug is likely in the regular expression used to match and extract the basename from the URL.

#### Reasons behind the bug
The regular expression pattern is not correctly capturing the basename from the URL. This is leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual results.

#### Possible approaches
1. Update the regular expression pattern to correctly capture the basename from the URL.
2. Check the matching groups in the regular expression to ensure that the basename is being correctly captured.

#### Corrected code for the `url_basename` function

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```
