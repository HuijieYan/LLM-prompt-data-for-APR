The error message indicates that the `url_basename` function is not returning the expected result for the test case `url_basename(u'http://media.w3.org/2010/05/sintel/trailer.mp4')`. Instead of returning `trailer.mp4`, it returns an empty string.

The potential error in the `url_basename` function is likely in the regular expression pattern used in the `re.match` function. The regular expression pattern does not seem to match the URL properly to extract the basename as intended.

The bug is caused by the incorrect regular expression pattern, which is failing to capture the basename from the URL.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to modify the regular expression pattern to correctly capture the basename from the URL.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_basename` function:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:\/\/)?[^\/]+\/(?:[^\/?#]+\/)?([^\/?#]+)\/?(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```

With the corrected regular expression pattern, the function should now be able to properly extract the basename from the URL, resolving the bug experienced in the test case.
