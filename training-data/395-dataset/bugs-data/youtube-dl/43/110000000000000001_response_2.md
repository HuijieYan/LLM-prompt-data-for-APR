The potential error in the provided function is that the 're' module from the regular expression is not imported in the code.

Reason for the bug:
The bug is occurring because the regular expression module 're' is not imported in the given function, and the function tries to use the 're' module to match the URL pattern.

Possible approach to fix the bug:
The bug can be fixed by importing the 're' module in the code.

Corrected code:
```python
import re  # Import the 're' module

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)/?(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```
