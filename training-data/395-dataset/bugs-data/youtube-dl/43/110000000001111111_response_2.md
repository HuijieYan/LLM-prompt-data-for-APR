The bug in the provided code is due to the missing `import re` statement. The function uses the `re` module to perform regular expression matching, but it doesn't import the module.

To fix this bug, the `re` module needs to be imported at the beginning of the code. The corrected function is provided below:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)/?(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return ''
    return m.group(1)
```

With the `re` module imported, the function should now work as expected and return the basename from the given URL.
