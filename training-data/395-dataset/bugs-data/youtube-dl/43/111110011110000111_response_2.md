The test case is checking the output of the `url_basename` function for various URLs and expecting the correct basename to be returned. The error message indicates that for the URL 'http://media.w3.org/2010/05/sintel/trailer.mp4', the function is returning an empty string '' instead of 'trailer.mp4'.

The potential error location in the `url_basename` function is the regular expression used in the `re.match` method. 

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely due to the regular expression not capturing the basename correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to update the regular expression to correctly capture the basename from the URL.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_basename` function:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?://)?[^/]+/.*?([^/?#]+)[/?#]?', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```

This updated regular expression should correctly capture the basename from the URL, and the function should return the expected results for the provided test cases.
