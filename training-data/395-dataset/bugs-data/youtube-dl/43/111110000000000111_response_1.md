The potential error in the function is the missing import statement for the 're' module, which is required for using regular expressions. This is evident because the 're' module is used in the function but is not imported at the beginning of the file.

The function is trying to extract the last part of the path from a given URL. However, the error is occurring because the 're' module is not imported.

To fix the bug, we need to import the 're' module at the beginning of the file.

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)/?(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```
