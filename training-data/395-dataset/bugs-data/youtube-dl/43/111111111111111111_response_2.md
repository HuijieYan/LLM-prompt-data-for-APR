The error occurs when the function `url_basename` returns an empty string instead of the expected value for the input `'http://media.w3.org/2010/05/sintel/trailer.mp4'`. This indicates that the function is not correctly extracting the basename from the URL in all cases.

The potential error location within the function is the regular expression used to match and extract the basename from the URL.

The bug occurs because the regular expression used in the function is not able to handle URLs with file extensions properly. The current regular expression `r'(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)/?(?:[?#]|$)'` does not account for file extensions in the URL.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the regular expression to properly handle URLs with file extensions.

Below is the corrected code for the `url_basename` function:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+(?:\.\w+)?)/?(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```

With this correction, the `url_basename` function should now be able to correctly extract the basename for all input URLs.
