The potential error location within the problematic function is the regular expression used in the re.match() function. It is not capturing the correct group from the URL.

Reason for the bug:
The regular expression used in the re.match() function is not capturing the correct group from the URL. The group capturing is not properly handled.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
Update the regular expression to properly capture the basename from the URL.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'.*/([^/?#]+)[/?#]?', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```
