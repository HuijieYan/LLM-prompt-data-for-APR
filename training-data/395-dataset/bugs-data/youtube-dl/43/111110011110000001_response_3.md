The problem with the `url_basename` function is that the `re` module is being used without being imported. This causes the `re.match` method to raise an error, which leads to the function always returning an empty string.

To fix this, the `re` module needs to be imported at the top of the file. Additionally, the regular expression used in the `re.match` method needs to be fixed to correctly extract the basename from the URL.

Here's the corrected `url_basename` function:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly extract the basename from the URL and the test cases should pass without any errors.
