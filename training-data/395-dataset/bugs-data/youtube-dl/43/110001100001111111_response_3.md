The buggy function is `url_basename(url)` which is supposed to extract the basename from a URL. The function is using a regex to match and extract the basename, but the regex pattern is not working properly.

The potential error location in the code is the regex pattern `(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)/?(?:[?#]|$)`. This pattern is not correctly capturing the basename from the URL.

The bug occurs because the regex pattern is not correctly handling different URL formats, including URLs with query parameters and fragments.

To fix the bug, the regex pattern needs to be updated to correctly capture the basename from the URL, including handling query parameters and fragments.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_basename(url)` function:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:[^/]*)?//[^/]+/([^?#]+)[?#]?', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```

This updated regex pattern `(?:https?:[^/]*)?//[^/]+/([^?#]+)[?#]?` will correctly capture the basename from the URL, handling different URL formats including query parameters and fragments.
