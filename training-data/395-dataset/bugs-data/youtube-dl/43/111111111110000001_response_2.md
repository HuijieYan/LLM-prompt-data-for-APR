1. The test case is checking the output of the `url_basename` function for various input URLs. The error message indicates that for the input URL 'http://media.w3.org/2010/05/sintel/trailer.mp4', the expected output is 'trailer.mp4', but the actual output is ''.

2. The potential error location within the `url_basename` function is the regular expression pattern used in the `re.match` function.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the regular expression pattern does not accurately capture the basename of the URL. It fails to extract the basename when the URL contains a file name at the end.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the regular expression pattern to properly capture the basename of the URL.

5. Corrected code for the `url_basename` function:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```
