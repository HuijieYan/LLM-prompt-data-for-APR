The potential error location within the problematic function is in the regular expression used in the re.match function.

Reason for the bug:
The regular expression is not capturing the correct group in all cases. In particular, it fails to handle the case where there is a query string or fragment in the URL.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the regular expression to capture the basename more accurately, including handling query strings and fragments.
2. Use a different method to extract the basename from the URL, such as using the urlparse library.

We can correct the code for the problematic function as follows:

```python
import re
from urllib.parse import urlparse

def url_basename(url):
    parsed_url = urlparse(url)
    path = parsed_url.path
    basename = path.rstrip('/').split('/')[-1]
    return basename
```

This corrected function uses the `urlparse` library to extract the path from the URL and then retrieves the last component of the path as the basename. This approach correctly handles URLs with query strings and fragments.
