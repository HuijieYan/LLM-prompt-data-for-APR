Potential Error Location:
The potential error is likely in the regular expression pattern used in the re.match function.

Reason for the Bug:
The regular expression pattern is not correctly capturing the basename of the URL.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
We should update the regular expression pattern to correctly capture the basename of the URL.

Corrected Code:
```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)/?(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return ''
    return m.group(1)
```
