It seems like the `url_basename` function is not extracting the basename properly from the given URL. The function is using regular expressions, but it's not capturing the correct group to return as the basename.

The error message from the test function shows that the basename returned by the function is not matching the expected basename.

The potential error location is the regular expression used in the `url_basename` function. The group capturing the basename from the URL might not be correctly defined.

The bug occurred because the regular expression pattern in the function was not capturing the proper group. This caused the function to return an incorrect basename, leading to the assertion error.

To fix the bug, the regular expression pattern should be updated to capture the correct group representing the basename from the URL.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_basename` function:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)[/?#]?', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```

This updated function uses a modified regular expression pattern to capture the basename correctly from the URL. Now, the function should return the expected basename for the given URLs.
