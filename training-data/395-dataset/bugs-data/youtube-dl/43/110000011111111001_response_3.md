The bug in the `url_basename` function is causing the test case `test_url_basename` to fail for the input `'http://media.w3.org/2010/05/sintel/trailer.mp4'`. The function is expected to extract the basename from a URL, but it's not returning the correct value for this input.

The potential error location within the function is in the pattern matching using the `re.match` function.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the regular expression pattern used in the `re.match` function is not capturing the basename correctly for some URLs.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the regular expression pattern to correctly capture the basename from the URL.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_basename` function:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```

With this updated regular expression pattern, the function should now correctly extract and return the basename from the input URL for all test cases, including the one that failed previously.
