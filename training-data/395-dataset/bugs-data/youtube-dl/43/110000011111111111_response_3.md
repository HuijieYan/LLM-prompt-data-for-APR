The error occurs because the function is not correctly extracting the basename from the URL. The regular expression used in the function is not capturing the correct group for the basename.

To fix the bug, the regular expression needs to be modified to correctly capture the basename from the URL.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'^(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/([^/?#]+)', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```

This modification captures the desired basename from the URL by extracting the last non-empty segment of the path component in the URL. This should resolve the issue and result in the correct output for the test cases.
