The error is occurring because the `url_basename` function is not returning the expected output for the test cases.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the regular expression used to match and extract the basename of the URL.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the regular expression in the `url_basename` function is not correctly capturing the basename of the URL due to incorrect pattern matching.

To fix the bug, we need to update the regular expression pattern to correctly capture the basename of the URL.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_basename` function:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:)?//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)/?(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```

This updated code includes a correct regular expression pattern that will match the basename of the URL in all the provided test cases.
