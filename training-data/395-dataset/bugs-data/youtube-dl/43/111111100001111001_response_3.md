The buggy function is 'url_basename', and it is attempting to extract the last segment of a URL. However, the regular expression used in the function seems to be insufficient to handle all valid URL formats, which is leading to the bug.

The bug occurs because the regular expression pattern used in the function does not handle URLs with query parameters and fragments correctly. As a result, the function fails to extract the last segment of the URL in some cases.

To fix the bug, we can modify the regular expression to handle URLs with query parameters and fragments more accurately, ensuring that it correctly extracts the last segment of the URL in all cases.

Here's the corrected code for the 'url_basename' function:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'.*/([^/?#]+)[/?#]*', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```

With this modification, the function should now correctly handle URLs with query parameters and fragments, extracting the last segment of the URL accurately.
