The potential error in the code is that the 're' module has not been imported, and the function is using the 're.match' function without the necessary import. This is causing an AttributeError.

The reason behind the AttributeError is that the 're' module is not available to the function, so it cannot access the 'match' function.

To fix the bug, the 're' module needs to be imported at the beginning of the file using: import re

Here's the corrected code:
```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)/?(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```
