The regular expression in the `url_basename` function is not matching the desired pattern correctly. It is failing to capture the desired substring from the input URL. The bug in the function is the incorrect regular expression pattern, which results in failure to extract the desired substring.

To fix this bug, the regular expression pattern should be modified to correctly capture the desired substring from the URL. With the correct regular expression pattern, the function will return the expected output.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_basename` function:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'.*/([^/?#]+)[/?#]?', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```
