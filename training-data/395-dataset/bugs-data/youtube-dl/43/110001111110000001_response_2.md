The test case is using the function `url_basename` to extract the basename from a URL and then compares it with an expected value. The error message indicates that the actual value returned by the function does not match the expected value for the URL 'http://media.w3.org/2010/05/sintel/trailer.mp4'.

The potential error in the function `url_basename` is the regular expression used to extract the basename from the URL. It appears that the regular expression pattern is not correctly capturing the basename from the URL.

The bug occurs because the regular expression pattern does not account for the presence of a file extension in the URL, which causes it to incorrectly extract the basename.

To fix the bug, the regular expression pattern should be modified to capture the basename including the file extension.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_basename` function:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'.*/([^/?#]+\.\w+)', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```

With this modification, the regular expression captures the basename with the file extension included.

The above code snippet should fix the bug and make the `url_basename` function return the correct basename for the provided URLs.
