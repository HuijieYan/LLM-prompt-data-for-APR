Potential error location: The potential error is in the regular expression used in the re.match() function. It looks like the regular expression might not be capturing the correct part of the URL.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The regular expression used in the function is not matching the URL properly, which is causing the function to return an empty string.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The regular expression needs to be modified to correctly capture the basename of the URL. Adjusting the regular expression to properly capture the desired part of the URL will solve the issue.

Corrected code:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'.*?[/=]([^/?#]+)[/?#]|$', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```
