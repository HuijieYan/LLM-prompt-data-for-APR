The potential error in the code is the missing import statement for the 're' module, which is required to use the 're.match' function.

Reason for the bug:
The 're' module is used for regular expressions in Python. In the given code, the 're' module is used for the 're.match' function to match the URL pattern. However, the 're' module is not imported, so the 're.match' function will raise a NameError.

Approach for fixing the bug:
The bug can be fixed by adding the import statement for the 're' module at the beginning of the code.

Corrected code:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)/?(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    # Return the group corresponding to the first parenthesized sub-group
    return m.group(1)
```
