The code has a bug as it does not import the 're' module, which is required for the regular expressions to work. 

To fix the bug, the 'import re' statement should be added at the beginning of the script.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)/?(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```
