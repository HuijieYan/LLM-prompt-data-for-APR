The error occurs in the `url_basename` function because the regular expression used in `re.match` does not capture the correct group for the URL. As a result, the function is returning the wrong value for the input URLs.

The bug occurs because the regular expression pattern `(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)/?(?:[?#]|$)` is not correctly capturing the basename from the URL.

To fix the bug, the regular expression pattern should be modified to correctly capture the basename from the URL.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_basename` function:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?://)?[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)/?(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return ''
    return m.group(1)
```
