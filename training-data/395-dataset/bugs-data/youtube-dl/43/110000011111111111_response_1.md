The error in the function is likely due to the regular expression pattern not correctly capturing the basename of the URL in all cases.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the regular expression pattern is not accurately capturing the basename of the URL.

To fix the bug, we need to update the regular expression pattern to accurately capture the basename of the URL.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_basename` function:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'.*/([^/?#]+)[/?#]?.*', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```

With the corrected regular expression pattern, the function should now accurately capture the basename of the URL in all cases.
