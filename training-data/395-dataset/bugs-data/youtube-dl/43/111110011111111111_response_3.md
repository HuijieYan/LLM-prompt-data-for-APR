The potential error in the code is the regular expression used in the url_basename function. The regular expression is not correctly extracting the last part of the URL.

The bug occurs because the regular expression is not capturing the last part of the URL after the last "/". This is causing the function to return an empty string instead of the expected basename for the URLs.

To fix the bug, the regular expression should be modified to correctly capture the basename of the URL. 

Here is the corrected code for the url_basename function:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)/?(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return url.split('/')[-1]
    return m.group(1)
```

With this modification, the function should now correctly extract and return the basename of the URL.
