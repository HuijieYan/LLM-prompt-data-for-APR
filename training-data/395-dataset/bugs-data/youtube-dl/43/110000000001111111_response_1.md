The potential error in the `url_basename` function is that the `re` module has not been imported, so the `re.match` function cannot be used.

The bug is occurring because the `re` module is needed to use the `match` function. The `re` module provides support for regular expressions.

To fix this bug, the `re` module needs to be imported at the beginning of the code.

Here is the corrected code for the `url_basename` function:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)/?(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```
