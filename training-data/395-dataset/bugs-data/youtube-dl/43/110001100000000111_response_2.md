Potential error location: The regular expression used in the function does not seem to be capturing the desired part of the URL.

Reasons behind the bug:
The regular expression used in the function might not be correctly capturing the basename of the URL due to incorrect pattern matching.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Correct the regular expression pattern to capture the basename of the URL properly.
2. Add the 're' module import to the code.

Corrected code:
```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)/?(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return ''
    return m.group(1)
```
