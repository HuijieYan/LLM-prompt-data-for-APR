The error message from the test function is showing that the expected output is 'trailer.mp4' but the actual output is ''. 

Upon analyzing the function `url_basename`, it seems that the regular expression used in the `re.match` might not be capturing the correct group. The bug seems to be in the regular expression pattern, which is not correctly capturing the basename from the URL.

The regular expression used in the `url_basename` function is not capturing the filename correctly because it is not accounting for the periods and slashes in the filename. To fix this bug, the regular expression pattern should be modified to properly capture the basename of the URL. 

To fix the bug, the regular expression pattern should be updated to capture the basename of the URL properly. The modified function is as follows:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^?#]+/)?([^\?/#]+)(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```

The modified regular expression pattern `(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^?#]+/)?([^\?/#]+)(?:[?#]|$)` now correctly captures the basename of the URL. This should resolve the bug and produce the expected output for the test cases.
