Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the provided code is with the import statement, as the 're' module is not imported in the function.

Reason for the Bug:
The 're' module is used for regular expressions in Python, and it needs to be imported before it can be used. Since it's not imported in the given code, the 're' module's functions cannot be used, leading to a NameError.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the 're' module needs to be imported at the beginning of the function using the import statement.

Corrected Code:
```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)/?(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return ''
    return m.group(1)
```
