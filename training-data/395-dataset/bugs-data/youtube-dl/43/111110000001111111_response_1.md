The issue with the given function is that the regular expression used for matching the URL is not including the '/' character. This causes the function to return an empty string when the URL ends with a '/'. 

To fix this issue, we need to update the regular expression to include the '/' character at the end of the URL.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)[/?#]?', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```

This updated regular expression will match URLs with or without a trailing slash, allowing the function to return the correct basename in all cases.
