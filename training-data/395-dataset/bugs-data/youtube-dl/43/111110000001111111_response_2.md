The function `url_basename` is intended to extract the basename from a URL. The regular expression is used to match and extract the basename.

The issue with the current implementation is that the regular expression pattern is not correctly formatted to capture the basename. The part of the pattern that captures the basename is `([^/?#]+)`, but it is surrounded by optional groups and may not capture the correct part of the URL.

To fix the bug, the regular expression pattern should be modified to more accurately capture the basename.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_basename` function:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)*([^/?#]+)[/?#]?', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```

The modified regular expression pattern ensures that the correct part of the URL is captured as the basename. This should resolve the issue with the function.
