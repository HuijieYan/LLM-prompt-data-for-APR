The error seems to be occurring in the `parse_dfxp_time_expr` function, as indicated by the assertion error in the test case. The function is expected to parse different time formats and return the time in seconds, but it is not returning the expected values in some cases.

The reason for the bug seems to be that the function is not handling the time format '00:00:01:100' correctly. This format should represent hours, minutes, seconds, and milliseconds, but the function does not have a condition to handle this specific format.

To fix the bug, we can add a new condition to handle the '00:00:01:100' format and modify the existing conditions to return the correct values. Additionally, we need to import the 're' module in order to use the regular expression matching.

Here's the corrected code for the `parse_dfxp_time_expr` function:

```python
import re

def parse_dfxp_time_expr(time_expr):
    if not time_expr:
        return None

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<time_offset>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)s?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return float(mobj.group('time_offset'))

    mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return 3600 * int(mobj.group(1)) + 60 * int(mobj.group(2)) + float(mobj.group(3))

    mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d):(\d+)$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return 3600 * int(mobj.group(1)) + 60 * int(mobj.group(2)) + int(mobj.group(3)) + int(mobj.group(4)) / 1000

    return None  # return None if none of the formats match
```

With this corrected code, the function should now handle various time formats correctly and return the expected values. This should address the bug reported in the test case.
