Potential error location: The `parse_dfxp_time_expr` function seems to be the source of the problem because it is used in the conversion process and may not be handling the time expressions correctly.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug is likely occurring because the `parse_dfxp_time_expr` function is not correctly parsing the time expressions in the TTML file, leading to a KeyError when converting to SRT format.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The `parse_dfxp_time_expr` function needs to be modified to correctly parse the time expressions in the TTML file. This may involve updating the regular expressions used for matching the time expressions and ensuring that the correct time values are extracted and returned.

Corrected code for the `parse_dfxp_time_expr` function:

```python
import re

def parse_dfxp_time_expr(time_expr):
    if not time_expr:
        return 0

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<time_offset>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)s?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return float(mobj.group('time_offset'))

    mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return 3600 * int(mobj.group(1)) + 60 * int(mobj.group(2)) + float(mobj.group(3))

    return 0  # Return a default value if no valid time expression is found
```

This corrected function handles the case where no time expression is provided and also ensures that a default value (0) is returned if no valid time expression is found. It fixes the potential issue with the function and should address the TTML to SRT conversion error.
