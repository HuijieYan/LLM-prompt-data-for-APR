Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is in the second regular expression match (mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)$', time_expr)).

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the second regular expression match is not properly capturing the time_expr in the correct format.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the regular expression pattern to properly capture the time_expr in the correct format.
2. Ensure that the groups in the regular expression match are correctly referenced in the return statement.

Corrected Code:
```python
import re

def parse_dfxp_time_expr(time_expr):
    if not time_expr:
        return

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<time_offset>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)s?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return float(mobj.group('time_offset'))

    mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        hours = int(mobj.group(1))
        minutes = int(mobj.group(2))
        seconds = float(mobj.group(3))
        return 3600 * hours + 60 * minutes + seconds
```
