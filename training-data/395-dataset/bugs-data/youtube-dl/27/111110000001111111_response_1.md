The error appears to be related to the conversion of TTML (dfxp) subtitles to another format, resulting in style information loss. The error message specifically mentions a KeyError with the 'dur' key, which indicates that there is a problem accessing the 'dur' key in the subtitle data.

The buggy function `parse_dfxp_time_expr` seems to be related to the conversion of time expressions within the subtitle data. The function uses regular expressions to parse different time formats.

The bug occurs because in the `parse_dfxp_time_expr` function, there are cases where the function doesn't return a value even if a match is found. This is because the function only returns a value if the first or second match is found, but not in other cases.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the function always returns a value, even if no match is found.

Below is the corrected code for the `parse_dfxp_time_expr` function:

```python
import re

def parse_dfxp_time_expr(time_expr):
    if not time_expr:
        return None

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<time_offset>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)s?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return float(mobj.group('time_offset'))

    mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return 3600 * int(mobj.group(1)) + 60 * int(mobj.group(2)) + float(mobj.group(3))

    return None
```

In the corrected code, I added a `return None` statement at the end of the function to ensure that the function always returns a value. This will prevent any unexpected errors related to a lack of return value in certain cases.
