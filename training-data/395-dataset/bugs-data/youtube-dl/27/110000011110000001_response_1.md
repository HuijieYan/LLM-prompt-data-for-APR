The error message indicates that the test case 'parse_dfxp_time_expr('00:00:01:100')' fails because it returns 'None' instead of the expected value '1.1'.

The potential error lies in the second regular expression match:
```python
mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)$', time_expr)
```

The reason for the bug is that the pattern '00:00:01:100' does not match the regular expression pattern. The problem is the extra ':' between the seconds and the milliseconds.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the regular expression pattern:
```python
pattern = r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d)(?::(\d+(?:\.\d+)?))?$'
mobj = re.match(pattern, time_expr)
```

Corrected code:
```python
import re

def parse_dfxp_time_expr(time_expr):
    if not time_expr:
        return

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<time_offset>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)s?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return float(mobj.group('time_offset'))

    pattern = r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d)(?::(\d+(?:\.\d+)?))?$'
    mobj = re.match(pattern, time_expr)
    if mobj:
        hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds = mobj.groups()
        if milliseconds:
            return 3600 * int(hours) + 60 * int(minutes) + int(seconds) + float(milliseconds)
        return 3600 * int(hours) + 60 * int(minutes) + int(seconds)
```
