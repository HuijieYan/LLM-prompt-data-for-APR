The error occurs in the `parse_dfxp_time_expr` function, particularly in the second regex match for the time format '(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)'. The issue arises from the incorrect regex pattern and the misinterpretation of the time format.

The bug occurs because the second regex pattern for parsing time in the format '(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)' is incorrect. The problem is that it's using colons to separate the hours, minutes, and seconds, but it also accepts a colon before the milliseconds. This leads to an incorrect time match.

To fix the bug:
Replace the outdated regex pattern used to match time format with the correct pattern. The correct pattern should be as follows:
```python
r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)$'
```
This pattern uses groups to capture the hours, minutes, and seconds, and the fractional seconds.

Here's the corrected code for the `parse_dfxp_time_expr` function:

```python
import re

def parse_dfxp_time_expr(time_expr):
    if not time_expr:
        return

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<time_offset>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)s?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return float(mobj.group('time_offset'))

    mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return 3600 * int(mobj.group(1)) + 60 * int(mobj.group(2)) + float(mobj.group(3))
```
