The error message indicates that the test case `self.assertEqual(parse_dfxp_time_expr('00:00:01:100'), 1.1)` failed because the function returned None instead of 1.1.

The potential error in the `parse_dfxp_time_expr` function is the second regular expression match. The regular expression `'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)$'` is designed to match the time expression in the format `hh:mm:ss` or `hh:mm:ss.sss`, but it also matches the incorrect format `hh:mm:ss:sss`. The colon between the seconds and milliseconds should be replaced with a period.

To fix the bug, we need to update the second regular expression to match the correct time format. Additionally, we need to import the `re` module, which is missing from the `parse_dfxp_time_expr` function.

Below is the corrected code for the `parse_dfxp_time_expr` function:

```python
import re

def parse_dfxp_time_expr(time_expr):
    if not time_expr:
        return

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<time_offset>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)s?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return float(mobj.group('time_offset'))

    mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(\.\d+)?)$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return 3600 * int(mobj.group(1)) + 60 * int(mobj.group(2)) + float(mobj.group(3))
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly parse the time expression and return the expected results in the test cases.
