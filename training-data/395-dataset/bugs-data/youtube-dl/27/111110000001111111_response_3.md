The issue seems to be related to the conversion of dfxp (TTML) subtitles to another format, resulting in a KeyError. However, the error message does not seem to be directly related to the provided function. 

The potential error location within the `parse_dfxp_time_expr` function is the missing import statement for the `re` module.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug could be that the `re` module has not been imported, leading to the `re.match` function not being recognized.

To fix the bug, the `re` module needs to be imported at the beginning of the script using the statement:
```python
import re
```

Here's the corrected code for the `parse_dfxp_time_expr` function with the missing import statement included:

```python
import re

def parse_dfxp_time_expr(time_expr):
    if not time_expr:
        return

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<time_offset>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)s?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return float(mobj.group('time_offset'))

    mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return 3600 * int(mobj.group(1)) + 60 * int(mobj.group(2)) + float(mobj.group(3))
```

With the `re` module properly imported, the function should now work correctly for parsing the time expressions.
