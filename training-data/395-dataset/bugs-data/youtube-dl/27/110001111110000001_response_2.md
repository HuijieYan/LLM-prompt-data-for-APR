1. The test case '00:00:01:100' is failing with an AssertionError because the function is returning None instead of the expected value 1.1.

2. The potential error lies in the second regex pattern match for '(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)'. This pattern is incorrectly formatted and is causing the function to return None instead of the expected value.

3. The reason for the bug is that the second regex pattern match for the time expression '00:00:01:100' is not correctly capturing the time offset. The pattern is expecting three groups of digits separated by colons, followed by another segment of digits with an optional decimal point. This is causing the pattern match to fail and return None.

4. One approach to fixing the bug is to modify the second regex pattern match to correctly capture the time expression in the expected format. This will ensure that the time offset is extracted and returned as expected.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function 'parse_dfxp_time_expr':

```python
import re

def parse_dfxp_time_expr(time_expr):
    if not time_expr:
        return

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<time_offset>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)s?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return float(mobj.group('time_offset'))

    mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d{2}):(\d{2}(?:\.\d+)?)$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return 3600 * int(mobj.group(1)) + 60 * int(mobj.group(2)) + float(mobj.group(3))
```

With this corrected code, the function should now correctly parse the time expressions and return the expected time offset values for the given test cases.
