The bug appears to be occurring in the `parse_dfxp_time_expr` function, which is used to parse time expressions in the DFXP (TTML) subtitle format. The function is intended to handle different formats of time expressions and return the parsed value. 

The function currently has a few issues:
1. It doesn't handle the case when the input time_expr is empty, which can lead to unexpected behavior.
2. The function uses the `re` module for pattern matching but fails to import it.
3. The function doesn't handle the case when the input time_expr is in the format "hh:mm:ss" or "hh:mm:ss.s" correctly.
4. The function doesn't return a value if none of the pattern matches are found, which can also lead to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to handle all possible input scenarios and return the correct parsed value. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def parse_dfxp_time_expr(time_expr):
    if not time_expr:
        return 0.0  # Return default value when time_expr is empty

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<time_offset>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)s?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return float(mobj.group('time_offset'))

    mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return 3600 * int(mobj.group(1)) + 60 * int(mobj.group(2)) + float(mobj.group(3))

    return 0.0  # Return default value if no pattern matches are found
```

This corrected code addresses the issues mentioned and should provide a more reliable parsing of time expressions in the DFXP format.
