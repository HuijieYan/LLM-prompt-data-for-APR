The error occurs in the `test_parse_dfxp_time_expr` function where the test case `parse_dfxp_time_expr('00:00:01:100')` is failing with an AssertionError: None != 1.1.

The potential error location within the `parse_dfxp_time_expr` function is the second regular expression match:
```python
mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)$', time_expr)
```
This regular expression is expecting the time_expr to be in the format hh:mm:ss, however, the provided test case has an extra colon and milliseconds portion at the end (hh:mm:ss:ms).

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the regular expressions used in the function are not matching the input time_expr with an extra colon and milliseconds at the end.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the regular expressions to match the time_expr with an extra colon and milliseconds portion at the end.

Here's the corrected code for the `parse_dfxp_time_expr` function:

```python
import re

def parse_dfxp_time_expr(time_expr):
    if not time_expr:
        return

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<time_offset>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)s?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return float(mobj.group('time_offset'))

    mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d)(?::|\.)(\d+)$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return 3600 * int(mobj.group(1)) + 60 * int(mobj.group(2)) + int(mobj.group(3)) + int(mobj.group(4)) / 1000.0

```

With the provided fix, the regular expression in the second match now allows for an extra colon or dot and milliseconds at the end of the time expression. This should resolve the issue with the failing test case.
