The test case that fails is the following:
```python
self.assertEqual(parse_dfxp_time_expr('00:00:01:100'), 1.1)
```
The error message from the failed test case is:
```
AssertionError: None != 1.1
```

The potential error location within the function is the second regex match:
```python
mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)$', time_expr)
```
Since the regex pattern does not account for the format '00:00:01:100' (with an additional ':' before the milliseconds), the regex match fails and the function returns None instead of the expected value.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the second regex match pattern is not able to handle the time format provided in the failed test case.

To fix the bug, the regex pattern for the second match should be modified to handle the time format '00:00:01:100'. Additionally, the function should return None if none of the patterns match the input time_expr.

Here's the corrected code for the function with added import for the 're' module and the modified regex patterns:
```python
import re

def parse_dfxp_time_expr(time_expr):
    if not time_expr:
        return None

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<time_offset>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)s?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return float(mobj.group('time_offset'))

    mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d):?(\d*)$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        hours = int(mobj.group(1))
        minutes = int(mobj.group(2))
        seconds = int(mobj.group(3))
        milliseconds = int(mobj.group(4)) if mobj.group(4) else 0
        return 3600 * hours + 60 * minutes + seconds + milliseconds / 1000

    return None
```
