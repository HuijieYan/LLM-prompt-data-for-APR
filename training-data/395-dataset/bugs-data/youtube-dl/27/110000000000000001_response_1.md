Potential Error Location: 
The potential error location is in the second regular expression match (mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)$', time_expr)). The error may be happening because it's missing a group for the seconds in the timestamp.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug is occurring because the second regular expression match is not capturing the seconds part of the timestamp correctly, causing the function to return incorrect results.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Add a group for the seconds in the second regular expression match to capture the correct time format.
2. Make sure to handle the case where the input time_expr is not valid and return an appropriate response.

Corrected Code:
```python
import re

def parse_dfxp_time_expr(time_expr):
    if not time_expr:
        return

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<time_offset>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)s?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return float(mobj.group('time_offset'))

    mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        hours = int(mobj.group(1))
        minutes = int(mobj.group(2))
        seconds = float(mobj.group(3))
        return 3600 * hours + 60 * minutes + seconds
    else:
        return None  # return an appropriate response for an invalid time_expr
```
