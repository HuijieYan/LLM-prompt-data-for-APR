The error message indicates that when the input is '00:00:01:100', the function is returning None instead of 1.1, which is causing the assertion error.

The potential error location is in the second regex pattern matching for the time expression '00:00:01:100'.

The bug occurs because the second regex pattern is incorrect, and it does not match the time expression '00:00:01:100' as intended.

To fix the bug, we need to update the second regex pattern to correctly match the time expression '00:00:01:100'.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def parse_dfxp_time_expr(time_expr):
    if not time_expr:
        return

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<time_offset>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)s?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return float(mobj.group('time_offset'))

    mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d)(?:\.\d+)?$', time_expr)  # Updated regex pattern
    if mobj:
        return 3600 * int(mobj.group(1)) + 60 * int(mobj.group(2)) + float(mobj.group(3))
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly parse the time expressions and return the expected values.
