The provided function `parse_dfxp_time_expr` is expected to parse different time expressions used in captions, but it seems to have some issues. 

The function uses regular expressions to match different time expression formats, such as 's' and 'hh:mm:ss.sss'. The bug occurs because the function does not handle all the cases properly, leading to errors during the conversion process.

The potential error location within the function is the use of the regular expressions and the return statements for different cases. It seems that the function does not cover all the possible time expression formats.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to update the function to handle all time expression formats properly and return the correct time offset value. This may involve refining the regular expressions to cover all possible cases and ensuring that the returned time offset value is calculated correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
import re

def parse_dfxp_time_expr(time_expr):
    if not time_expr:
        return 0.0

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<time_offset>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)s?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return float(mobj.group('time_offset'))

    mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return 3600 * int(mobj.group(1)) + 60 * int(mobj.group(2)) + float(mobj.group(3))
    
    # handle the case for 'hh:mm:ss.sss' format
    mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d\.\d+)$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return 3600 * int(mobj.group(1)) + 60 * int(mobj.group(2)) + float(mobj.group(3))

    # handle the case for 'hh:mm:ss:s' format
    mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d:\d+)$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        parts = time_expr.split(':')
        seconds = float(parts[-1])
        for part in reversed(parts[:-1]):
            seconds = float(part) * 60 + seconds
        return seconds

    return 0.0
```

This corrected function handles different time expression formats, including 's', 'hh:mm:ss.sss', 'hh:mm:ss:s', and returns the correct time offset value for each case. This should resolve the issue with the TTML to SRT conversion error.
