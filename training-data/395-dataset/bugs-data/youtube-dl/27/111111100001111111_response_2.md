Looking at the test cases and the error message, it seems that the issue may be related to the conversion of TTML (dfxp) subtitles to SRT format. The error message specifically mentions a KeyError for 'dur', which could be related to the parsing of time expressions in the subtitles.

The buggy function `parse_dfxp_time_expr` is responsible for parsing time expressions in the TTML subtitles. The function tries to match different time expression formats and convert them to seconds. However, there are a couple of issues in the function that could lead to unexpected behavior:

1. The function doesn't handle the case when none of the regex patterns match the `time_expr`. It should return a default value in such cases.

2. The second regex pattern for `time_expr` of the format `hh:mm:ss.sss` doesn't handle the case where the hours part is greater than 9.

To fix these issues, we can modify the function to properly handle all cases and return the parsed time in seconds.

Here's the corrected code for the `parse_dfxp_time_expr` function:

```python
import re

def parse_dfxp_time_expr(time_expr):
    if not time_expr:
        return 0  # Return a default value when time_expr is empty

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<time_offset>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)s?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return float(mobj.group('time_offset'))

    mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        hours = int(mobj.group(1))
        minutes = int(mobj.group(2))
        seconds = float(mobj.group(3))
        return 3600 * hours + 60 * minutes + seconds

    return 0  # Return a default value when no match is found
```

With the corrections made, the function now properly handles all cases and returns the parsed time in seconds. This should address the TTML to SRT conversion error mentioned in the issue.
