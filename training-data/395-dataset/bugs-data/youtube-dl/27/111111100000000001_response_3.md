Potential Error:
The potential error lies in the regex pattern being used in the `re.match` function. It seems that the pattern is not correctly capturing the different time formats that the function is supposed to handle.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug is occurring because the regex patterns are not capturing the time expressions in the expected format, leading to incorrect parsing.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the regex patterns to correctly capture the different time formats.
2. Add error handling for cases where the time expression does not match any of the regex patterns.

Corrected Code:
```python
import re

def parse_dfxp_time_expr(time_expr):
    if not time_expr:
        return None

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<time_offset>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)s?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return float(mobj.group('time_offset'))

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<hours>\d+):(?P<minutes>\d\d):(?P<seconds>\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        hours = int(mobj.group('hours'))
        minutes = int(mobj.group('minutes'))
        seconds = float(mobj.group('seconds'))
        return 3600 * hours + 60 * minutes + seconds

    return None  # if no valid time expression is matched
```
