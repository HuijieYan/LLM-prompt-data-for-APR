Potential error location: The error seems to be related to the conversion of dfxp (TTML) subtitles into another format, resulting in style information loss. The error message specifically mentions a KeyError related to the 'dur', indicating that there is an issue with the key 'dur' not being found.

Reason for the bug: The provided code does not handle all possible cases for parsing the time expressions in the subtitles, leading to incomplete or incorrect parsing.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We need to ensure that the time expressions are properly parsed for both types of time formats (e.g., '1:23:45' and '90s') and that the correct key-value pairs are used for the parsed data.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def parse_dfxp_time_expr(time_expr):
    if not time_expr:
        return

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<time_offset>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)s?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return float(mobj.group('time_offset'))

    mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return 3600 * int(mobj.group(1)) + 60 * int(mobj.group(2)) + float(mobj.group(3))

    # Add handling for additional time format
    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<hours>\d+):(?P<minutes>\d+):(?P<seconds>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        hours = int(mobj.group('hours'))
        minutes = int(mobj.group('minutes'))
        seconds = float(mobj.group('seconds'))
        return 3600 * hours + 60 * minutes + seconds
```
