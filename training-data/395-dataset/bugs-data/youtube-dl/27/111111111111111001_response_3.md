The current implementation of the `parse_dfxp_time_expr` function has a bug that causes it to return `None` instead of the expected time value. 

The issue arises from the fact that the function has multiple return statements, and some of the return paths are not handled properly. For example, when the input `time_expr` is an empty string, the function should return `None`, but the implemented code does not handle this case correctly.

To fix this issue, we can modify the function to handle all possible cases of the `time_expr` input and consistently return the expected output. Additionally, we should also ensure that the regular expression matches are properly handled and converted to the desired time format.

Here's the corrected implementation of the `parse_dfxp_time_expr` function:

```python
import re

def parse_dfxp_time_expr(time_expr):
    if not time_expr:
        return None

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<time_offset>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)s?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return float(mobj.group('time_offset'))

    mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return 3600 * int(mobj.group(1)) + 60 * int(mobj.group(2)) + float(mobj.group(3))

    return None  # Default return statement if no match is found
```

With this corrected implementation, the function will handle all possible cases of the `time_expr` input and consistently return the expected output. This should resolve the issue and make the test cases pass successfully.
