The potential error location in the code is the fact that the function does not have a return statement if neither of the if conditions are satisfied.

The bug occurs because if none of the if conditions are true, the function does not return anything, which may be unintended.

To fix this bug, we can add a return statement at the end of the function to return None if none of the if conditions are met.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re

def parse_dfxp_time_expr(time_expr):
    if not time_expr:
        return None

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<time_offset>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)s?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return float(mobj.group('time_offset'))

    mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return 3600 * int(mobj.group(1)) + 60 * int(mobj.group(2)) + float(mobj.group(3))
    
    return None
```
