The function `parse_dfxp_time_expr` is supposed to parse a time expression and return the corresponding time in seconds. However, there are some issues in the function that lead to incorrect outputs for some inputs.

The potential error location is in the second regex match statement:
```python
mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return 3600 * int(mobj.group(1)) + 60 * int(mobj.group(2)) + float(mobj.group(3))
```
The issue is with the regex pattern. The pattern is not able to match the time format with milliseconds (e.g., `00:00:01.100`) and the one with incorrect format (e.g., `00:00:01:100`).

To fix the issue:
1. Update the regex pattern to match the time format with milliseconds.
2. Add a check to return None if the time format is incorrect.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re

def parse_dfxp_time_expr(time_expr):
    if not time_expr:
        return

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<time_offset>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)s?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return float(mobj.group('time_offset'))

    mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d)(?:\.(\d{1,3}))?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        hours = int(mobj.group(1))
        minutes = int(mobj.group(2))
        seconds = int(mobj.group(3))
        milliseconds = int(mobj.group(4)) if mobj.group(4) else 0
        return 3600 * hours + 60 * minutes + seconds + milliseconds / 1000

    return None  # Return None for incorrect time format
```

With this correction, the test cases should now pass without any assertion errors.
