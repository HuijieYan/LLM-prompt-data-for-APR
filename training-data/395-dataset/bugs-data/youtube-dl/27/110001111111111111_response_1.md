Based on the error message from the test function and the associated issue description, it seems that there is an error in the conversion of TTML to SRT subtitles due to a KeyError. 

The potential error location within the problematic function is the second regex match where the time expression is in the format `00:00:01:100`. The regex pattern `'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)$'` is not able to handle the time expression in this format, which leads to the KeyError when converting TTML to SRT subtitles.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the regex pattern is not designed to handle the time expression in the format `00:00:01:100`, resulting in a failure to parse the time expression properly.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the second regex pattern to support the time expression in the format `00:00:01:100`. This can be achieved by modifying the pattern to `r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d)(?::|\.)(\d+)$'` which allows for both colons and periods as the separator between seconds and milliseconds.

Here's the corrected code for the `parse_dfxp_time_expr` function:

```python
import re

def parse_dfxp_time_expr(time_expr):
    if not time_expr:
        return

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<time_offset>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)s?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return float(mobj.group('time_offset'))

    mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d)(?::|\.)(\d+)$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return 3600 * int(mobj.group(1)) + 60 * int(mobj.group(2)) + int(mobj.group(3)) + (int(mobj.group(4)) / 1000)

# Test cases should now pass without errors
```

With this modification, the test cases should pass without any errors and the TTML to SRT conversion issue should be resolved.
