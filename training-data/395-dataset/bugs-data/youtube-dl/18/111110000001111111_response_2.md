The potential error in the problematic function is with the `force_properties` dictionary. The `force_properties` dictionary is created with some of the key-value pairs from `ie_result`, and then it's used to update the `info` dictionary. However, the `force_properties` dictionary is missing the 'id' key from `ie_result` in the second buggy test case. This might lead to incorrect information being propagated to the `info` dictionary.

To fix this, 'id' should also be included in the `force_properties` dictionary.

The corrected code for the problematic function is:

```python
def process_ie_result(self, ie_result, download=True, extra_info={}):
    # ... (other code)

    if result_type == 'url_transparent':
        # (other code)

        force_properties = dict(
            (k, v) for k, v in ie_result.items() if v is not None)
        for f in ('_type', 'url', 'ie_key'):
            if f in force_properties:
                del force_properties[f]
        force_properties.update({'id': ie_result.get('id', '')})  # Include 'id' in force_properties
        new_result = info.copy()
        new_result.update(force_properties)
        # (other code)
    # ... (other code)
```

This change ensures that the 'id' key from `ie_result` is included in the `force_properties` dictionary, which is then used to update the `info` dictionary.
