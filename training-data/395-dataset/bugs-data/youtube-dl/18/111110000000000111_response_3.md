The potential error in the function is that there are several lines of code that reference functions like `self.add_extra_info` and `ie_result.get`, but the `ie_result` parameter is never explicitly declared. This could cause errors if the function is called without the proper parameters.

The potential error occurs because the `ie_result` parameter is being used before it is declared within the function. This could lead to errors when attempting to use the `ie_result` parameter without a valid reference.

To fix the bug, the `ie_result` parameter should be explicitly declared at the beginning of the function. 

```python
def process_ie_result(self, ie_result, download=True, extra_info={}):
    """
    Take the result of the ie(may be modified) and resolve all unresolved
    references (URLs, playlist items).

    It will also download the videos if 'download'.
    Returns the resolved ie_result.
    """
    ie_result = ie_result
    # rest of the code remains the same
```
