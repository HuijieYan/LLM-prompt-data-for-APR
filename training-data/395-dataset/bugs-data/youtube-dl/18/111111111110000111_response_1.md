The test function `test_do_not_override_ie_key_in_url_transparent` is testing the behavior of the `process_ie_result` function in the `YoutubeDL` class. The function uses a series of test classes (`Foo1IE`, `Foo2IE`, and `Foo3IE`) that define different InfoExtractors and their behavior. The test expects that the `id` field of the downloaded result should be 'testid', but it is currently 'foo1_id', leading to an assertion error.

The bug is likely located in the `process_ie_result` function within the `YoutubeDL` class. The bug is likely caused by the function not overriding the `ie_key` when processing a URL type of result. Instead, it should use the `ie_key` from the extracted info.

To fix the bug, the `process_ie_result` function needs to properly handle 'url_transparent' type results, ensuring that it uses the `ie_key` from the extracted info instead of using the `ie_key` from the original result.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_ie_result` function:

```python
def process_ie_result(self, ie_result, download=True, extra_info={}):
    # ... Previous code ...

    if result_type == 'url_transparent':
        # Use the information from the embedding page
        info = self.extract_info(
            ie_result['url'], ie_key=ie_result.get('ie_key'),
            extra_info=extra_info, download=False, process=False)

        # Extracted info may not be a video result (i.e.
        # info.get('_type', 'video') != video) but rather an url or
        # url_transparent. In such cases outer metadata (from ie_result)
        # should be propagated to inner one (info).
        if not info:
            return info

        # Override ie_key with the one from extracted info
        info['ie_key'] = ie_result.get('ie_key')

        return self.process_ie_result(
            info, download=download, extra_info=extra_info)

    # ... Remaining code ...

```

With this fix, the `process_ie_result` function should properly use the `ie_key` from the extracted info for 'url_transparent' type results, resolving the bug described in the error message.
