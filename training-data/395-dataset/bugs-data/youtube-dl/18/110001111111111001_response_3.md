The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect handling of the `ie_key` attribute when extracting the information. The `ie_key` attribute should be preserved and not overwritten while handling the 'url_transparent' type.

The bug occurs because the `ie_key` attribute is being overwritten with the 'Foo1' value in the 'new_result' dictionary when the '_type' is 'url_transparent'. This is due to the incorrect assignment in the function.

To fix this bug, the assignment of 'ie_key' in the 'new_result' dictionary should be handled separately to ensure that the original 'ie_key' value is preserved.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def process_ie_result(self, ie_result, download=True, extra_info={}):
    # ... (previous code)

    if result_type == 'url_transparent':
        if new_result.get('_type') == 'url':
            new_result['_type'] = 'url_transparent'
            if 'ie_key' in force_properties:
                new_result['ie_key'] = force_properties['ie_key']  # Preserve the original ie_key value
        return self.process_ie_result(
            new_result, download=download, extra_info=extra_info)
    # ... (remaining code)
```

By preserving the original value of `ie_key` when the result type is 'url_transparent', we will ensure that it is not overwritten with a different value, resulting in the resolution of the bug.
