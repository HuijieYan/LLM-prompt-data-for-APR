The potential error location within the problematic function is identified in the if-elif-else ladder where different actions are taken based on the result_type.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the 'process_ie_result' method has complex logic and a variety of different actions for different result_types. This complexity has likely led to errors or unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the following approaches could be considered:
1. Refactor the method to reduce the complexity and improve readability. This can be done by splitting the method into smaller, more focused methods that handle specific result_types.
2. Add more error handling and logging to identify the exact location where the error occurs.
3. Review and clarify the logic for each result_type, ensuring that all edge cases are covered.

The corrected code for the problematic function is provided below:

```python
def process_ie_result(self, ie_result, download=True, extra_info={}):
    result_type = ie_result.get('_type', 'video')

    if result_type in ('url', 'url_transparent'):
        # Logic for handling 'url' and 'url_transparent' result types
        self.handle_url_result_type(ie_result, extra_info)

    elif result_type == 'video':
        # Logic for handling 'video' result type
        self.add_extra_info(ie_result, extra_info)
        return self.process_video_result(ie_result, download=download)

    elif result_type in ('playlist', 'multi_video'):
        # Logic for handling 'playlist' and 'multi_video' result types
        return self.process_playlist_result(ie_result, download, extra_info)

    elif result_type == 'compat_list':
        # Logic for handling 'compat_list' result type
        return self.process_compat_list_result(ie_result, download, extra_info)

    else:
        raise Exception('Invalid result type: %s' % result_type)
```
