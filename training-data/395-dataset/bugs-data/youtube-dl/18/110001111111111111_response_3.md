The error occurs when the 'id' is being checked in the test function. The 'id' does not match the expected value, leading to an assertion error.

The bug occurs in the code segment where a new result is being created inside the method `process_ie_result`. When a new result is created, the 'id' is being overwritten with a different value.

To fix this bug, we should retain the original 'id' when creating the new result. This can be done by updating the 'new_result' with the original 'id' from the ie_result.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_ie_result` function:

```python
def process_ie_result(self, ie_result, download=True, extra_info={}):
    # ... (other code)

    if result_type in ('url_transparent'):
        # ... (other code)

        new_result = ie_result.copy()
        new_result.update(force_properties)

        # Retain the original id from ie_result
        if 'id' in ie_result:
            new_result['id'] = ie_result['id']

        return self.process_ie_result(new_result, download=download, extra_info=extra_info)

    # ... (other code)
```

By retaining the original 'id' from the ie_result, the bug is fixed and the test case should pass without any assertion errors.
