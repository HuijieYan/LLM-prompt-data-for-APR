The error appears to be in the test function, where there is an assertion failure for the downloaded info dictionary's 'id' field.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `process_ie_result` method. The method seems to be incorrectly reusing the 'ie_key' from the input `ie_result` when generating a new 'ie_key' for the extracted info. This is leading to the wrong 'id' in the downloaded info dictionary.

The reason for the bug is that the 'ie_key' from the input `ie_result` should not be reused when generating the new 'ie_key' for the extracted info.

To fix the bug, update the `process_ie_result` method to generate a new 'ie_key' for the extracted info instead of reusing the 'ie_key' from the input `ie_result`. This will ensure that the correct 'id' is set in the downloaded info dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_ie_result` method:

```python
def process_ie_result(self, ie_result, download=True, extra_info={}):
    # ... existing code ...

    if result_type == 'url_transparent':
        # Existing code ...
        new_result = info.copy()
        new_result.update(force_properties)
        new_result['_type'] = 'url_transparent'  # Set the correct type for the new_result

        return self.process_ie_result(
            new_result, download=download, extra_info=extra_info)
    # ... existing code ...
```

By making this change, the bug in the `process_ie_result` method should be fixed, and the assertion error in the test function should be resolved.
