The error occurs when the test function is trying to compare the 'id' attribute of the downloaded info with the expected value 'testid'. The downloaded 'id' attribute is 'foo1_id' instead of 'testid'.

The potential error location within the problematic function is identified as the handling of 'ie_key' attribute while processing 'url_transparent' type result.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is the incorrect handling of 'ie_key' attribute when processing 'url_transparent' type result, which leads to the override of 'ie_key' with the new value. This causes the downloaded info to have an incorrect 'id' attribute.

To fix the bug, the 'ie_key' attribute should not be overridden when processing 'url_transparent' type result. The 'ie_key' attribute from the original result should be preserved in the processed result.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def process_ie_result(self, ie_result, download=True, extra_info={}):
    """
    Take the result of the ie(may be modified) and resolve all unresolved
    references (URLs, playlist items).

    It will also download the videos if 'download'.
    Returns the resolved ie_result.
    """
    # ... (omitted code)

    if result_type in ('url', 'url_transparent'):
        ie_result['url'] = sanitize_url(ie_result['url'])
        extract_flat = self.params.get('extract_flat', False)
        if ((extract_flat == 'in_playlist' and 'playlist' in extra_info) or
                extract_flat is True):
            if self.params.get('forcejson', False):
                self.to_stdout(json.dumps(ie_result))
            return ie_result
        else:
            # Preserve the 'ie_key' attribute from the original result
            if 'ie_key' in ie_result:
                extra_info['ie_key'] = ie_result['ie_key']

    # ... (omitted code)

    return ie_result
```

In the corrected code, when processing 'url_transparent' type result, the 'ie_key' attribute from the original result is preserved in the 'extra_info' dictionary. This ensures that the 'ie_key' attribute is not overridden and is retained in the processed result.
