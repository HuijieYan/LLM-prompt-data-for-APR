The test case `test_do_not_override_ie_key_in_url_transparent` is using a set of InfoExtractors to create a mock environment and running `ydl.extract_info('foo1:')`. It then checks if the extracted info matches the expected values. The error message indicates that the extracted value for `id` does not match the expected value.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely to be in the `process_ie_result` method, specifically in the part where it handles the result type 'url_transparent'.

The bug occurs because the 'id' is not correctly propagated through the `process_ie_result` method when handling the 'url_transparent' result type.

To fix the bug, the 'id' should be carried forward to the final result if it is available, regardless of the result type.

Here is the corrected code for the `process_ie_result` method:

```python
def process_ie_result(self, ie_result, download=True, extra_info={}):
    result_type = ie_result.get('_type', 'video')

    if 'id' in ie_result and 'id' not in extra_info:
        extra_info['id'] = ie_result['id']

    # ... (other parts of the method remain the same)
```

This change ensures that the 'id' is carried forward in the `extra_info` dictionary so that it can be used in the final result.
