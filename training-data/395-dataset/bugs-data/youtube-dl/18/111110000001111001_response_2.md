The bug in the `process_ie_result` function is due to the use of mutable default argument `extra_info={}`. When the function is called, the same dictionary is referenced by all calls, leading to unexpected behavior when the dictionary is modified.

The following changes can be made to fix the bug:

1. Instead of using `extra_info={}` as the default argument, use `extra_info=None`.
2. Inside the function, check if `extra_info` is None, and if so, create an empty dictionary.
3. Make a copy of the default `extra_info` and update it inside the function to prevent modifying the original dictionary.

Here is the corrected `process_ie_result` function:

```python
def process_ie_result(self, ie_result, download=True, extra_info=None):
    if extra_info is None:
        extra_info = {}
    """
    Rest of the function remains the same
    """
```

These changes ensure that a new dictionary is created for each function call, preventing unexpected modification of shared data.
