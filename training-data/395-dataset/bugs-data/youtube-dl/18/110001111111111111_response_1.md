The test case "test_do_not_override_ie_key_in_url_transparent" defines a series of custom InfoExtractors and attempts to call the extract_info method on the YDL object to extract information based on a fake URL with the purpose of checking whether the 'ie_key' attribute is correctly preserved across the extraction process.

The test fails when asserting the value of the 'id' field in the downloaded dictionary. The expected value is 'testid', but the actual value is 'foo1_id', indicating that the 'id' field is not being correctly updated during the extraction process.

Upon examining the provided buggy function "process_ie_result", it is observed that the 'id' field is not being updated. The extraction process modifies the 'ie_result' dictionary by adding additional information without updating the 'id' field, leading to the discrepancy observed in the test result.

To fix this issue, the 'id' field needs to be updated during the extraction process to ensure that it reflects the correct value. This can be achieved by modifying the 'process_ie_result' function to update the 'id' field along with the other additional information.

The corrected code for the "process_ie_result" function is provided below:

```python
def process_ie_result(self, ie_result, download=True, extra_info={}):
    result_type = ie_result.get('_type', 'video')

    if result_type in ('url_transparent', 'url'):
        # ... omitted code ...

        # Update the id field if applicable
        if 'id' in ie_result and 'id' in force_properties:
            ie_result['id'] = force_properties['id']

        return ie_result
    # ... omitted code ...
```

In the modified code, the 'id' field is checked for existence in both the 'ie_result' and 'force_properties', and if present in both, it is updated with the value from 'force_properties'.

This correction ensures that the 'id' field is correctly updated during the extraction process, resolving the discrepancy observed in the test case.
