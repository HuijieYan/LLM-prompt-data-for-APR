The issue description is:

The 'chapters' value from the JSON (-J parameter), is usually present on some video. But since a few days, it is not available in ANY video. My guess is that's since the new chapter UI of youtube.

Here's a verbose excerpt from youtube version 23.04.2020, not that it looks very useful
