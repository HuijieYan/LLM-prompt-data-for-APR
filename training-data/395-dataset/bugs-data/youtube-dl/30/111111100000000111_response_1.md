The problem in the provided function `build_format_selector` is likely due to the missing import of the `collections` module. The `collections` module is used to define the `namedtuple` for `FormatSelector`, and the code references `collections.namedtuple`, but the module is not imported anywhere in the code.

To fix this bug, the `collections` module needs to be imported at the beginning of the file.

Here's the corrected code for the `build_format_selector` function with the addition of `'collections'` import:

```python
import collections  # Add this import at the beginning of the file

class YoutubeDL(object):
    # ... (other code)

    def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
        def syntax_error(note, start):
            message = (
                'Invalid format specification: '
                '{0}\n\t{1}\n\t{2}^'.format(note, format_spec, ' ' * start[1]))
            return SyntaxError(message)

        PICKFIRST = 'PICKFIRST'
        MERGE = 'MERGE'
        SINGLE = 'SINGLE'
        GROUP = 'GROUP'
        FormatSelector = collections.namedtuple('FormatSelector', ['type', 'selector', 'filters'])

        # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With the addition of the `collections` import, the `namedtuple` for `FormatSelector` will be correctly defined, and the `build_format_selector` function should work as expected.
