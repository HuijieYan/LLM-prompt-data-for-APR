It seems that the issue is occurring when trying to access an index in the `formats` list in the function `selector_function`. Based on the error message, it's clear that the list `formats` is empty, and that's why the index is out of range.

The reason behind this bug could be related to the implementation of the logic for selecting the best or worst formats based on conditions like whether they contain video or audio codecs.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to add checks to ensure that the `formats` list is not empty before attempting to access its elements. Additionally, the logic for selecting the best or worst formats based on video and audio codecs should be revisited to ensure it handles edge cases and unexpected data correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    import collections
    import io
    import tokenize

    # ... (previous code remains unchanged)

    def selector_function(formats):
        if format_spec == 'all':
            for f in formats:
                yield f
        elif format_spec in ['best', 'worst', None]:
            if formats:
                format_idx = 0 if format_spec == 'worst' else -1
                audiovideo_formats = [
                    f for f in formats
                    if f.get('vcodec') != 'none' and f.get('acodec') != 'none']
                if audiovideo_formats:
                    yield audiovideo_formats[format_idx]
                else:
                    # Handle audio only (soundcloud) or video only (imgur) URLs
                    if all(f.get('acodec') != 'none' for f in formats):
                        # Select the best/worst audio format
                        yield sorted(formats, key=lambda x: x['filesize'])[format_idx]
                    elif all(f.get('vcodec') != 'none' for f in formats):
                        # Select the best/worst video format
                        yield sorted(formats, key=lambda x: x['filesize'])[format_idx]
            else:
                raise ValueError('The formats list is empty')
        # ... (other conditions and logic for format_spec)
                
    # ... (remaining code remains unchanged)

    return _build_selector_function(parsed_selector)
```
