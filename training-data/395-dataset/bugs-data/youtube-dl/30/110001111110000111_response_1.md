The error message is indicating an "IndexError: list index out of range" within the `selector_function` when trying to yield the format at index `format_idx` from the `formats` list. This is likely occurring due to the `formats` list being empty.

The issue seems to be related to the format selection logic and syntax in the `build_format_selector` function. The function is responsible for selecting the best format based on various criteria.

The potential error location is within the `selector_function` where it tries to yield the format at index `format_idx` from the `formats` list. The error indicates that the list index is out of range, which means the `formats` list is empty and does not have the expected format information.

To fix this bug, the `selector_function` should be modified to handle the case when the `formats` list is empty. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the logic for selecting the best format based on different criteria is correctly implemented.

Here's the corrected code for the `build_format_selector` function:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    def selector_function(formats):
        if not formats:
            return []

        # Existing logic for selecting the best format

    # ... (other code remains unchanged)
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the `formats` list is empty, and if it is, we simply return an empty list. This ensures that the `selector_function` handles the case when there are no formats available.

This fix will prevent the "IndexError: list index out of range" by handling the empty `formats` list case within the `selector_function`. Additionally, it's important to review the entire logic of the format selection and ensure it aligns with the requirements and use cases provided in the GitHub issue description.
