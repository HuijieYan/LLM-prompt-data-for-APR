The error message indicates that the 'formats' list is empty when the 'selector_function' is called, resulting in an IndexError due to an attempt to access an index in an empty list.

The potential error location within the 'build_format_selector' function is the 'selector_function' that attempts to yield a format from the 'formats' list without checking if the list is empty.

The bug occurs because the 'selector_function' is not handling the case where the 'formats' list is empty, leading to an IndexError when trying to access an index in an empty list. This could happen if the input 'format_spec' does not match any of the specified conditions.

To fix this bug, we need to add a condition to check if the 'formats' list is empty before attempting to yield a format. If the 'formats' list is empty, we should handle this case appropriately, such as returning an empty list or raising an exception to indicate the absence of formats matching the conditions.

Here's the corrected code for the 'build_format_selector' function:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # ... (existing code)

    def selector_function(formats):
        if not formats:
            return []  # Return an empty list if formats is empty
        # Existing code for format selection
        # ...
    # ... (remaining code)
    return selector_function
```

In the corrected code, we added a check for an empty 'formats' list at the beginning of the 'selector_function'. If 'formats' is empty, it returns an empty list. This change ensures that the 'selector_function' handles the case of an empty 'formats' list, preventing the IndexError from occurring.
