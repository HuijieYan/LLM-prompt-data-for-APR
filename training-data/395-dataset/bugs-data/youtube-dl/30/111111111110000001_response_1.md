The error occurs in the `selector_function` in the `build_format_selector` method of the `YoutubeDL` class. The error `IndexError: list index out of range` is caused by trying to access an index in the `formats` list that does not exist.

The reason behind this error is that the code does not handle the case where no formats are present in the `formats` list. When the `format_selector` function is called with an empty `formats` list, it tries to access an index (`format_idx`) that does not exist, resulting in the `IndexError`.

To fix this, we need to handle the case where the `formats` list is empty and return an appropriate value or raise an exception to indicate that there are no formats to select from.

Here's the corrected code for the `build_format_selector` method:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # ... (previous code) ...

    def selector_function(formats):
        if not formats:
            raise ValueError('No formats available for selection')
        
        if format_spec == 'all':
            for f in formats:
                yield f
        # other conditions and selections go here

    # ... (remaining code) ...
```

In the corrected code, we added a check for the `formats` list at the beginning of the `selector_function` and raised a `ValueError` if there are no formats available for selection. This will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring and provide a clear indication that there are no formats to select from.
