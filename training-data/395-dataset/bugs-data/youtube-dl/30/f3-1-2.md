This is a combination of three similar feature requests, all aimed at improving the ability to specify the particular format(s) chosen by youtube-dl.

I want an operator that says “choose the better of the two”. For a motivating use case, non-DASH formats are better than (equivalent) DASH formats when used in mpv (eg. allows seeking and accurate duration information) as well as standalone (they can be streamed instantly, rather than needing to wait for both components to finish downloading before remuxing them). The syntax I imagine could be something like this: best|bestvideo+bestaudio. It would pick the one with highest overall quality, preferring the leftmost if they're identical. (Ideally there should also be some slight tolerance for considering formats “equal”)
I want to be able to set my heuristics for audio and video tracks independently. The way I imagine this working is by being able to “group” together a format selection using parentheses, like this: (bestvideo[tbr<13000][height>720]/bestvideo[tbr<13000][fps>30])+(bestaudio[ext=webm]/bestaudio)
The “quality” assessment should be multiplied by a format-specific weight, since eg. 128 kbps Opus is definitely better than 128 kbps MP3, and eg. 21 Mbps VP9 ought to be better than 22 Mbps AVC. This should probably be user-configurable, and would coincidentally allow me to easily “prefer free formats” by giving them (significantly) higher weights than corresponding non-free formats.
