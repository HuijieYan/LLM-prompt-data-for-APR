The test case `test_format_filtering` is trying to test different types of format selectors by creating a YoutubeDL object `ydl` with specific format specifications and calling the `process_ie_result` method. The error occurs when the test case tries to process the IE result using the `process_ie_result` method.

The error message indicates that the issue is occurring in the `selector_function` within the `build_format_selector` method of the `YoutubeDL` class. It specifically mentions an `IndexError` with the message "list index out of range."

The potential error location is within the logic of the `selector_function`, where there is a conditional yielding of a format based on its index (`format_idx`).

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the logic for selecting the audio/video formats based on specific conditions is leading to an attempt to access an index that is out of the range of the `formats` list, resulting in the `IndexError`.

To fix the bug, the conditional logic within the `selector_function` needs to be modified to handle cases where the index might be out of range.

Here's the corrected code for the `build_format_selector` method of the `YoutubeDL` class:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # ... (other existing code) ...

    def selector_function(formats):
        if format_spec == 'all':
            for f in formats:
                yield f
        elif format_spec in ['best', 'worst', None]:
            if not formats:
                return
            format_idx = 0 if format_spec == 'worst' else -1
            audiovideo_formats = [f for f in formats if f.get('vcodec') != 'none' and f.get('acodec') != 'none']
            if audiovideo_formats:
                yield audiovideo_formats[format_idx]
            # for audio only (soundcloud) or video only (imgur) urls, select the best/worst audio format
            elif all(f.get('acodec') != 'none' for f in formats) or all(f.get('vcodec') != 'none' for f in formats):
                if len(formats) > abs(format_idx):
                    yield formats[format_idx]

    # ... (other existing code) ...
```

In the corrected code, additional checks have been added to ensure that the index access is within the range of the `formats` list.
