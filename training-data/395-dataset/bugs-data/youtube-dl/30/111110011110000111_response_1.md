The error seems to be caused by an IndexError: list index out of range within the 'selector_function' in the 'build_format_selector' method of the YoutubeDL class. The error occurs when the code tries to yield formats[format_idx] with an empty 'formats' list.

The issue seems to be related to the implementation of the format selection logic, specifically in the 'selector_function', where the program attempts to yield a format based on certain criteria, but it does not handle the case where the 'formats' list is empty.

To fix this issue, the 'selector_function' should handle the case where the 'formats' list is empty. This can be achieved by adding a check to ensure that the 'formats' list is not empty before attempting to yield a format.

Here is the corrected code for the 'build_format_selector' method of the YoutubeDL class:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
        # ... other code ...

        def selector_function(formats):
            if not formats:  # Check if the formats list is empty
                return  # Return if the formats list is empty

            # Rest of the code for the selector_function...

        # ... other code ...
```

In this corrected code, we added a check at the beginning of the 'selector_function' to ensure that the 'formats' list is not empty before proceeding with the format selection logic. If the 'formats' list is empty, the function simply returns, preventing the IndexError from occurring.

By including this check, the 'selector_function' is now able to handle the case where the 'formats' list is empty, thus addressing the bug and preventing the IndexError from being raised.
