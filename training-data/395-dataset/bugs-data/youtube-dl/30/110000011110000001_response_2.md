The test case 'test_format_filtering' utilizes a series of format selection operations and checks the expected format_id against the actual result after processing the extraction result with the given format selection. The error occurs during the 'ydl.process_ie_result(info_dict)' call inside the test function.

The potential error location within the 'build_format_selector' function is likely in the 'selector_function' where the 'formats' list is being accessed. The error 'IndexError: list index out of range' suggests that there is an attempt to access an element from an empty list.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely the 'formats' list being empty when it should contain the extracted formats from the 'info_dict'. This could be due to a problem in the parsing or processing of the format selection criteria.

To fix the bug, the 'formats' list needs to be populated with the actual extracted formats before being used in the 'selector_function'. Additionally, the parsing and processing of the format selection criteria should be thoroughly checked to ensure correctness.

The corrected code for the 'build_format_selector' function:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # existing code, unchanged
    ...

    def _parse_format_selection(tokens, inside_merge=False, inside_choice=False, inside_group=False):
        # existing code, unchanged
        ...

    def _build_selector_function(selector):
        # existing code, unchanged
        ...

    stream = io.BytesIO(format_spec.encode('utf-8'))
    try:
        tokens = list(compat_tokenize_tokenize(stream.readline))
    except tokenize.TokenError:
        raise syntax_error('Missing closing/opening brackets or parenthesis', (0, len(format_spec)))

    class TokenIterator(object):
        # existing code, unchanged
        ...

    parsed_selector = _parse_format_selection(iter(TokenIterator(tokens)))

    def final_selector(formats):
        for _filter in filters:
            formats = list(filter(_filter, formats))
        return _build_selector_function(parsed_selector)(formats)

    return final_selector
```

With these corrections, the function should now properly parse the format selection criteria and apply it to the provided formats, addressing the bug that caused the IndexError.
