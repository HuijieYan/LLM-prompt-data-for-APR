The potential error in the build_format_selector function is in the definition of the syntax_error and _parse_format_selection functions. 

When the syntax_error function is called, it returns a SyntaxError but the program does not handle it at the point where it is raised.

To fix the bug, we can add a try-except block in the build_format_selector function to catch the SyntaxError and handle it appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the build_format_selector function:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    def syntax_error(note, start):
        message = (
            'Invalid format specification: '
            '{0}\n\t{1}\n\t{2}^'.format(note, format_spec, ' ' * start[1]))
        raise SyntaxError(message)

    PICKFIRST = 'PICKFIRST'
    MERGE = 'MERGE'
    SINGLE = 'SINGLE'
    GROUP = 'GROUP'
    FormatSelector = collections.namedtuple('FormatSelector', ['type', 'selector', 'filters'])

    # rest of the function implementation remains the same
    # ...
```

By raising the SyntaxError in the syntax_error function and not catching it within the build_format_selector function, we allow the calling context to handle the error as needed.
