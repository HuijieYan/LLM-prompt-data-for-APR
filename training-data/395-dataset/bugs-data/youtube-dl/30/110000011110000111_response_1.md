The error occurs in the `selector_function` within the `build_format_selector` method. The error message indicates that there is an `IndexError` because the `formats` list is empty, and an attempt to access an index within an empty list is made. This suggests that the issue lies in how the `formats` list is being processed in the `selector_function` when yielding the format.

The reason behind the bug is that the logic in the `selector_function` does not handle the case where the `formats` list is empty, leading to the `IndexError`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `selector_function` to check if the `formats` list is empty before attempting to yield any format. We can add a simple conditional statement to handle this scenario.

Here's the corrected code for the `build_format_selector` method:

```python
import collections
import io
import itertools
import tokenize

def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # previous code remains the same
    
    def selector_function(formats):
        if not formats:
            return  # If formats list is empty, return without yielding any format
        if format_spec == 'all':
            for f in formats:
                yield f
        # rest of the function remains the same

    # rest of the code remains the same
```

In this corrected code, a check is added at the beginning of the `selector_function` to return without yielding any format if the `formats` list is empty. This prevents the `IndexError` from occurring.
