The code provided seems to be very complex and requires a comprehensive understanding of the entire YoutubeDL class and its methods to identify the potential issues accurately. However, based on the code and the description provided, it seems that the `build_format_selector` function has an issue with the `syntax_error` function and its usage.

The error message is creating a new instance of SyntaxError and returning it, which is not a valid approach. The corrected code for the problematic function should be to return the error message directly instead of creating a new instance of SyntaxError.

Below is the corrected code for the `build_format_selector` function:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    def syntax_error(note, start):
        message = (
            'Invalid format specification: '
            '{0}\n\t{1}\n\t{2}^'.format(note, format_spec, ' ' * start[1]))
        return message
    
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

This corrected code eliminates the attempt to create a new instance of the `SyntaxError` and directly returns the error message.
