The error message indicates an "IndexError" at line 1021 in the "selector_function" of the "build_format_selector" method in the "YoutubeDL" class. This error occurs due to an empty "formats" list being iterated, leading to a list index out of range error.

The reason for the bug is that the "selector_function" is not handling the case when the "formats" list is empty, which results in the IndexError. This can happen when the format selection logic does not match any available formats, leading to an empty list.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when the "formats" list is empty and return an appropriate response, such as an empty list or a default format. Additionally, we should ensure that the format selection logic covers all possible scenarios to avoid the IndexError.

Here's the corrected code for the "build_format_selector" method:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # ... (previous code) ...

    def selector_function(formats):
        if not formats:
            return []  # Return an empty list when formats is empty
        # Existing selector_function logic
        # ...
    
    # ... (remaining code) ...
```

In the "selector_function", we added a check for an empty "formats" list to return an empty list, thereby preventing the IndexError. This ensures that the function handles the edge case when no formats are available for selection.
