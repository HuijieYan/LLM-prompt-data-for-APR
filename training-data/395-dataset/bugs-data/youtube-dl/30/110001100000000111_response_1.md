The potential error in the `build_format_selector` function is the `syntax_error` function, which is defined within the scope of the `build_format_selector` function and not utilized properly.

The buggy function is attempting to create a `SyntaxError` and return it from the `syntax_error` function. However, the `SyntaxError` exception is not being raised properly, and the `SyntaxError` is not being utilized correctly.

To fix the bug, the `syntax_error` function should be properly implemented to raise the `SyntaxError` exception with the appropriate message. Additionally, the return type of this function should be `None` since it's intended to raise an exception.

Here's the corrected code for the `build_format_selector` function:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    PICKFIRST = 'PICKFIRST'
    MERGE = 'MERGE'
    SINGLE = 'SINGLE'
    GROUP = 'GROUP'
    FormatSelector = collections.namedtuple('FormatSelector', ['type', 'selector', 'filters'])

    def syntax_error(note, start):
        message = (
            'Invalid format specification: '
            '{0}\n\t{1}\n\t{2}^'.format(note, format_spec, ' ' * start[1]))
        raise SyntaxError(message)

    # ... (other code remains unchanged) ...
```
