The error message indicates that there is an IndexError when trying to access an element in the 'formats' list. This occurs in the 'selector_function' within the 'build_format_selector' function of the YoutubeDL class.

The bug seems to be caused by an issue in the logic for selecting formats based on format specifications. The 'format_idx' variable is calculated based on the format specification ('best' or 'worst'), and then used to access the formats list, but this is leading to an IndexError because the 'formats' list is empty.

To fix this bug, you should first check if the 'formats' list is empty before trying to access its elements based on the 'format_idx' index.

Here's the corrected code for the 'build_format_selector' function:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # ...existing code...

    def selector_function(formats):
        if not formats:
            return
        if format_spec == 'all':
            for f in formats:
                yield f
        elif format_spec in ['best', 'worst', None]:
            format_idx = 0 if format_spec == 'worst' else -1
            audiovideo_formats = [
                f for f in formats
                if f.get('vcodec') != 'none' and f.get('acodec') != 'none']
            if audiovideo_formats:
                yield audiovideo_formats[format_idx]
            # for audio-only (soundcloud) or video-only (imgur) URLs, select the best/worst audio format
            elif (all(f.get('acodec') != 'none' for f in formats) or
                  all(f.get('vcodec') != 'none' for f in formats)):
                yield formats[format_idx]
        # ...other cases...
    
    # ...remaining code...
```

In this corrected code, we added a check at the beginning of the 'selector_function' to return early if the 'formats' list is empty. This should prevent the IndexError from occurring.
