Potential error location: 
The potential error in the given code is that the function `build_format_selector` is missing the import statement for the `collections` module. 

Reason behind the bug:
The 'collections' module is being used to create a namedtuple, but it has not been imported at the beginning of the code, causing the function to fail.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Import the 'collections' module at the beginning of the code to resolve the issue.

Corrected code:
```python
# corrected function with the import statement added
import collections
import io
import itertools
import tokenize
import os
import sys

def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    def syntax_error(note, start):
        message = (
            'Invalid format specification: '
            '{0}\n\t{1}\n\t{2}^'.format(note, format_spec, ' ' * start[1]))
        return SyntaxError(message)

    PICKFIRST = 'PICKFIRST'
    MERGE = 'MERGE'
    SINGLE = 'SINGLE'
    GROUP = 'GROUP'
    FormatSelector = collections.namedtuple('FormatSelector', ['type', 'selector', 'filters'])

    # rest of the code remains unchanged
```
