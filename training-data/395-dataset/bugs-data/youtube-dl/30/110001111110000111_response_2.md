The error occurs when the `selector_function` is trying to yield a format from an empty `formats` list, leading to an `IndexError`. This occurs because no formats are being passed to the `selector_function` when it is called.

To fix the bug, the function should be called with the `formats` argument containing a list of format items. This list should be passed down from the outer function calls.

One approach to fixing the bug is to modify the test case in `test_format_filtering` to ensure that the `formats` list is properly passed to the `selector_function`.

Here's the corrected code for the `build_format_selector` function:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # ... (omitted code)

    def selector_function(formats):
        if format_spec == 'all':
            for f in formats:
                yield f
        # rest of the conditions and logic as before

    # ... (omitted code)
```
