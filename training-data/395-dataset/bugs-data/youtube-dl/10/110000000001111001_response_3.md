The `js_to_json` function seems to be converting JavaScript code to JSON format. However, there are several issues with the regular expressions and the `fix_kv` function.

The bug is occurring in the `fix_kv` function, particularly in the handling of the single quotes and the escaping of characters. The current code does not handle the single quotes and the escape sequences properly, causing issues with the overall parsing.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `fix_kv` function to properly handle the single quotes and the escape sequences. Additionally, we need to update the regular expression patterns to ensure correct parsing of the input JavaScript code.

Here's the corrected code for the `js_to_json` function:

```python
import re

def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
            return v
        if v.startswith('"') or v.startswith("'"):
            v = v.replace("\\\\", "\\\\\\").replace("\\'", "\\'").replace('\\"', "\\\"")
            return '"' + v[1:-1] + '"'
        return '"%s"' % v

    res = re.sub(r'''(?x)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\")?)*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\')?)*'|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*
        ''', fix_kv, code)
    res = re.sub(r',(\s*\])', lambda m: m.group(1), res)
    return res
```

With the corrected code, the `fix_kv` function properly handles the single quotes and escape sequences. Additionally, the regular expression pattern has been updated to ensure correct parsing of the input JavaScript code.
