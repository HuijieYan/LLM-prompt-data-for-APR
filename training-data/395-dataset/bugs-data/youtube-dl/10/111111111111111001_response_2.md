The problem is occurring because the buggy function `js_to_json` is not handling the variations in the code properly. The regular expressions and substitution logic inside the function are not covering all possible cases, leading to incorrect results and causing the test to fail.

To fix this issue, we need to update the regular expressions and the `fix_kv` function that is used for substitution. This will help in correctly identifying different types of values and processing them accordingly.

Here's the corrected version of the `js_to_json` function:

```python
import re

def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
            return v
        if v.startswith('"'):
            return v
        if v.startswith("'"):
            v = v[1:-1]
            v = re.sub(r"\\\\|\\'|\"", lambda m: {
                '\\\\': '\\\\',
                "\\'": "'",
                '"': '\\"',
            }[m.group(0)], v)
            return f'"{v}"'
        return f'"{v}"'  # Replace with double quotes in other cases
    
    res = re.sub(r'''(?x)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\")?)*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\')?)*'|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*
        ''', fix_kv, code)
    res = re.sub(r',\s*(\])', r'\1', res)  # Correcting the pattern for replacement
    return res
```

With these changes, the function should be able to correctly handle different types of values and process them as expected. This should resolve the error and make the test cases pass.
