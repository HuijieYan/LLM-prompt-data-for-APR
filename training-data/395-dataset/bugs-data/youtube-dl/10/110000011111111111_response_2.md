The error message is a JSONDecodeError with the message "Extra data: line 1 column 3 (char 2)". This indicates that there is an issue with the JSON data created from `js_to_json` function. The test cases are trying to compare the JSON data produced by `js_to_json` with the expected JSON data string. The mismatch between the JSON data produced by `js_to_json` and the expected JSON data string is causing the error.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `fix_kv` function, which is used to transform key-value pairs from custom JavaScript format to valid JSON format.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be that the `fix_kv` function is not correctly handling the replacement of key-value pairs and is producing invalid JSON data.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to review the `fix_kv` function and ensure that it correctly identifies and transforms key-value pairs to valid JSON format.

Here's the corrected code for the `js_to_json` function:

```python
import re

def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
            return v
        if v.startswith('"'):
            return v
        if v.startswith("'"):
            v = v[1:-1]
            v = re.sub(r"\\\\|\\'|\"", lambda m: {
                '\\\\': '\\\\',
                "\\'": "'",
                '"': '\\"',
            }[m.group(0)], v)
            return '"%s"' % v
        return v

    res = re.sub(r'''(?x)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\")?)*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\')?)*'|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*
        ''', fix_kv, code)
    res = re.sub(r',(\s*\])', lambda m: m.group(1), res)
    return res
```

The changes made include the modification of the `fix_kv` function to ensure that key-value pairs are correctly transformed to valid JSON format. With these modifications, the `js_to_json` function should produce valid JSON data, resolving the JSONDecodeError in the test function.
