The error message provided indicates that there is an issue with the JSON decoding, specifically the "Extra data" error. This means that the input string being passed to `json.loads()` contains extra data that is preventing it from being parsed correctly.

Upon analyzing the provided buggy function `js_to_json`, it seems that it is not properly converting the input JavaScript object to a valid JSON string. In particular, the `fix_kv` function inside `js_to_json` does not seem to be properly handling single-quoted keys and values.

The reason behind the bug is that the `fix_kv` function is not correctly handling the single-quoted keys and values in the input JavaScript object. This leads to the generation of an invalid JSON string, which causes the error when it is passed to `json.loads()`.

To resolve the bug, we need to ensure that the `fix_kv` function correctly handles the conversion of both single- and double-quoted keys and values in the input JavaScript object.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic `js_to_json` function:

```python
import re

def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
            return v
        if v.startswith('"') or v.startswith("'"):  # added condition to handle both single and double quotes
            v = v[1:-1]
            v = re.sub(r'\\["\'\\]', lambda m: {
                '\\': '\\\\',
                "'": "\\'",
                '"': '\\"',
            }[m.group(0)], v)
            return f'"{v}"'
        return v
    
    res = re.sub(r'''(?x)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\")?)*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\')?)*'|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*
        ''', fix_kv, code)
    res = re.sub(r',(\s*\])', lambda m: m.group(1), res)
    return res
```

With this corrected code, the `js_to_json` function should now be able to correctly convert the JavaScript object to a valid JSON string, resolving the issue with the test case provided.
