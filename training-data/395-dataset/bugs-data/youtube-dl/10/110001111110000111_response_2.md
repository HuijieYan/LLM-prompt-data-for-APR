The error message indicates that there is a JSON decoding error due to extra data. This suggests that the function `js_to_json` is not correctly converting the input to a valid JSON format, which is causing the JSON decoding error.

The potential error location is likely in the `js_to_json` function, specifically in the implementation of the regular expressions and the `fix_kv` function.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `fix_kv` function is not handling the input correctly, leading to an incorrect conversion from JavaScript to JSON format.

To fix the bug, the `fix_kv` function should be modified to correctly handle the conversion from JavaScript to JSON. Additionally, the regular expressions used for matching and substitution should be adjusted to ensure that the conversion is performed accurately.

Here is the corrected code for the `js_to_json` function:

```python
import re
import json

# corrected js_to_json function
def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
            return v
        if v.startswith('"'):
            return v
        if v.startswith("'"):
            v = v[1:-1]
            v = re.sub(r"\\\\|\\'|\"", lambda m: {
                '\\\\': '\\\\',
                "\\'": "'",
                '"': '\\"',
            }[m.group(0)], v)
        return '"%s"' % v

    res = re.sub(r'''['"](.*?)['"]''', lambda m: '"' + m.group(1) + '"', code)
    res = re.sub(r'\'', '"', res)
    res = re.sub(r'(?<={|,)\s*[^:]+(?=:)', lambda m: '"' + m.group(0) + '"', res)
    return res
```

In the corrected `js_to_json` function, we have modified the regular expressions and the `fix_kv` function to properly handle the conversion from JavaScript to JSON. This should address the bug and ensure that the input is correctly converted to valid JSON format.
