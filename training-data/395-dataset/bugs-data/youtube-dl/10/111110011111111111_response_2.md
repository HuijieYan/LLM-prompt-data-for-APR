The bug occurs in the `fix_kv` function, which is supposed to fix key-value pairs in the input JavaScript code into JSON format. The bug is causing the function to not properly handle the conversion of single quoted keys and values into their double quoted counterparts.

The bug occurs because the regular expression used in the `fix_kv` function is not handling single quoted keys and values properly, and the replacement function for those keys and values is missing.

To fix this bug, you could modify the `fix_kv` function to properly handle single quoted keys and values, by adding a new regular expression and a replacement lambda function for single quoted keys and values. Here's the corrected code for the `fix_kv` function and the `js_to_json` function:

```python
import re

def fix_kv(m):
    v = m.group(0)
    if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
        return v
    if v.startswith('"'):
        return v
    if v.startswith("'"):
        v = v[1:-1]
        v = re.sub(r"\\\\|\\'|\"", lambda m: {
            '\\\\': '\\\\',
            "\\'": "'",
            '"': '\\"',
        }[m.group(0)], v)
        return '"%s"' % v
    return '"%s"' % v

def js_to_json(code):
    res = re.sub(r'''(?x)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\")?)*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\')?)*'|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*
        ''', fix_kv, code)
    res = re.sub(r',(\s*\])', lambda m: m.group(1), res)
    return res
```

With this corrected implementation, the `fix_kv` function should properly handle the conversion of both single and double quoted keys and values into their JSON counterparts. After making these changes, the `test_js_to_json_realworld` function should no longer raise the `JSONDecodeError` during the assertion test.
