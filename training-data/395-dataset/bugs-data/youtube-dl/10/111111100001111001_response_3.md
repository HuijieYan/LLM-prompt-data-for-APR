The issue with the `js_to_json` function is that the `fix_kv` function is nested inside it, but `re` from the `import re` statement has not been called. 

To fix this issue, we need to move the `fix_kv` function outside of the `js_to_json` function and import the `re` module at the beginning of the file.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/youtube-dl_10/youtube_dl/utils.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def fix_kv(m):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def js_to_json(code):
    res = re.sub(r'''(?x)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\")?)*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\')?)*'|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*
        ''', fix_kv, code)
    res = re.sub(r',(\s*\])', lambda m: m.group(1), res)
    return res
```
