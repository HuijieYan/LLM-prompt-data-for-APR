The error message is showing a `json.decoder.JSONDecodeError: Extra data` when trying to load the JSON code generated by the `js_to_json` function and compare it with the original JSON input represented as a string. 

The potential error location within the `js_to_json` function is likely related to how it handles escaping characters and converts single quotes to double quotes.

The bug is occurring because the function doesn't properly handle escaping and conversion of single quotes to double quotes. As a result, the JSON code generated by the function contains incorrect syntax that leads to the error when trying to load it using `json.loads`.

To fix the bug, a new approach is needed to properly handle escaping and conversion of single quotes to double quotes in the input code.

Here's the corrected code for the `js_to_json` function:

```python
import re

def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_quoted(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v.startswith('"'):
            return v
        if v.startswith("'"):
            v = v[1:-1]
            v = re.sub(r'\\[\\\'"]', lambda match: {
                '\\\\': '\\\\',
                "\\'": "'",
                '\\"': '"'
            }[match.group(0)], v)
            v = re.sub(r'\\\\u', '\\u', v)
        return '"%s"' % v

    res = re.sub(r'''(?x)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\")?)*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\')?)*'|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*
        ''', fix_quoted, code)
    res = re.sub(r',(\s*[\]}])', lambda m: m.group(1), res)
    return res
```

This corrected function fixes the capturing of quoted characters and properly handles escaping and conversion of single quotes to double quotes. After applying these fixes, the function should generate valid JSON code that can be successfully loaded using `json.loads`.
