The error message indicates that there is a problem with the JSON formatting and decoding. The issue seems to be with the single quotes in the input that are not being properly converted to double quotes.

The potential error location is within the `fix_kv` function, where the single quotes are not being handled correctly.

The bug occurs because the regular expression in the `fix_kv` function does not properly handle single quotes. This leads to issues with the JSON formatting and decoding.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `fix_kv` function to properly handle single quotes and convert them to double quotes.

Here's the corrected code for the `js_to_json` function:

```python
import re
import json

def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
            return v
        if v.startswith('"'):
            return v
        if v.startswith("'"):
            v = v[1:-1]
            v = re.sub(r"\\\\|\\'|\"", lambda m: {
                '\\\\': '\\\\',
                "\\'": "'",
                '"': '\\"',
            }[m.group(0)], v)
            return '"%s"' % v
        return '"%s"' % v

    res = re.sub(r'''(?x)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\")?)*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\')?)*'|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*
        ''', fix_kv, code)
    res = re.sub(r',(\s*[\]}])', lambda m: m.group(1), res)
    return res
```

This corrected code properly handles the single quotes, converts them to double quotes and ensures correct JSON formatting.
