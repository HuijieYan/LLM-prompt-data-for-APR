Potential Error Location:
The bug is likely occurring in the fix_kv function, where it's trying to replace certain characters in the string.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug is likely due to the fact that the fix_kv function is not handling all cases properly. It may be missing some character replacements or not handling certain situations correctly.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Add additional checks and replacements to the fix_kv function to ensure all cases are handled properly.
2. Use regular expressions to handle the character replacements more effectively.

Corrected Code:
```python
import re

def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
            return v
        if v.startswith('"'):
            return v
        if v.startswith("'"):
            v = v[1:-1]
            v = re.sub(r"\\\\|\\'|\"", lambda m: {
                '\\\\': '\\\\',
                "\\'": "'",
                '"': '\\"',
            }[m.group(0)], v)
        return '"%s"' % v

    res = re.sub(r'''(?x)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\")?)*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\')?)*'|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*\b
        ''', fix_kv, code)
    res = re.sub(r',(\s*\])', lambda m: m.group(1), res)
    return res
```
