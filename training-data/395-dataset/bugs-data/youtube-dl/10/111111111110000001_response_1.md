The error message indicates a problem in the implementation of the `js_to_json` function, particularly in the regular expression used to match different parts of the JavaScript code.

The potential error location within the `js_to_json` function is the regular expression used to match different parts of the JavaScript code. Specifically, the error message suggests that there is "Extra data" present in the JSON being processed, which indicates that the regular expression may not be correctly capturing the JavaScript code.

The bug is occurring because the regular expression in the `js_to_json` function is not properly capturing the different parts of the JavaScript code, resulting in incorrect JSON conversion.

To fix the bug, the regular expression in the `js_to_json` function needs to be updated to correctly capture different parts of the JavaScript code.

Here's the corrected code for the `js_to_json` function:

```python
import re
import json

def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
            return v
        if v.startswith('"'):
            return v
        if v.startswith("'"):
            v = v[1:-1]
            v = re.sub(r"\\\\|\\'|\"", lambda m: {
                '\\\\': '\\\\',
                "\\'": "'",
                '"': '\\"',
            }[m.group(0)], v)
        return '"%s"' % v

    res = re.sub(r'''(?x)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\")?)*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\')?)*'|
        [\w.-]+
        ''', fix_kv, code)
    res = re.sub(r',(\s*\])', lambda m: m.group(1), res)
    return res
```

With this corrected function, the regular expression has been updated to correctly capture different parts of the JavaScript code, and the bug causing the JSON conversion error should be resolved.
