The error message indicates that there is an issue when trying to load the JSON generated by the `js_to_json` function. The error is specifically "Extra data: line 1 column 3 (char 2)", which indicates that there is some extra or unexpected data present in the string.

Upon reviewing the `js_to_json` function, it seems that the bug might stem from how the function handles single quoted strings. The regular expression being used in the `fix_kv` function to identify strings might not be accurate.

The issue arises when the input string contains single quotes within a larger double-quoted string. This causes the regular expression to match and treat the inner single-quoted string as a separate value, leading to incorrect conversion to JSON.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the regular expression to properly handle single and double-quoted strings within the input code.

Here's the corrected code for the `js_to_json` function:

```python
import re
import json

def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
            return v
        if v.startswith('"'):
            return v
        if v.startswith("'"):
            v = v[1:-1]
            v = re.sub(r"\\\\|\\'|\"", lambda m: {
                '\\\\': '\\\\',
                "\\'": "'",
                '"': '\\"'
            }[m.group(0)], v)
        return '"%s"' % v

    # Corrected regular expression to handle single and double-quoted strings
    res = re.sub(r'''("[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\")*")|('[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\')*')|([a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*)''', fix_kv, code)
    res = re.sub(r',(\s*\])', lambda m: m.group(1), res)
    return res
```

The corrected regular expression should properly handle single and double-quoted strings within the input code, preventing the incorrect conversion to JSON.
