The issue with the `js_to_json` function is related to the regular expressions used to handle JavaScript-like snippets and convert them to valid JSON. The `fix_kv` function does not handle cases properly when the JavaScript strings contain special characters.

The potential error location within the function is the `fix_kv` function, specifically in the part where it handles the conversion of strings. The code currently lacks proper handling of escape sequences and special characters in JavaScript strings.

The error message from the test function indicates that the problem arises when trying to load the JSON after the transformation due to extra data, likely caused by incorrect string parsing.

To fix this bug, the `re` module's `sub` method can be improved to correctly handle escape sequences and special characters in JavaScript strings.

Here's the corrected code for the `js_to_json` function:

```python
import re

def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
            return v
        if v.startswith('"'):
            return v
        if v.startswith("'"):
            v = v[1:-1]
            v = v.replace(r'\\', r'\\\\')  # handle double backslashes
            v = v.replace(r'\"', r'\\"')   # handle escaped double quotes
            v = v.replace(r"\'", r"\\'")   # handle escaped single quotes
            return f'"{v}"'
        return '"%s"' % v

    res = re.sub(r'''(?x)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\")?)*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\')?)*'|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*
        ''', fix_kv, code)
    res = re.sub(r',(\s*\])', lambda m: m.group(1), res)
    return res
```

This corrected code improves the `fix_kv` function to properly handle escape sequences and special characters in JavaScript strings using the `replace` method. This should resolve the extra data issue encountered when trying to load the JSON after transformation.
