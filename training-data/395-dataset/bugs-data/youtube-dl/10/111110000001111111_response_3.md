The issue with the `js_to_json` function is that it is not correctly parsing the input JSON-like string. It is not handling escaping properly, and it is not identifying the key-value pairs. The `fix_kv` function inside `js_to_json` is responsible for processing the matched keys and values, but there are issues with its implementation.

The reason behind the bug is that the `fix_kv` function is not correctly handling the quotes and escaping within the key-value pairs. It also fails to recognize the key-value pairs and simply returns the entire substring matched by the regular expression.

To fix the bug, the `fix_kv` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the key-value pairs, including proper handling of quoting and escaping. Additionally, the regular expression used to match key-value pairs needs to be adjusted to correctly identify them.

Here's the corrected code for the `js_to_json` function:

```python
import re

def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        key_value = m.group(0)
        if ':' in key_value:
            key, value = key_value.split(':')
            return '"%s":%s' % (key.strip(), value.strip())
        return key_value
    
    res = re.sub(r'''(?x)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\")?)*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\')?)*'|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*
        ''', fix_kv, code)
    
    return res
```

This corrected function includes a new `fix_kv` function that correctly handles the key-value pairs and the regular expression also correctly identifies the key-value pairs. This should resolve the issues with the original function and produce the expected results for the test cases.
