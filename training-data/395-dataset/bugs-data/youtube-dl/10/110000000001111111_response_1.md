The problem with the given function `js_to_json` is that it is not handling the escaping properly and also not handling the JSON keys and values correctly.

The errors in the given function are likely due to the incorrect parsing of the input `code` and handling of the regular expression.

A possible approach for fixing the bug would be to use the `json` module to parse the input `code` as JSON and then convert it back to a string.

Here's the corrected code for the `js_to_json` function:

```python
import json

# corrected function
def js_to_json(code):
    # parse the input code as JSON
    parsed_json = json.loads(code)
    # convert the parsed JSON back to a string
    res = json.dumps(parsed_json)
    return res
```

Using the `json` module provides a reliable and built-in way to handle JSON parsing and conversion, avoiding potential issues with regular expressions and manual parsing.
