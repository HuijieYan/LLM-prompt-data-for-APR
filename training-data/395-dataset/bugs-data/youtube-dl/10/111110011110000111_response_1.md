The error suggests that the `json.loads` is failing due to extra data in the provided JSON string. This could mean that the `js_to_json` function is not converting the JavaScript string to a valid JSON string.

The potential error in the function `js_to_json` is the way it handles the quoting of strings. It uses regular expressions to match and transform the JavaScript string, but the transformation may not be handling all cases correctly.

The bug occurs because the regular expression and string manipulation logic may not be accurately converting the JavaScript string to a JSON string.

To fix the bug, a better approach would be to use a parser specifically designed for converting JavaScript objects to JSON. One option would be to use the `demjson` library which provides a `decode` method for parsing JavaScript objects. This library may handle the transformation of JavaScript strings more accurately.

Below is the corrected code using the `demjson` library:

```python
import demjson

def js_to_json(code):
    return demjson.decode(code, strict=False)
```

Using the `demjson` library's `decode` method with `strict=False` will allow it to handle JavaScript strings and convert them into valid JSON strings. This should resolve the bug and allow the test function to pass without errors.
