The error message indicates that there is an issue with extra data in the JSON string. This extra data issue is due to an error in the `js_to_json` function, particularly in the regular expressions used for substitution.

The `js_to_json` function has two regular expression substitutions, and they are potentially causing the problem. The regular expressions are intended to match JSON strings and convert them into valid JSON. However, the current implementation is producing a faulty result.

One possible approach to fixing this bug is to review and modify the regular expressions used in the `js_to_json` function to ensure correct matching and substitution. Additionally, the `fix_kv` inner function may need some modification to handle the replacement of matched substrings properly.

The corrected code for the `js_to_json` function is provided below:

```python
import re
import json

def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
            return v
        if v.startswith('"'):
            return v
        if v.startswith("'"):
            v = v[1:-1]
            v = re.sub(r"\\\\|\\'|\"", lambda x: {'\\\\': '\\\\', "\\'": "'", '"': '\\"'}[x.group(0)], v)
            return f'"{v}"'
        return f'"{v}"'
    
    # modify the regular expression for matching
    res = re.sub(r'''(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\")?)*['"]|true|false|null|[a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*''', fix_kv, code)
    res = re.sub(r',(\s*\])', lambda m: m.group(1), res)
    return res
```

In the corrected `js_to_json` function, the regular expression patterns have been modified for more accurate matching. Additionally, the `fix_kv` function has been updated to correctly replace the matched substrings. These changes should address the bug and ensure that the JSON conversion works as intended.
