The issue here seems to be with the `fix_kv` function within the `js_to_json` function. The `fix_kv` function is not returning the correct values according to the expected output, and it is not handling the escaped characters and quotes properly.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `fix_kv` function to handle escaped characters and quotes correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `js_to_json` function:

```python
import re

def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
            return v
        if v.startswith('"'):
            return v
        if v.startswith("'"):
            v = v[1:-1]
            v = re.sub(r"\\\\|\\'|\\\"", lambda m: {
                '\\\\': '\\\\',
                "\\'": "'",
                '"': '\\"',
            }[m.group(0)], v)
            return '"%s"' % v
        return '"%s"' % v
    
    res = re.sub(r'''(?x)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\")?)*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\')?)*'|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*
        ''', fix_kv, code)

    res = re.sub(r',(\s*\])', lambda m: m.group(1), res)
    return res
```

The `fix_kv` function has been updated to properly handle escaped characters and quotes, and a default return statement has been added to handle any other cases.
