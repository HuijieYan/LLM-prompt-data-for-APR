The bug in the `js_to_json` function is that the `fix_kv` function does not correctly handle the replacement of the escape sequences and the single quotes in the input string.

The potential error location is within the `fix_kv` function, particularly in the logic for handling escape sequences and single quotes.

The bug occurs because the `fix_kv` function's logic for replacing escape sequences and handling single quotes is not correctly implemented. This results in incorrect processing of the input string, leading to unexpected output.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `fix_kv` function to correctly handle escape sequences and single quotes in the input string.

Here's the corrected code for the `js_to_json` function:

```python
import re

def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
            return v
        if v.startswith('"'):
            return v
        if v.startswith("'"):
            v = v[1:-1]
            v = re.sub(r'\\\\|\\\'|\"', lambda m: {
                '\\\\': '\\\\',
                "\\'": "'",
                '"': '\\"',
            }[m.group(0)], v)
            return '"%s"' % v
        return '"%s"' % v
    
    res = re.sub(r'''(?x)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\")?)*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\')?)*'|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*
        ''', fix_kv, code)
    res = re.sub(r',(\s*\])', lambda m: m.group(1), res)
    return res
```

With this corrected code, the `fix_kv` function will now correctly handle escape sequences and single quotes, producing the expected output for the given test cases.
