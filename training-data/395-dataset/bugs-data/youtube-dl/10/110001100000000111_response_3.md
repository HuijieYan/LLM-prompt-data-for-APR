Potential error location:
The issue likely lies in the `js_to_json` function, particularly in the `fix_kv` nested function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The current implementation of the `fix_kv` function does not handle all cases correctly. It fails to properly convert certain characters (e.g. single quotes, backslashes) to their corresponding JSON format.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should update the `fix_kv` function to correctly convert characters to their JSON format, including handling escape sequences and special characters within strings. Additionally, we should ensure that the regular expressions used in the `js_to_json` function are correctly handling all cases, including nested strings and array elements.

Corrected code:

```python
import re

def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
            return v
        if v.startswith('"'):
            return v
        if v.startswith("'"):
            v = v[1:-1]
            v = re.sub(r"\\\\|\\'|\"", lambda m: {
                '\\\\': '\\\\',
                "\\'": "'",
                '"': '\\"',
            }[m.group(0)], v)
            return '"%s"' % v

    res = re.sub(r'''(?x)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\")?)*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\')?)*'|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*
        ''', fix_kv, code)
    res = re.sub(r',(\s*\])', lambda m: m.group(1), res)
    return res
```
