The bug in the provided function `prepare_filename` seems to be related to the formatting of the output filename. The error message from the test function shows that when the input contains the string '$PATH' in the title, it is not correctly formatted in the output.

The bug likely occurs because the `sanitize_filename` function is not handling the '$' character in the input string. This is causing the output filename to be incorrectly formatted.

To fix this bug, the `sanitize_filename` function should be updated to handle the '$' character appropriately, ensuring that it does not affect the output filename.

Here's the corrected code for the `prepare_filename` function:

```python
def prepare_filename(self, info_dict):
    """Generate the output filename."""
    try:
        template_dict = dict(info_dict)

        # Rest of the code remains the same

        sanitize = lambda k, v: sanitize_filename(
            compat_str(v),
            restricted=self.params.get('restrictfilenames'),
            is_id=(k == 'id' or k.endswith('_id')))

        # Updated sanitize to handle $ character
        sanitize = lambda k, v: sanitize.replace('$', '_').replace('%', '_')

        template_dict = dict((k, v if isinstance(v, compat_numeric_types) else sanitize(k, v))
                             for k, v in template_dict.items()
                             if v is not None and not isinstance(v, (list, tuple, dict)))

        # Rest of the code remains the same
    except ValueError as err:
        self.report_error('Error in output template: ' + str(err) + ' (encoding: ' + repr(preferredencoding()) + ')')
        return None
```

In the corrected code, the lambda function `sanitize` has been updated to replace the '$' and '%' characters with underscores in the input string. This should prevent any issues related to these characters in the input title.
