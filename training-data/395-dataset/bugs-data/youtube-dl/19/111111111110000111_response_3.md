The error occurs when the string '$PATH' is contained in the video title. The function `prepare_filename` is responsible for generating the output filename based on the provided `info_dict`. The issue arises from the use of the 'sanitize' lambda function to sanitize the filename, which incorrectly treats '$PATH' as a system variable and attempts to replace it.

To fix this bug, the 'sanitize' function should be modified to handle the special case of '$' followed by a string, and ignore it instead of trying to replace it as a system variable.

Here's the corrected code for the `prepare_filename` method:

```python
def prepare_filename(self, info_dict):
    """Generate the output filename."""
    try:
        # ... (existing code)

        sanitize = lambda k, v: sanitize_filename(
            compat_str(v),
            restricted=self.params.get('restrictfilenames'),
            is_id=(k == 'id' or k.endswith('_id')))
        
        # Modify the 'sanitize' function to handle the special case of '$' followed by a string
        def sanitize_special(k, v):
            if v and v.startswith('$'):
                return v
            return sanitize(k, v)

        template_dict = dict((k, v if isinstance(v, compat_numeric_types) else sanitize_special(k, v))
                             for k, v in template_dict.items()
                             if v is not None and not isinstance(v, (list, tuple, dict)))
        template_dict = collections.defaultdict(lambda: 'NA', template_dict)
        
        # ... (remaining code)
        
    except ValueError as err:
        self.report_error('Error in output template: ' + str(err) + ' (encoding: ' + repr(preferredencoding()) + ')')
        return None
```

With this change, the `sanitize` lambda function is modified to handle the special case of '$' followed by a string, preventing it from being treated as a system variable.

This fix should address the bug when '$PATH' is contained in the video title and ensure that the `prepare_filename` method behaves as expected.
