The error occurs when the `prepare_filename` function is called with the title containing the string '$PATH'. The function is not handling this special character appropriately, resulting in a failed assertion in the test case.

The potential error location within the `prepare_filename` function is in the `sanitize` lambda function, which is used to sanitize the filename. This function is not handling the '$' character correctly.

The bug occurs because the `sanitize` function is not properly escaping the '$' character, causing it to be interpreted as a special character in the filename format. This leads to unexpected behavior when the filename is generated.

To fix the bug, the `sanitize` function should be modified to properly handle the '$' character by escaping it in the filename.

Here's the corrected code for the `prepare_filename` function:

```python
def prepare_filename(self, info_dict):
    """Generate the output filename."""
    try:
        template_dict = dict(info_dict)

        # ... (previous code remains unchanged) ...

        sanitize = lambda k, v: sanitize_filename(
            compat_str(v),
            restricted=self.params.get('restrictfilenames'),
            is_id=(k == 'id' or k.endswith('_id')))
        
        # Add handling for special characters in the title
        template_dict = {k: v.replace('$', '_') if k.startswith('title') else v for k, v in template_dict.items()}

        template_dict = dict((k, v if isinstance(v, compat_numeric_types) else sanitize(k, v))
                             for k, v in template_dict.items()
                             if v is not None and not isinstance(v, (list, tuple, dict)))
        template_dict = collections.defaultdict(lambda: 'NA', template_dict)

        # ... (remaining code remains unchanged) ...

    except ValueError as err:
        self.report_error('Error in output template: ' + str(err) + ' (encoding: ' + repr(preferredencoding()) + ')')
        return None
```

In the modified code, a handling for special characters in the title is added to replace the '$' character with an underscore '_'.

With these modifications, the `prepare_filename` function should now handle the special character '$' in the title correctly, resolving the bug.
