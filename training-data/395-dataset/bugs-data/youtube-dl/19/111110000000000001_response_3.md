Potential error location: The potential error in the prepare_filename function is the missing import for the required modules such as time and collections.

Reason for the occurrence of the bug: The code is trying to use the 'time' module without importing it, and it also uses the 'collections' module without importing it. This will result in a NameError when trying to use these modules.

Approach for fixing the bug: The bug can be fixed by importing the 'time' and 'collections' modules at the beginning of the file.

Corrected code:
```python
import time
import re
import collections

# class declaration containing the buggy function
class YoutubeDL(object):
    """
    YoutubeDL class.
    ...
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def prepare_filename(self, info_dict):
        """Generate the output filename."""
        try:
            template_dict = dict(info_dict)
            
            # rest of the function remains unchanged
        except ValueError as err:
            self.report_error('Error in output template: ' + str(err) + ' (encoding: ' + repr(preferredencoding()) + ')')
            return None
```
