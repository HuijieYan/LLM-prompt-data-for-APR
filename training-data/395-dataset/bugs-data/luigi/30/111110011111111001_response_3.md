The bug in the provided code seems to be related to the comparison of the lists 'successes' and 'result' with an empty list in the test functions 'test_failure' and 'test_processing_time_handler_failure' respectively. The bug is causing the lists to have additional elements when compared to the expected empty list. 

Upon analysis, the potential error location within the problematic function seems to be the logic related to handling successes and failures. It appears that the function is not properly handling the outcomes of the task execution, leading to unexpected values in the 'successes' and 'result' lists.

The bug occurs because the function is not correctly updating the 'result' list with the outcome of the task execution, and as a result, the test cases are failing due to incorrect comparisons.

To fix this bug, the logic for handling successes and failures within the function needs to be reviewed and modified to ensure that the 'result' list is updated correctly based on the task outcomes. Additionally, any conditions or statements affecting the values of 'successes' and 'result' should be checked for accuracy.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def run(self):
    # ... (existing code)

    status = FAILED
    error_message = ''
    missing = []
    new_deps = []
    t0 = time.time()

    try:
        # Verify that all the tasks are fulfilled
        missing = [dep.task_id for dep in self.task.deps() if not dep.complete()]
        if missing:
            deps = 'dependency' if len(missing) == 1 else 'dependencies'
            raise RuntimeError('Unfulfilled %s at run time: %s' % (deps, ', '.join(missing)))
        
        self.task.trigger_event(Event.START, self.task)
        
        new_deps = self._run_get_new_deps()
        if new_deps is None:
            status = RUNNING
        else:
            status = SUSPENDED
            logger.info(
                '[pid %s] Worker %s new requirements      %s',
                os.getpid(), self.worker_id, self.task.task_id)
            return

    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        raise
    except BaseException as ex:
        status = FAILED
        logger.exception("[pid %s] Worker %s failed    %s", os.getpid(), self.worker_id, self.task)
        error_message = notifications.wrap_traceback(self.task.on_failure(ex))
        self.task.trigger_event(Event.FAILURE, self.task, ex)
        subject = f"Luigi: {self.task} FAILED"
        notifications.send_error_email(subject, error_message)

    finally:
        self.task.trigger_event(Event.PROCESSING_TIME, self.task, time.time() - t0)
        error_message = json.dumps(self.task.on_success())
        logger.info('[pid %s] Worker %s done      %s', os.getpid(),
                    self.worker_id, self.task.task_id)
        self.task.trigger_event(Event.SUCCESS, self.task)
        status = DONE
        
        self.result_queue.put(
            (self.task.task_id, status, error_message, missing, new_deps))
```

The corrected code aims to address the bug by ensuring that the 'result' list is populated accurately based on the outcomes of the task execution, and the relevant status and error message handling is done correctly.
