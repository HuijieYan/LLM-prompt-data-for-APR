The error message indicates that the `successes` list is not empty, even though it should be. This suggests that the `self._run_empty_task(True)` function call is not handling failures correctly, which in turn points to the buggy function `run`. Additionally, the error message from the second test function (`test_processing_time_handler_failure`) similarly highlights an issue with how the results are being handled, further pointing to the `run` function as the source of the problem.

The bug in the `run` function is that even if an exception is raised during task execution, the `status` is set to `FAILED` at the beginning of the function and never updated. As a result, the function always places the task in the list of failed tasks, regardless of whether the task execution was successful or not.

To fix this, the function should be modified to update the `status` to `FAILED` only when an exception is caught during the task execution. In the success case, it should be updated to `DONE`. Additionally, the function should handle setting the correct status in other parts of the code as well.

Here's the corrected `run` function:

```python
def run(self):
    # ... (existing code above this)

    # existing code

    status = None  # Initialize status to None

    try:
        # Verify that all the tasks are fulfilled!
        missing = [dep.task_id for dep in self.task.deps() if not dep.complete()]
        if missing:
            deps = 'dependency' if len(missing) == 1 else 'dependencies'
            raise RuntimeError('Unfulfilled %s at run time: %s' % (deps, ', '.join(missing)))

        self.task.trigger_event(Event.START, self.task)
        t0 = time.time()

        new_deps = self._run_get_new_deps()
        if new_deps is None:
            status = RUNNING
        else:
            status = SUSPENDED
            logger.info(
                '[pid %s] Worker %s new requirements      %s',
                os.getpid(), self.worker_id, self.task.task_id)
            return

        self.task.trigger_event(
            Event.PROCESSING_TIME, self.task, time.time() - t0)
        error_message = json.dumps(self.task.on_success())
        logger.info('[pid %s] Worker %s done      %s', os.getpid(),
                    self.worker_id, self.task.task_id)
        self.task.trigger_event(Event.SUCCESS, self.task)
        status = DONE  # Update status to DONE on successful completion

    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        raise
    except BaseException as ex:
        status = FAILED  # Update status to FAILED when exception is caught
        logger.exception("[pid %s] Worker %s failed    %s", os.getpid(), self.worker_id, self.task)
        error_message = notifications.wrap_traceback(self.task.on_failure(ex))
        self.task.trigger_event(Event.FAILURE, self.task, ex)
        subject = "Luigi: %s FAILED" % self.task
        notifications.send_error_email(subject, error_message)

    finally:
        self.result_queue.put(
            (self.task.task_id, status, error_message, missing, new_deps))
```

With these changes, the `status` variable is correctly updated based on the outcome of the task execution, and the test cases should pass without any errors.
