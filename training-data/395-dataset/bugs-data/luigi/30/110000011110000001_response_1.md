The error message from the test functions `test_failure` and `test_processing_time_handler_failure` indicates that the lists `successes` and `result` are not empty as expected. This suggests that the tasks are not completing as they should, leading to failures in the tests.

Upon analyzing the provided code, it appears that the issue might be related to the handling of task completion and failure. The function `run` is responsible for running tasks and handling their success or failure based on certain conditions. It seems that the logic for handling task completion and failure is not functioning correctly.

The potential error location is within the try-except block where task completion and failure are being handled.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug may be related to the incorrect status assignment and the handling of new dependencies.

To fix the bug, the code can be refactored to ensure that the status of tasks is correctly assigned based on their completion or failure. Additionally, the handling of new dependencies can be reviewed to ensure that it does not interfere with the task status.

Below is the corrected code for the `run` method:

```python
import os
import time
import random
import json
import logging

logger = logging.getLogger(__name__)

def run(self):
    logger.info('[pid %s] Worker %s running   %s', os.getpid(), self.worker_id, self.task.task_id)

    if self.random_seed:
        # Need to have different random seeds if running in separate processes
        random.seed((os.getpid(), time.time()))

    status = 'FAILED'
    error_message = ''
    missing = []
    new_deps = []
    try:
        # Verify that all the tasks are fulfilled
        missing = [dep.task_id for dep in self.task.deps() if not dep.complete()]
        if missing:
            deps = 'dependency' if len(missing) == 1 else 'dependencies'
            raise RuntimeError('Unfulfilled %s at run time: %s' % (deps, ', '.join(missing)))
        self.task.trigger_event('start', self.task)
        t0 = time.time()
        status = None
        new_deps = self._run_get_new_deps()
        if new_deps is None:
            status = 'RUNNING'
        else:
            status = 'SUSPENDED'
            logger.info(
                '[pid %s] Worker %s new requirements      %s',
                os.getpid(), self.worker_id, self.task.task_id)
            return
    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        raise
    except BaseException as ex:
        status = 'FAILED'
        logger.exception("[pid %s] Worker %s failed    %s", os.getpid(), self.worker_id, self.task)
        error_message = json.dumps(self.task.on_failure())
        self.task.trigger_event('failure', self.task, ex)
        subject = "Luigi: %s FAILED" % self.task
        errors.send_error_email(subject, error_message)
    finally:
        self.task.trigger_event(
            'processing_time', self.task, time.time() - t0)
        error_message = json.dumps(self.task.on_success())
        logger.info('[pid %s] Worker %s done      %s', os.getpid(),
                    self.worker_id, self.task.task_id)
        self.task.trigger_event('success', self.task)
        status = 'DONE'

    self.result_queue.put(
        (self.task.task_id, status, error_message, missing, new_deps))
```

In the corrected code:
1. The status is updated appropriately based on the task's completion or failure.
2. Handling of new dependencies is modified to ensure it does not interfere with the task status.
3. Logger events are refactored to use the appropriate event names.

After making these changes, the `run` method should handle the task completion and failure correctly, resolving the issues mentioned in the test error messages.
