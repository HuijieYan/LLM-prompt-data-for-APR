The test case "test_failure" is asserting that the list of successes should be empty, but it is actually containing one element "EmptyTask(fail=True)". Similarly, the test case "test_processing_time_handler_failure" is asserting that the list of results should be empty, but it is actually containing one element "(EmptyTask(fail=True), 42.0)".

Looking at the function "run" provided, it seems that the issue lies in the logic related to handling successes and failures. The "successes" and "failures" lists are not being updated correctly within the function.

The reason for the bug is that the "successes" list is not being populated with successful tasks and the "failures" list is not being populated with failed tasks within the "run" function, which is causing the test cases to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for populating the "successes" and "failures" lists within the "run" function based on the outcome of the tasks. Additionally, we need to ensure that the "new_deps" list is being populated correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the "run" function:

```python
def run(self):
    logger.info('[pid %s] Worker %s running   %s', os.getpid(), self.worker_id, self.task.task_id)

    if self.random_seed:
        random.seed((os.getpid(), time.time()))

    status = FAILED
    error_message = ''
    missing = []
    new_deps = []
    successes = []  # List to store successful tasks
    failures = []   # List to store failed tasks
    try:
        # Verify that all the tasks are fulfilled
        missing = [dep.task_id for dep in self.task.deps() if not dep.complete()]
        if missing:
            deps = 'dependency' if len(missing) == 1 else 'dependencies'
            raise RuntimeError('Unfulfilled %s at run time: %s' % (deps, ', '.join(missing)))
        
        self.task.trigger_event(Event.START, self.task)
        t0 = time.time()

        # The logic for handling successful and failed tasks
        if self._run_get_new_deps() is None:
            successes.append(self.task)
            status = DONE
        else:
            failures.append(self.task)
            status = RUNNING
        
        self.task.trigger_event(Event.PROCESSING_TIME, self.task, time.time() - t0)
        error_message = json.dumps(self.task.on_success())
        logger.info('[pid %s] Worker %s done      %s', os.getpid(), self.worker_id, self.task.task_id)
        self.task.trigger_event(Event.SUCCESS, self.task)

    except KeyboardInterrupt:
        raise
    except BaseException as ex:
        status = FAILED
        logger.exception("[pid %s] Worker %s failed    %s", os.getpid(), self.worker_id, self.task)
        error_message = notifications.wrap_traceback(self.task.on_failure(ex))
        self.task.trigger_event(Event.FAILURE, self.task, ex)
        subject = "Luigi: %s FAILED" % self.task
        notifications.send_error_email(subject, error_message)
    finally:
        self.result_queue.put((self.task.task_id, status, error_message, missing, new_deps, successes, failures))
```
In this corrected version, I have added "successes" and "failures" lists to keep track of successful and failed tasks. Depending on the outcome of the task, we update these lists accordingly. Additionally, I have added "successes" and "failures" lists to the output of the result_queue.

This should fix the issue with the test cases.
