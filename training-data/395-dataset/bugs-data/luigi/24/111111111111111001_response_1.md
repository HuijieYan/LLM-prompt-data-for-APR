The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is that it incorrectly adds double quotes around the value when creating the command list. This is evident from the error messages, where the comparison of the command lists fails due to the presence of double quotes around the values in the actual command list.

The function incorrectly appends double quotes to the value when building the command list. This is not necessary and causes the command list to differ from the expected command list in the test cases.

To fix the bug, the function should append the values without enclosing them in double quotes. This would align the actual behavior of the function with the expectation in the test cases and resolve the errors.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the function will correctly build the command list without unnecessary double quotes, resolving the issues seen in the test cases.
