Potential Issue:
The issue with the current _dict_arg function is that it reuses the variable name "value" for both the input dictionary and the values within the dictionary. This creates a conflict and leads to incorrect data being added to the command list.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurred because the same variable name "value" was used for both the input dictionary and the individual values within the dictionary. This caused confusion and resulted in incorrect data being added to the command list.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to rename the variable used to iterate through the dictionary items so that it does not conflict with the name of the input dictionary. Additionally, we should also handle the case where the value is not a dictionary.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():  # Renamed the variables to key and val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(key, val)]
    return command
```
