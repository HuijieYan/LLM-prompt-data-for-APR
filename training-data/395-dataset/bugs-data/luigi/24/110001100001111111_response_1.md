The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it is using double quotes around the key-value pair, which is not necessary and causing the values to be incorrectly formatted.

To fix this issue, the double quotes around the key-value pairs in the `command` list should be removed.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.extend([name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)])
    return command
```
