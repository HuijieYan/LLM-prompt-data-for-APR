The issue in the `_dict_arg` function is that it is incorrectly adding quotes around the property and value pairs. This is causing the test cases to fail because the expected and actual output do not match due to the additional quotes.

The reason for this bug is that the function adds quotes to the property=value pairs in the command list, causing the strings to be formatted incorrectly.

To fix this bug, the function should not add quotes around the property=value pairs when constructing the command list.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the quotes around `{0}={1}`, the function will correctly construct the command list without additional quotes around the property=value pairs.
