The bug in the function `_dict_arg` is due to the unnecessary use of double quotes around the value in the command list. This is causing a mismatch between the expected and actual output, leading to the assertion errors in the test cases.

Reason behind the bug:
The buggy function unnecessarily adds double quotes around the `prop=value` pairs in the command list. This causes a mismatch between the expected and actual command lists in the test cases.

Approach to fix the bug:
To fix the bug, simply remove the double quotes around the `{0}={1}` format in the `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]` line. 

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected code removes the unnecessary double quotes around the `{0}={1}` format, which should resolve the assertion errors in the test cases.
