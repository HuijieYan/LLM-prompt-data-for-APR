Potential Error Location: The bug is likely in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`, where the command is being built by concatenating strings.

Reason for Bug: The bug is caused by using the `+=` operator to concatenate strings to the `command` list. This results in the concatenation of strings and lists, leading to unexpected behavior.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug: Use the `append()` method to add elements to the `command` list instead of using the `+=` operator.

Corrected Code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append('{0}="{1}={2}"'.format(name, prop, val))
    return command
```
