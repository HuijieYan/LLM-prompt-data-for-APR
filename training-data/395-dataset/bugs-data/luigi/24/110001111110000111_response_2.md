The error message indicates that the `--conf` parameter is not formatted correctly, and it's causing a failure in the test case comparison.

The potential error location within the `_dict_arg` function is in the line where the `--conf` parameter is being constructed by concatenating prop and value using `"Prop=Value"`. This results in a string with double quotes, which causes the test to fail.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `--conf` parameter should not have its value enclosed in double quotes.

To fix the bug, the `value` should be added to the `command` list as a single string without double quotes.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes around the `prop` and `val` in the command list, the issue causing the failed test cases is resolved.
