The potential error in the provided function is that the variable `value` is being used both as a function argument and within the for loop to iterate over the dictionary. This will lead to unexpected behavior and an incorrect command being formed.

To fix the bug, the variable name within the for loop needs to be changed to something different from the function argument name. Additionally, the command generation logic can be improved to handle cases where the value is not a dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    elif value:
        command += [name, str(value)]
    return command
``` 

In the corrected code, the variable inside the for loop has been changed to `val` to avoid conflict, and an additional check has been added to handle the case where `value` is not a dictionary.
