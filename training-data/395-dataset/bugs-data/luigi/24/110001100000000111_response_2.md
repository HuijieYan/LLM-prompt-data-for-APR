Potential error location: The potential error in the function is with the variable name "value", which is being used for both the input parameter and the loop variable inside the function.

Reason for the bug: The variable "value" is being reassigned within the for loop, causing unexpected behavior and potentially overwriting the original value.

Approach for fixing the bug: Rename the loop variable to avoid overwriting the input parameter value.

Corrected code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Rename the loop variable to 'val'
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Use the renamed loop variable 'val'
    return command
```
