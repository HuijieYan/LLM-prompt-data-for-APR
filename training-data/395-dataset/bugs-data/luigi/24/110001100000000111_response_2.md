Potential error location: The error may occur within the loop that is attempting to build the command list by concatenating strings.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug occurs because the loop is overwriting the 'value' variable, which was originally used as a parameter to the function. This causes unexpected behavior and incorrect command building.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Use a different variable name within the loop to avoid overwriting the 'value' parameter.
- Avoid using 'value' as a loop variable altogether to prevent confusion and unintended overwriting.

Corrected code:
```python
    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, prop_value in value.items():  # Use a different variable name here
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, prop_value)]
        return command
```
