Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. This line is not correctly constructing the command for the dictionary elements.

Reason for the bug: The `"{0}={1}"` format is adding double quotes around the key-value pair, which is not necessary.

Approach for fixing the bug: Remove the double quotes around the key-value pair.

Corrected code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
