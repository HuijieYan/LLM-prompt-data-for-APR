Potential error location: The error could be occurring in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]` as it is trying to concatenate a list with a string.

Reason behind the bug: The function is trying to create a list of commands but is incorrectly concatenating a list with a string, which is causing an error.

Approach for fixing the bug: We need to revise the way the command list is being formed. Instead of concatenating a list with a string, we should append the command to the list.

Corrected code:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(f"{name} \"{prop}={val}\"")
    return command
```
