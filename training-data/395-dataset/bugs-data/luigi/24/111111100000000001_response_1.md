Potential error location: The potential error in the function is the reusing of the variable name "value" for both the function argument and the loop variable.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: By reusing the variable name "value" for both the function argument and the loop variable, the original value passed to the function is being overwritten and therefore not accessible within the loop.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, we can use a different variable name for the loop variable in order to prevent the original value from being overwritten. Additionally, we can use Python's f-strings for string formatting instead of the `format` method.

Corrected code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, f'"{prop}={val}"']
    return command
```
