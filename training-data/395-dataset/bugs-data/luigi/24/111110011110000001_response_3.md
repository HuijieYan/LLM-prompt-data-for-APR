The error message indicates a difference in the list of arguments passed to the process call. It seems that the `_dict_arg` function is not formatting the dictionary values correctly, leading to a mismatch in the expected and actual arguments when the function is called.

Upon reviewing the `_dict_arg` function, it appears that the issue lies in the formatting of dictionary values. The current implementation is enclosing the values in double quotes, which is unnecessary and causing the discrepancy.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `_dict_arg` function to format the dictionary items without double quotes as individual key-value pairs in the command list.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the function will correctly format the dictionary items without unnecessary double quotes and address the discrepancy observed in the test cases.
