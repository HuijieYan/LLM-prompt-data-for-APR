The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is related to the unnecessary addition of double quotes around the property and its value while constructing the command list.

The error message from the test functions indicates that the constructed command list does not match the expected one due to the inclusion of unnecessary double quotes.

To fix this bug, the unnecessary double quotes around the property and value pair should be removed from the command list construction.

Below is the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]  # removed unnecessary double quotes here
    return command
```
