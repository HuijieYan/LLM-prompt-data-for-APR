The error occurs due to the buggy `_dict_arg` function in the `SparkSubmitTask` class. The function is not correctly constructing the command list when the input value is a dictionary.

The bug is caused by incorrectly using double-quotes around the values in the `command` list. This results in a mismatch with the expected values in the test cases.

To fix the bug:
1. Iterate through the dictionary and construct the command strings without enclosing them in double-quotes.
2. Update the test cases to reflect the expected changes in the command list.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

With this correction, the function will construct the command list correctly, and the test cases should output the expected results without errors.

After making these changes, the test cases should pass without any issues.
