The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not correctly formatting the command list. It is adding unnecessary double quotes around the key-value pairs and not handling the case when the `value` parameter is empty or not a dictionary.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the function to correctly format the command list and handle the cases when the `value` parameter is empty or not a dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, prop_value in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, prop_value)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the `prop` and `prop_value` are concatenated directly without unnecessary double quotes and the function now checks if the `value` parameter is not empty and is a dictionary before iterating over its items. This should solve the issue and produce the expected command list.
