The potential error in the `_dict_arg` function is that it tries to iterate over the `value`, which is also being used as an input parameter. This can cause unexpected behavior and errors.

The reason for the bug is that the function is overwriting the `value` parameter with a loop variable in the for loop.

To fix the bug, we can change the loop variable to something other than `value` to avoid overwriting the input parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change the loop variable from value to val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
