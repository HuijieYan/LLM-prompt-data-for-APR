The issue description is:

```text
Since running tasks communicate with worker via a queue, all dynamic dependencies that they yield must be serialized and then deserialized back. This doesn't work if a task has run = NotImplemented, since there was a specific check for that in Register for unclear reason.

This PR adds a test case to reproduce the issue and fixes it by removing the check.
```
