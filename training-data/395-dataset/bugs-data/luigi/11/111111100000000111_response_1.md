Potential error location: The `@rpc_method` decorator is incorrectly applied to the `get_work` method. Since the `@rpc_method` decorator is being passed arguments (`allow_null=False`), it seems like it is intended for a different method altogether.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `@rpc_method` decorator takes arguments, but it's incorrectly applied to the `get_work` method, so it's not being used as intended.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Remove the `@rpc_method` decorator from the `get_work` method and check if the `@rpc_method` decorator is intended for another method.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
class Scheduler(object):
    """
    Async scheduler that can handle multiple workers, etc.
    
    Can be run locally or on a server (using RemoteScheduler + server.Server).
    """

    def get_work(self, host=None, assistant=False, current_tasks=None, worker=None, **kwargs):
        # ... (existing logic for the get_work method)
        pass
```
