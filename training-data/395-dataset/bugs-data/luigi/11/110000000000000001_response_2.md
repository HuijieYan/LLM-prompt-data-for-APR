Potential Error Location: 
The potential error location within the problematic function includes issues with handling the batched tasks, checking for resource availability, and setting the status of the best task.

Reasons behind the Bug:
1. The function does not handle the batched tasks correctly, which can lead to incorrect task assignment to workers.
2. The resource availability check has issues, potentially leading to incorrect task prioritization.
3. The status of the best task is not set correctly, which can cause discrepancies in task management.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Properly handle the batched tasks and ensure that tasks are assigned to workers correctly.
2. Improve the resource availability check to prioritize tasks accurately based on the available resources.
3. Set the status of the best task correctly and ensure that task management is handled accurately.

Corrected Code:
```python

    if self._config.prune_on_get_work:
        self.prune()

    assert worker is not None
    worker_id = worker
    self.update(worker_id, {'host': host}, get_work=True)
    if assistant:
        self.add_worker(worker_id, [('assistant', assistant)])

    best_task = None
    running_tasks = []
    locally_pending_tasks = 0
    n_unique_pending = 0

    tasks = self._state.get_pending_tasks()
    tasks.sort(key=self._rank, reverse=True)

    for task in tasks:
        in_workers = (assistant and getattr(task, 'runnable', bool(task.workers))) or worker_id in task.workers
        if task.status == RUNNING and in_workers:
            other_worker = self._state.get_worker(task.worker_running)
            more_info = {'task_id': task.id, 'worker': str(other_worker)}
            if other_worker is not None:
                more_info.update(other_worker.info)
                running_tasks.append(more_info)

        if task.status == PENDING and in_workers:
            locally_pending_tasks += 1
            if len(task.workers) == 1 and not assistant:
                n_unique_pending += 1

        if assistant or task.status == RUNNING:
            continue

        if self._schedulable(task) and self._has_resources(task.resources):
            best_task = task
            break

    reply = {'n_pending_tasks': locally_pending_tasks,
             'running_tasks': running_tasks,
             'task_id': None,
             'n_unique_pending': n_unique_pending}

    if best_task:
        self._state.set_status(best_task, RUNNING, self._config)
        best_task.worker_running = worker_id
        best_task.time_running = time.time()
        self._update_task_history(best_task, RUNNING, host=host)

        reply['task_id'] = best_task.id
        reply['task_family'] = best_task.family
        reply['task_module'] = getattr(best_task, 'module', None)
        reply['task_params'] = best_task.params

    return reply
