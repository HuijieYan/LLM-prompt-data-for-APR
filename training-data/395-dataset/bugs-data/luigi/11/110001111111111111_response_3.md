Based on the test case and the error message, it appears that the `response['task_params']` is not as expected. The test expects `{'a': ['1', '3', '4']}`, but the actual value is `{'a': ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']}`. This inconsistency in the output suggests that there is a bug in the logic of the `get_work` function related to batched tasks.

The bug seems to be occurring in the logic for handling batched tasks. It appears that the batched parameters are not being handled correctly, leading to incorrect batched task parameters in the response.

The potential cause of this bug could be the incorrect handling of batched tasks and their parameters in the `get_work` function. It seems that the combination of batched and unbatched parameters is not being processed accurately.

To fix this bug, the `get_work` function needs to be updated to correctly handle the batched parameters and form the response with the expected parameters for batched tasks. This might involve adjusting the logic for combining batched and unbatched parameters to ensure they are aggregated correctly and matching the expected values.

Here's the corrected `get_work` function:

```python
# import statements if necessary

@rpc_method(allow_null=False)
def get_work(self, host=None, assistant=False, current_tasks=None, worker=None, **kwargs):
    # existing code...

    reply = {'n_pending_tasks': locally_pending_tasks,
             'running_tasks': running_tasks,
             'task_id': None,
             'n_unique_pending': n_unique_pending}

    if len(batched_tasks) > 1:
        batch_string = '|'.join(task.id for task in batched_tasks)
        batch_id = hashlib.md5(batch_string.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()
        for task in batched_tasks:
            self._state.set_batch_running(task, batch_id, worker_id)

        combined_params = best_task.params.copy()
        combined_params.update(batched_params)

        reply['task_params'] = combined_params
        reply['batch_id'] = batch_id
        reply['batch_task_ids'] = [task.id for task in batched_tasks]
    
    elif best_task:
        self._state.set_status(best_task, RUNNING, self._config)
        best_task.worker_running = worker_id
        best_task.time_running = time.time()
        self._update_task_history(best_task, RUNNING, host=host)

        reply['task_id'] = best_task.id
        reply['task_params'] = best_task.params

    return reply
```

In this corrected function, the response is formed by combining the batched and unbatched parameters correctly. This should address the issue observed in the test case. Make sure to incorporate this corrected code into the original `get_work` function in the `luigi/scheduler.py` file.
