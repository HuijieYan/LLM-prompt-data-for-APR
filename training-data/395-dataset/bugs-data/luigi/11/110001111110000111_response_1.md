The test case `test_batch_ignore_items_not_ready` adds several tasks and batchers to the scheduler and then calls the `get_work` method of the scheduler. The error message indicates that there is an assertion error in the test case. The expected `task_params` do not match the actual `task_params` returned from the `get_work` method.

The issue seems to be related to the handling of pending and running tasks in the `get_work` method of the scheduler.

The bug appears to be due to the handling of pending tasks and available resources. The method does not accurately determine the available tasks that can be run by the worker, which results in incorrect `task_params` being returned.

To fix the bug, the `get_work` method needs to be corrected to accurately identify pending tasks that are runnable by the worker. The prioritization of tasks based on resources and conditions for batched tasks also needs to be properly handled.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_work` method:

```python
@rpc_method(allow_null=False)
def get_work(self, host=None, assistant=False, current_tasks=None, worker=None, **kwargs):
    if self._config.prune_on_get_work:
        self.prune()
    
    assert worker is not None
    worker_id = worker
    
    # Add condition to check for worker being trivial
    worker = self._state.get_worker(worker_id)
    if worker.is_trivial_worker(self._state):
        relevant_tasks = worker.get_pending_tasks(self._state)
        used_resources = collections.defaultdict(int)
        greedy_workers = {}  # If there's no resources, then they can grab any task
        irrelevant_tasks = self._state.get_pending_tasks()
    else:
        relevant_tasks = self._state.get_pending_tasks()
        used_resources = self._used_resources()
        activity_limit = time.time() - self._config.worker_disconnect_delay
        active_workers = self._state.get_active_workers(last_get_work_gt=activity_limit)
        greedy_workers = {worker.id: worker.info.get('workers', 1) for worker in active_workers}
        irrelevant_tasks = []

    tasks = list(relevant_tasks)
    tasks.sort(key=self._rank, reverse=True)
    best_task = None
    for task in tasks:
        # Check if the task is pendnig and runnabled by the worker
        if task.status == PENDING and (assistant and getattr(task, 'runnable', bool(task.workers)) or worker_id in task.workers):
            if self._schedulable(task) and self._has_resources(task.resources, used_resources):
                best_task = task
                break

    reply = {'n_pending_tasks': len(relevant_tasks) - len(irrelevant_tasks),
             'running_tasks': running_tasks,
             'task_id': None,
             'n_unique_pending': len(relevant_tasks) - len(irrelevant_tasks)}

    if best_task:
        self._state.set_status(best_task, RUNNING, self._config)
        best_task.worker_running = worker_id
        best_task.time_running = time.time()
        self._update_task_history(best_task, RUNNING, host=host)

        reply['task_id'] = best_task.id
        reply['task_family'] = best_task.family
        reply['task_module'] = getattr(best_task, 'module', None)
        reply['task_params'] = best_task.params
    
    return reply
```

This corrected `get_work` method focuses on properly checking the availability of pending tasks for the given worker. It ensures that the best task is assigned based on the available resources and task status.
