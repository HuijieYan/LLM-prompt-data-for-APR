The test case `test_batch_ignore_items_not_ready` sets up a scenario where it's expected that the `get_work` function in the Scheduler class would return a specific set of tasks to be processed based on certain conditions. However, the assertion in the test case fails because the actual result does not match the expected result.

The potential error location within the `get_work` function is the logic related to batched tasks and the building of the response parameters.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code logic for handling batched tasks and determining the response parameters is not correctly identifying the eligible tasks to be processed.

To fix the bug, we need to review the logic for determining batched tasks, building batched parameters, and identifying the best task to be processed. It seems that not all eligible tasks are being considered for the batched processing. We also need to ensure that the response parameters are correctly constructed based on the batched tasks.

The corrected code for the `get_work` function is as follows:

```python
# Corrected get_work function
@rpc_method(allow_null=False)
def get_work(self, host=None, assistant=False, current_tasks=None, worker=None, **kwargs):
    if self._config.prune_on_get_work:
        self.prune()

    assert worker is not None
    worker_id = worker
    self.update(worker_id, {'host': host}, get_work=True)
    if assistant:
        self.add_worker(worker_id, [('assistant', assistant)])

    pending_tasks = self._state.get_pending_tasks()

    batched_params = None
    batched_tasks = [task for task in pending_tasks if task.is_batchable()]
    if batched_tasks:
        batched_params = {name: list({task.params[name] for task in batched_tasks}) for name in batched_tasks[0].params.keys()}

    reply = {
        'task_id': None,
        'task_family': None,
        'task_module': None,
        'task_params': None,
        'batch_id': None,
        'batch_task_ids': []
    }

    if batched_tasks:
        batch_string = '|'.join(task.id for task in batched_tasks)
        batch_id = hashlib.md5(batch_string.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()
        for task in batched_tasks:
            self._state.set_batch_running(task, batch_id, worker_id)
        
        combined_params = batched_params
        reply['task_id'] = None
        reply['task_family'] = batched_tasks[0].family
        reply['task_module'] = getattr(batched_tasks[0], 'module', None)
        reply['task_params'] = combined_params
        reply['batch_id'] = batch_id
        reply['batch_task_ids'] = [task.id for task in batched_tasks]
    else:
        for task in pending_tasks:
            if task.is_batchable():
                continue
            if self._schedulable(task):
                reply['task_id'] = task.id
                reply['task_family'] = task.family
                reply['task_module'] = getattr(task, 'module', None)
                reply['task_params'] = task.params
                break

    return reply
```
