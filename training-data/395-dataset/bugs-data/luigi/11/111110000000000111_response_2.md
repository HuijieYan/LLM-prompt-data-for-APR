Sure! Here's the full corrected code for the `get_work` function:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class Scheduler(object):
    """
    Async scheduler that can handle multiple workers, etc.
    
    Can be run locally or on a server (using RemoteScheduler + server.Server).
    """
