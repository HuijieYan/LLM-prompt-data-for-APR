The provided test case `test_batch_ignore_items_not_ready` appears to be testing the behavior of the `get_work` method in the `Scheduler` class. The test adds tasks to the scheduler with dependencies and batchable parameters, and then calls `get_work` to fetch the next task for a specific worker.

The error message indicates that the expected value for `response['task_params']` is `{'a': ['1', '3', '4']}`, but the actual value is `{'a': ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']}`.

The potential error location within the `get_work` method is likely the logic that computes `combined_params` for batched tasks. It seems that the expected result does not match the actual result for the batchable parameters.

The bug occurs because the logic for forming `combined_params` and `batched_params` does not handle the inclusion of all batched tasks' parameters correctly, leading to the wrong `response['task_params']`.

To fix the bug, the logic for accumulating and combining batched parameters needs to be adjusted to accurately represent the batched tasks' parameters and their combinations.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_work` method:

```python
@rpc_method(allow_null=False)
def get_work(self, host=None, assistant=False, current_tasks=None, worker=None, **kwargs):
    # ... existing code ...

    if current_tasks is not None:
        # batch running tasks that weren't claimed since the last get_work go back in the pool
        self._reset_orphaned_batch_running_tasks(worker_id)

    # ... existing code ...

    reply = {'n_pending_tasks': locally_pending_tasks,
             'running_tasks': running_tasks,
             'task_id': None,
             'n_unique_pending': n_unique_pending}

    if len(batched_tasks) > 1:
        batch_string = '|'.join(task.id for task in batched_tasks)
        batch_id = hashlib.md5(batch_string.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()
        for task in batched_tasks:
            self._state.set_batch_running(task, batch_id, worker_id)

        combined_params = best_task.params.copy()
        for name, params in batched_params.items():
            combined_params[name] = params
        reply['task_id'] = None
        reply['task_family'] = best_task.family
        reply['task_module'] = getattr(best_task, 'module', None)
        reply['task_params'] = combined_params
        reply['batch_id'] = batch_id
        reply['batch_task_ids'] = [task.id for task in batched_tasks]
    elif best_task:
        # ... existing code ...
        reply['task_params'] = best_task.params  # Use the parameters of the best task

    return reply
```

With this correction, the `combined_params` are formed by adding the batched parameters to the existing parameters of the best task. This ensures that all batched parameters are included in the response, which should resolve the underlying bug.
