The test case `test_batch_ignore_items_not_ready` aims to check if the `get_work` function correctly filters out tasks that are not ready. It adds tasks and then expects that only ready tasks are returned.

Based on the error message, the `task_params` in the response does not match the expected value. The expected value is `{'a': ['1', '3', '4']}` while the actual value is `{'a': ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']}`.

The potential error location within the `get_work` function could be in the section where the tasks are filtered based on their status and worker eligibility.

The reason behind the bug could be that the task filtering logic, which involves determining if a task is available for worker execution, is not correctly implemented. This can lead to incorrect detection of ready tasks.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
- Reviewing and refining the logic for determining the readiness of tasks for worker execution.
- Ensuring that only tasks with the correct status and worker eligibility are included in the response.
- Testing with different scenarios to validate the correctness of the task filtering logic.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_work` function:

```python
@rpc_method(allow_null=False)
def get_work(self, host=None, assistant=False, current_tasks=None, worker=None, **kwargs):
    if self._config.prune_on_get_work:
        self.prune()

    assert worker is not None
    worker_id = worker

    response = {

        'running_tasks': [],
        'task_id': None,
        'n_unique_pending': 0,
        'task_family': None,
        'task_module': None,
        'task_params': None,
        'batch_id': None,
        'batch_task_ids': []
    }

    eligible_tasks = []
    for task in self._state.get_pending_tasks():
        if task.status == PENDING:
            if 'NOT_DONE' not in task.deps and 'DONE' in task.deps:
                response['n_pending_tasks'] += 1
                response['n_unique_pending'] += 1
                if len(task.workers) == 1 and not assistant:
                    response['n_unique_pending'] -= 1
                eligible_tasks.append(task)

    if current_tasks:
        self._reset_orphaned_batch_running_tasks(worker_id)

    if eligible_tasks:
        selected_task = max(eligible_tasks, key=self._rank)
        response['task_id'] = selected_task.id
        response['task_family'] = selected_task.family
        response['task_module'] = getattr(selected_task, 'module', None)
        response['task_params'] = selected_task.params
        if selected_task.is_batchable():
            batched_tasks = [t for t in self._state.get_running_tasks() if t.family == selected_task.family]

                batch_id = hashlib.md5(batch_string.encode('utf-8')).hexdigest()
                for t in batched_tasks:
                    self._state.set_batch_running(t, batch_id, worker_id)

                combined_params = selected_task.params.copy()
                combined_params.update(batched_params)

                response['task_params'] = combined_params
                response['batch_id'] = batch_id
                response['batch_task_ids'] = [t.id for t in batched_tasks]
        else:
            self._state.set_status(selected_task, RUNNING, self._config)
            selected_task.worker_running = worker_id
            selected_task.time_running = time.time()
            self._update_task_history(selected_task, RUNNING, host=host)

    return response
