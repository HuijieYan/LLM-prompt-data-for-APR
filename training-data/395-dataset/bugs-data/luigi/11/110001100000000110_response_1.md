    # TODO: remove any expired nodes
   
    # Algo: iterate over all nodes, find the highest priority node no dependencies and available
    # resources.

    # Resource checking looks both at currently available resources and at which resources would
    # be available if all running tasks died and we rescheduled all workers greedily. We do both
    # checks in order to prevent a worker with many low-priority tasks from starving other
    # workers with higher priority tasks that share the same resources.

    # TODO: remove tasks that can't be done, figure out if the worker has absolutely
    # nothing it can wait for
