The error in the provided code is that the function `get_work` has a mix of global variables and methods with internal variables. This leads to an inconsistency in the code and is likely the cause of the bug.

An approach to fixing this bug is to refactor the function `get_work` so that it uses internal variables and methods consistently. This can be achieved by using the `self` variable to access methods and variables within the class. 

Here is the corrected code for the function `get_work`:

```python
# Buggy function source code
# ... (previous code)

# corrected function get_work
def get_work(self, host=None, assistant=False, current_tasks=None, worker=None, **kwargs):
    if self._config.prune_on_get_work:
        self.prune()
    
    assert worker is not None
    worker_id = worker
    self.update(worker_id, {'host': host}, get_work=True)
    if assistant:
        self.add_worker(worker_id, [('assistant', assistant)])
  
    # ... (remaining code)
```

Using `self` to access the methods and variables within the class ensures consistency and avoids the mix of global and internal variables in the function.
