The error message from the test case `test_batch_ignore_items_not_ready` indicates that the assertion `self.assertEqual({'a': ['1', '3', '4']}, response['task_params'])` failed. This means that the expected dictionary `{'a': ['1', '3', '4']}` does not match the actual dictionary `{'a': ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']}`. 

This discrepancy is due to an error in the `get_work` method of the `Scheduler` class. The method is responsible for returning the work to be done by a worker, and in this case, it should only return tasks with the IDs `A_a_1`, `A_a_3`, and `A_a_4`. However, it includes tasks `A_a_2` and `A_a_5`, which are not ready.

The method fails to filter out tasks that are not ready based on their dependencies and does not prioritize only the tasks that are eligible for work.

To fix the bug, the method should ensure that only tasks with no dependencies or with all dependencies satisfied are returned. Additionally, it should prioritize the eligible tasks based on their priority and availability of resources.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_work` method:

```python
def get_work(self, host=None, assistant=False, current_tasks=None, worker=None, **kwargs):
    if self._config.prune_on_get_work:
        self.prune()

    assert worker is not None
    worker_id = worker
    
    # Return remaining tasks that have no FAILED descendants
    self.update(worker_id, {'host': host}, get_work=True)
    if assistant:
        self.add_worker(worker_id, [('assistant', assistant)])

    eligible_tasks = []
    for task in self._state.get_pending_tasks():
        if task.status == PENDING and not task.deps:
            eligible_tasks.append(task)

    # prioritize eligible tasks based on their priority
    eligible_tasks.sort(key=self._rank, reverse=True)

    reply = {'n_pending_tasks': len(eligible_tasks),
             'task_id': None,
             'n_unique_pending': len(eligible_tasks)}

    if eligible_tasks:
        best_task = eligible_tasks[0]
        self._state.set_status(best_task, RUNNING, self._config)
        best_task.worker_running = worker_id
        best_task.time_running = time.time()
        self._update_task_history(best_task, RUNNING, host=host)

        reply['task_id'] = best_task.id
        reply['task_family'] = best_task.family
        reply['task_module'] = getattr(best_task, 'module', None)
        reply['task_params'] = best_task.params

    return reply
```

In the corrected code, we first filter out tasks that are not eligible for work based on their dependencies. Then, we prioritize the eligible tasks based on their priority and return the best eligible task for the worker. This should address the bug and ensure that only the eligible tasks are returned as work.
