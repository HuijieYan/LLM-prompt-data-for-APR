The test case `test_batch_ignore_items_not_ready` adds several tasks and then calls `self.sch.get_work(worker=WORKER)` to retrieve the next task to be processed by a worker. The test is expecting the response `response['task_params']` to be `{'a': ['1', '3', '4']}` but is getting `{'a': ['1', '2', '3', '4', '5']}` instead.

The potential error location within the `get_work` function is likely related to the task filtering logic and batch processing. The bug seems to be related to the `get_work` function's logic for filtering tasks and forming batched_tasks.

The `get_work` function in its current form is not properly filtering the tasks based on their dependencies and not respecting the batchable tasks' dependencies. This results in including all tasks, including the ones that are not ready, in the response.

To fix this bug, the `get_work` function logic needs to be updated to properly filter out tasks that are not ready to be processed by the worker and form batched_tasks only with the eligible tasks.

Here's the corrected `get_work` function:

```python
@rpc_method(allow_null=False)
def get_work(self, host=None, assistant=False, current_tasks=None, worker=None, **kwargs):
    if self._config.prune_on_get_work:
        self.prune()

    assert worker is not None
    worker_id = worker
    self.update(worker_id, {'host': host}, get_work=True)
    if assistant:
        self.add_worker(worker_id, [('assistant', assistant)])

    relevant_tasks = self._state.get_running_and_pending_tasks(worker_id, assistant)

    best_task = None
    for task in relevant_tasks:
        if self._schedulable(task):
            best_task = task
            break

    reply = {
        'n_pending_tasks': len(relevant_tasks),
        'task_id': None
    }

    if best_task:
        if best_task.status == PENDING:
            self._state.set_status(best_task, RUNNING, self._config)
            best_task.worker_running = worker_id
            best_task.time_running = time.time()
            self._update_task_history(best_task, RUNNING, host=host)

        reply['task_id'] = best_task.id
        reply['task_family'] = best_task.family
        reply['task_module'] = getattr(best_task, 'module', None)
        reply['task_params'] = best_task.params

    return reply
```

This corrected `get_work` function filters the relevant tasks based on their status and whether they are schedulable. It then selects the best available task and prepares the response accordingly.
