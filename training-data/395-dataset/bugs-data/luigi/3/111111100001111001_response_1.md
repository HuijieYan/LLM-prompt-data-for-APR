Potential error location: The potential error in the provided function `parse` lies in the line `return literal_eval(x)`. This line attempts to parse the input `x` using `literal_eval`, but it does not handle the case when the input is a string representation of a list instead of a tuple.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The function does not account for the possibility that the input `x` might represent a list as a string, rather than a tuple. When `literal_eval` is used on a string that represents a list, it will raise a `ValueError`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check whether the input string `x` starts with "[" and ends with "]" to determine if it's a list representation.
2. If it's a list representation, convert it to a tuple using `literal_eval`.
3. If it's not a list representation, proceed with the existing logic of parsing the tuple of tuples using `json.loads`.

Here's the corrected code for the `parse` function:

```python
import json
import ast

def parse(self, x):
    """
    Parse an individual value from the input.

    :param str x: the value to parse.
    :return: the parsed value.
    """
    # Since the result of json.dumps(tuple) differs from a tuple string, we must handle either case.
    # A tuple string may come from a config file or from cli execution.

    # t = ((1, 2), (3, 4))
    # t_str = '((1,2),(3,4))'
    # t_json_str = json.dumps(t)
    # t_json_str == '[[1, 2], [3, 4]]'
    # json.loads(t_json_str) == t
    # json.loads(t_str) == ValueError: No JSON object could be decoded

    # Check if the input represents a list instead of a tuple
    if x.startswith("[") and x.endswith("]"):
        return tuple(ast.literal_eval(x))
    else:
        return tuple(tuple(item) for item in json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict))
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the input `x` represents a list, and if it does, we use `ast.literal_eval` to convert it into a tuple. If it does not represent a list, we proceed with the original logic of parsing the tuple of tuples using `json.loads`.
