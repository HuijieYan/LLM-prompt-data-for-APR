Given that the error message specifically mentions that a `TypeError` is being raised in the `parse` function at line 1107, the potential error location within the problematic function is the line `return tuple(tuple(x) for x in json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict))`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `parse` function is trying to iterate over a non-iterable `int` object, which is causing the `TypeError`.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `x` is a tuple string and convert it to a tuple using `literal_eval` instead of treating it as a JSON string. Also, we should handle the case where `x` is already a tuple and just return it without processing it through `json.loads`.

Here's the corrected code for the `parse` function:

```python
import json
from ast import literal_eval
from collections import OrderedDict

# ... other code ...

def parse(self, x):
    """
    Parse an individual value from the input.

    :param str x: the value to parse.
    :return: the parsed value.
    """
    if isinstance(x, tuple):
        return x  # Just return x if it's already a tuple

    try:
        # loop required to parse tuple of tuples
        return tuple(tuple(y) for y in json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=OrderedDict))
    except ValueError:
        return literal_eval(x)  # if this causes an error, let that error be raised.
```
