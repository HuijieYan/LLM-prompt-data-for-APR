# Corrected function

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class TupleParameter(ListParameter):
    # ... omitted code ...


    # this is the corrected function
    def parse(self, x):
        """
        Parse an individual value from the input.
    
        :param str x: the value to parse.
        :return: the parsed value.
        """
        # To fix the issue with TypeError, we need to add a try-except block to handle TypeError as well.

        try:
            # loop required to parse tuple of tuples
            return tuple(tuple(x) for x in json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict))
        except (ValueError, TypeError):
            return literal_eval(x)  # if this causes an error, let that error be raised.
```
The corrected function adds a try-except block to handle both ValueError and TypeError, fixing the issue described in the GitHub issue.
