The error occurred because of how the `parse` function was handling the input `x`. Specifically, the function used `json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict)` to attempt to parse the input as JSON. If that failed, it then attempted to use `literal_eval(x)`. However, this approach did not account for the case where `x` might not be a valid JSON string or a valid Python literal.

To fix this bug, the `parse` function should be updated to handle this case more robustly. It should use a `try-except` block to catch any `ValueError` or `TypeError` that might occur during the parsing process and properly handle them.

Here is the corrected `parse` function:

```python
def parse(self, x):
    """
    Parse an individual value from the input.

    :param str x: the value to parse.
    :return: the parsed value.
    """
    try:
        # attempt to parse as JSON
        return tuple(tuple(item) for item in json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict))
    except (ValueError, TypeError):
        try:
            return literal_eval(x)  # try to parse as a Python literal
        except (ValueError, SyntaxError):
            raise ValueError("Could not parse input as a tuple")
```

With this updated function, the input `x` will first be attempted to be parsed as JSON. If that fails, it will then be attempted to be parsed as a Python literal. If both fail, a `ValueError` will be raised indicating that the input could not be parsed as a tuple.
