The error message indicates that there is a 'TypeError' occurring in the `parse` function of the `TupleParameter` class. The error is specifically happening on this line of code: `return tuple(tuple(x) for x in json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict))`.

The reason for the bug is that it seems the code is trying to convert the elements in the input `x` into a tuple of tuples. However, the variable `x` seems to be an integer, which is causing the 'int' object is not iterable error.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `x` variable in the `parse` function of the `TupleParameter` class is handled correctly. It looks like the input `x` is expected to be a JSON string representing a tuple. Instead of treating it as an iterable, we should first parse it as a JSON string and handle any exceptions that may occur.

Here's the corrected code for the `parse` function of the `TupleParameter` class:

```python
import json
from ast import literal_eval  # at the top of the file

class TupleParameter(ListParameter):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def parse(self, x):
        """
        Parse an individual value from the input.

        :param str x: the value to parse.
        :return: the parsed value.
        """
        try:
            return literal_eval(x)
        except (SyntaxError, ValueError):
            try:
                return tuple(tuple(y) for y in json.loads(x))
            except (SyntaxError, ValueError):
                raise ValueError("Invalid tuple format")
```

In the corrected code, we first try to parse the input using `literal_eval`. If that raises a `SyntaxError` or `ValueError`, we then try to parse it using `json.loads`. If both methods fail, we raise a `ValueError` with a message indicating the invalid tuple format. This approach covers handling both JSON strings representing tuples and raw tuple strings.
