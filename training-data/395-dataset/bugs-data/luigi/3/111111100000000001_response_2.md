Potential error location: The line `return tuple(tuple(x) for x in json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict))` is likely causing the error as it is trying to convert a string to a tuple of tuples but is using the wrong approach.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The current code is trying to parse a string representing a tuple of tuples using a method that is not suitable for the task, leading to the ValueError.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Convert the input string into an actual tuple of tuples using the `ast.literal_eval` method, which is more appropriate for handling this type of string representation.

Corrected code:

```python
import json
import ast

def parse(self, x):
    """
    Parse an individual value from the input.

    :param str x: the value to parse.
    :return: the parsed value.
    """
    try:
        return ast.literal_eval(x)  # convert the input string to a tuple of tuples
    except ValueError:
        raise ValueError("Unable to parse the input as a tuple of tuples.")
```
