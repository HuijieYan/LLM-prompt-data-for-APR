The error occurs in the `parse` method of the `TupleParameter` class because it tries to convert the input value `x` into a tuple of tuples. The error message `TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable` indicates that the code is trying to iterate over an integer, which suggests that the input value `x` is being parsed incorrectly.

The reason for this bug is that the `parse` method attempts to convert the input using `json.loads` and then falls back to `ast.literal_eval` if a `ValueError` is raised. However, the input `x` is a string that represents a list, not a JSON object. Therefore, the `json.loads` function tries to parse it as JSON, resulting in unexpected output. 

To fix the bug, the `parse` method should first check if the input `x` represents a stringified tuple (i.e., starts with '(' and ends with ')'). If so, it should use `ast.literal_eval` to parse the input. If the parsing fails, a `ValueError` will be raised. If the input does not represent a stringified tuple, it can then be treated as a JSON array and parsed using `json.loads`.

Here's the corrected code for the `parse` method:

```python
import ast
import json

class TupleParameter(ListParameter):
    # ... (other code)

    def parse(self, x):
        """
        Parse an individual value from the input.

        :param str x: the value to parse.
        :return: the parsed value.
        """
        if x.startswith('(') and x.endswith(')'):
            try:
                return ast.literal_eval(x)
            except (ValueError, SyntaxError):
                raise ValueError("Could not parse the input as a tuple")
        else:
            # Parse the input as a JSON array
            try:
                return tuple(tuple(sublist) for sublist in json.loads(x))
            except (ValueError, TypeError):
                raise ValueError("Could not parse the input as a JSON array")
```

With this corrected code, the `parse` method first checks if the input `x` represents a stringified tuple. If so, it uses `ast.literal_eval` to parse it. If that fails, a `ValueError` is raised. If the input does not represent a stringified tuple, it is parsed as a JSON array using `json.loads`. Any parsing errors will result in a `ValueError` being raised.
