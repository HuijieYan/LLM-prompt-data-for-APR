The error occurs in the `parse` function of the `TupleParameter` class. The code is trying to parse a string as a tuple using both `json.loads` and `ast.literal_eval`.

The error message indicates that the issue is with the line:

```python
return tuple(tuple(x) for x in json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict))
```

The error message suggests that the code is trying to iterate over an integer, indicating that `x` is being interpreted as an integer rather than a tuple.

This error occurs because when `x` is passed as `'[1, 2, 3]'`, the `json.loads(x)` function will return a list `[1, 2, 3]`, not a tuple. When a list is passed to `tuple(x)` for each `x` in the list comprehension, it tries to iterate over the individual elements (integers) of the list, resulting in the error `'int' object is not iterable`.

A possible approach to fix the bug is to modify the code to handle list conversion to tuple, and also directly handle the conversion of the string to a tuple using `ast.literal_eval` in case `json.loads` fails.

Here's the corrected `parse` function:

```python
import json
import ast

def parse(self, x):
    """
    Parse an individual value from the input.

    :param str x: the value to parse.
    :return: the parsed value.
    """
    try:
        # loop required to parse tuple of tuples
        return tuple(tuple(y) for y in json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict))
    except ValueError:
        try:
            return literal_eval(x)  # if this causes an error, let that error be raised.
        except:
            raise ValueError("Invalid input")
```

With this correction, the function will first try to parse the input string using `json.loads`, and if that fails, it will attempt to parse it using `ast.literal_eval`. If both methods fail, it will raise a `ValueError` with the message "Invalid input."
