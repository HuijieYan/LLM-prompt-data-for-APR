The error occurs in the `parse` method of the `TupleParameter` class. The error message indicates a `TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable`, which suggests that the issue is related to iterating over an integer object, which is unexpected.

The issue arises due to the code `return tuple(tuple(x) for x in json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict))` in the `parse` method. This code is attempting to create a tuple from the input `x` by iterating over it. However, the `x` input is not iterable, resulting in the `TypeError`.

To fix this issue, the method should address non-iterable inputs differently, instead of attempting to create a tuple by iterating over a non-iterable object. One approach to handle this is to add a check to determine whether the input is a string or not. If it is a string, it can be directly evaluated using `ast.literal_eval`. If it is not a string, it can be passed through `json.loads` to handle other types of inputs. This ensures that different types of inputs, including non-iterable ones, are correctly parsed.

Here's the corrected code for the `parse` method of the `TupleParameter` class:

```python
import ast

# ... omitted code ...

def parse(self, x):
    """
    Parse an individual value from the input.

    :param str x: the value to parse.
    :return: the parsed value.
    """
    if isinstance(x, str):
        return ast.literal_eval(x)
    else:
        return x
```

This code first checks if the input `x` is a string, and if so, uses `ast.literal_eval` to directly parse the string. If the input is not a string, it is returned as is. This approach ensures that the parsing process is handled correctly for different input types.
