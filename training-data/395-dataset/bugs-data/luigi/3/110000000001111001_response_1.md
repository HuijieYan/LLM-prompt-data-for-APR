Potential error location: The potential error in the given function is that it tries to parse the input `x` as a tuple of tuples using `json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict)`. If this parsing fails, it then tries to parse the input using `literal_eval(x)`.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The given function is attempting to parse the input `x` as a tuple of tuples using `json.loads`. However, `json.loads` is meant for parsing JSON strings, and the input `x` might not always be a valid JSON string representing a tuple of tuples. This can lead to a `ValueError` when using `json.loads`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, we can handle the parsing directly for the given input `x` as a string representing a tuple of tuples using the `ast.literal_eval` method without relying on `json.loads`. 

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
import ast

def parse(self, x):
    """
    Parse an individual value from the input.

    :param str x: the value to parse.
    :return: the parsed value.
    """
    try:
        # parse the input string directly as a tuple of tuples using ast.literal_eval
        return ast.literal_eval(x)
    except (ValueError, SyntaxError):
        raise ValueError("Invalid input for parsing.")
```
In the corrected code, we removed the usage of `json.loads` and directly used `ast.literal_eval` to parse the input `x` as a string representing a tuple of tuples. We also added a handling for potential `ValueError` or `SyntaxError` that may occur during the parsing process.
