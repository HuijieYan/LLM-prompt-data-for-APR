Potential error location: The error seems to occur in the line `return tuple(tuple(x) for x in json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict))` within the `parse` function of the `TupleParameter` in the `luigi` module.

Reason for the bug: The code is trying to convert the input `x` to a tuple of tuples using the `json.loads` function. However, the input `x` is a string representation of a list `'[1, 2, 3]'`, and it is being directly processed as a tuple, which leads to the error.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We can modify the code to first convert the input string `x` into a list and then convert that list into a tuple. This will prevent the 'int' object not iterable error.

Corrected code:

```python
import json
import ast

def parse(self, x):
    """
    Parse an individual value from the input.

    :param str x: the value to parse.
    :return: the parsed value.
    """
    try:
        # Convert the input string x to a list and then to a tuple
        return tuple(json.loads(x))
    except ValueError:
        return literal_eval(x)  # if this causes an error, let that error be raised.
```
