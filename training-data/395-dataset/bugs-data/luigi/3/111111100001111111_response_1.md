Potential Error Location:
The error is likely occurring in the `parse` function within the `TupleParameter` class. Specifically, the line `return tuple(tuple(x) for x in json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict))` seems to be causing the error due to a TypeError.

Reasons for the Bug:
The error is occurring because the code is trying to convert `x`, which is a string representation of a list, into a tuple. This is being done using `json.loads`, which is resulting in the error. Additionally, the `tuple` function is being called on elements of `x` inside a nested list comprehension, which is not the correct approach.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use `ast.literal_eval` to safely evaluate the string representation of the tuple.
2. Ensure that the tuple conversion is done correctly to avoid the TypeError.
3. Catch both ValueError and TypeError to handle different scenarios and provide appropriate error messages.

Corrected Code:
```python
import json
import ast

# class declaration containing the buggy function
class TupleParameter(ListParameter):
    """
    Parameter whose value is a ``tuple`` or ``tuple`` of tuples.
    ...
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def parse(self, x):
        """
        Parse an individual value from the input.

        :param str x: the value to parse.
        :return: the parsed value.
        """
        try:
            # Safely evaluate the string representation of the tuple
            return ast.literal_eval(x)
        except (ValueError, TypeError) as e:
            # Handle both ValueError and TypeError and provide appropriate error messages
            raise ValueError("Failed to parse the input value: {}".format(str(e)))
