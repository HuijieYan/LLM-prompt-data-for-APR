The potential error location within the `TupleParameter` class is the `parse` method. Based on the traceback provided, the TypeError occurs at the line `return tuple(tuple(x) for x in json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict))`. This suggests that the issue lies in the way the `parse` method handles the input value `x`.

The bug occurs because the `parse` method does not handle the case where `x` is an integer, which leads to the TypeError when trying to iterate over it as a tuple. The `parse` method is attempting to convert the input value `x` into a tuple of tuples, but it is not accounting for the possibility that `x` might be an integer.

To fix the bug, the `parse` method should first check the type of `x` and handle the cases for both JSON strings and integers. If `x` is a JSON string, it should be processed using `json.loads`. If `x` is an integer, it should be converted into a tuple containing that integer.

Here's the corrected code for the `parse` method:

```python
def parse(self, x):
    """
    Parse an individual value from the input.

    :param str x: the value to parse.
    :return: the parsed value.
    """
    # Handling JSON string and integer cases
    if isinstance(x, str):
        # If x is a string, it might be a JSON string, so try to parse it
        try:
            return tuple(tuple(xx) for xx in json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict))
        except ValueError:
            # If parsing as JSON fails, attempt to parse it using literal_eval
            return literal_eval(x)
    elif isinstance(x, int):
        # If x is an integer, convert it into a tuple with that integer
        return (x,)
    else:
        # If x is neither a string nor an integer, raise an error
        raise ValueError("Unexpected input type for parsing: {}".format(type(x)))
```

With this corrected code, the `parse` method first checks the type of the input value `x` and then handles the cases for both JSON strings and integers accordingly. This should prevent the TypeError that was occurring previously.
