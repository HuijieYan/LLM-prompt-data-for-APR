The error is occurring in the `TupleParameter` class when the `parse` method is called with a tuple as input. The method is attempting to convert each element of the tuple to another tuple, leading to a "TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable" since tuple conversion is not applicable to non-iterable elements.

The error is likely occurring because the method is assuming that the input `x` is a JSON string that can be parsed into a tuple directly. However, when the `parse` method is called with a tuple as input, it tries to apply the `json.loads` and `object_pairs_hook` process inappropriately.

The potential approach to fix the bug is to first check the type of the input parameter `x`. If it is already a tuple, simply return it. If it is a string, perform the necessary parsing using the `json.loads(x)` and `ast.literal_eval(x)` functions. This will ensure that the method behaves correctly for both tuples and tuple strings.

The corrected code for the `parse` method is as follows:

```python
import json
import ast

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def parse(self, x):
    """
    Parse an individual value from the input.

    :param str x: the value to parse.
    :return: the parsed value.
    """
    if isinstance(x, tuple):
        return x  # if x is already a tuple, return it directly
    elif isinstance(x, str):
        try:
            # loop required to parse tuple of tuples
            return tuple(tuple(y) for y in json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict))
        except ValueError:
            return ast.literal_eval(x)  # if this causes an error, let that error be raised.
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Unsupported input type: {type(x)}. Expected type: tuple or str.")
