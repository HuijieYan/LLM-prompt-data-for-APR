The error occurs when the `TupleParameter().parse()` method is invoked with an input tuple. The problematic line is `return tuple(tuple(x) for x in json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict))` within the `parse` method. The error message `TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable` indicates that the code is attempting to iterate over an integer object, which is not iterable.

The reason behind the bug is that the `parse` method is trying to iterate over the elements of the input tuple `x`, which is unnecessary and leads to the TypeError. The `json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict)` returns a list of integers, and attempting to iterate over them as tuples causes the error.

The bug can be fixed by removing the unnecessary iteration over the elements of `x` and directly returning the result of `json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict)`. This will ensure that the parsed value is correctly returned without any unnecessary iterations or conversions.

Here's the corrected code for the `parse` method:

```python
def parse(self, x):
    """
    Parse an individual value from the input.

    :param str x: the value to parse.
    :return: the parsed value.
    """
    try:
        return json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict)
    except ValueError:
        return literal_eval(x)  # if this causes an error, let that error be raised.
```

This corrected code does not iterate over the elements of the input `x` and directly returns the parsed value after loading it using `json.loads` with the specified `object_pairs_hook`.
