Potential error location: The error occurs in the `parse` function when attempting to parse a tuple of tuples from the input `x`. The current code uses `json.loads` to parse the input, which may result in a `ValueError` if the input is not a valid JSON object. 

Reasons behind the bug: The code attempts to use `json.loads` to parse a tuple of tuples, which may not always result in a valid JSON object, leading to a `ValueError`. Additionally, the `object_pairs_hook` parameter is being used in `json.loads`, but it is not defined in the given code. 

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use `ast.literal_eval` instead of `json.loads` to parse the input, as `ast.literal_eval` is designed to safely evaluate an expression node or a string containing a Python literal or container display.
2. Handle the case where `x` is a tuple string, which may come from a config file or CLI execution.
3. Remove the undefined `object_pairs_hook` parameter from `json.loads` as it is not necessary in this context.

Corrected code:

```python
import json
import ast
from collections import OrderedDict

# this is the corrected function
def parse(self, x):
    """
    Parse an individual value from the input.

    :param str x: the value to parse.
    :return: the parsed value.
    """
    try:
        # try parsing using json.loads
        return tuple(tuple(y) for y in json.loads(x))
    except (json.JSONDecodeError, ValueError):
        # if parsing with json.loads fails, try parsing using ast.literal_eval
        return ast.literal_eval(x)
```
