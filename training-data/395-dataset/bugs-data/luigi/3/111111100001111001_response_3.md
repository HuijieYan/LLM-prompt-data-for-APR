The buggy function is trying to parse a string representation of a tuple into an actual tuple. The issue is that it's currently trying to use `json.loads` to do this, which isn't the correct approach.

To fix this, we can instead use the `ast.literal_eval` function, which safely evaluates an expression node or a string containing a Python literal or container display. This function will correctly parse the string representation of a tuple into a tuple.

Here's the corrected code for the `parse` function:

```python
import ast

def parse(self, x):
    """
    Parse an individual value from the input.

    :param str x: the value to parse.
    :return: the parsed value.
    """
    return ast.literal_eval(x)
```
