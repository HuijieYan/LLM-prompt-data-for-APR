The given test case is trying to test the `parse` function of the `TupleParameter` class. The input value for the `parse` function is a tuple `(1, 2, 3)` as a string, and the expected type is a string as well.

The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable` occurring in the `parse` function of the `TupleParameter` class in the `luigi/parameter.py` file.

The reason for this error is that the `parse` function tries to convert the input string into a tuple of tuples using `json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict)`. However, the input is not in a valid format to be parsed using `json.loads`, and it's a string representation of a list, not a tuple.

To fix this issue, you can handle the case of the input being a list-like string and convert it into a tuple. Then, the corrected code for the `parse` function should look like this:

```python
def parse(self, x):
    try:
        # Try to parse the string as a JSON
        return tuple(tuple(i) for i in json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict))
    except (ValueError, TypeError):
        # If parsing as JSON fails, handle it as a list-like string and convert it to a tuple
        return tuple(ast.literal_eval(x))
```

With this modification, the function first tries to parse the input string as JSON. If it fails, it handles the input as a list-like string and converts it into a tuple.

This change should resolve the `TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable` error.
