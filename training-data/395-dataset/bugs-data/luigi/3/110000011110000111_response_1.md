The test case provided is trying to use the `luigi.TupleParameter().parse()` method, which results in a TypeError.

The potential error location is within the `parse` method of the `luigi.TupleParameter` class. Specifically, the line `return tuple(tuple(x) for x in json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict))` is causing the TypeError.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `parse` method is trying to convert an integer value into a tuple, which is not possible.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `parse` method to handle the case where the input is an integer instead of a string. We can use the `literal_eval` function from the `ast` module to safely evaluate the input as a literal, without a risk of code injection.

Here's the corrected code for the `parse` method of the `luigi.TupleParameter` class:

```python
import json
import ast

def parse(self, x):
    try:
        # loop required to parse tuple of tuples
        return tuple(tuple(x) for x in json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict))
    except ValueError:
        try:
            return literal_eval(x)
        except (ValueError, SyntaxError):
            raise ValueError("Could not parse the input as a tuple.")
```

By using a nested `try-except` block, we first try to parse the input using `json.loads`, and if that fails, we attempt to use `ast.literal_eval`. If both of these fail, we raise a ValueError to indicate that the input could not be parsed as a tuple.
