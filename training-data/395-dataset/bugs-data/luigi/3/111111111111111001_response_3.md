The error occurs in the `parse` function of the `TupleParameter` class. The error message indicates that a `'int'` object is not iterable, which suggests that the `json.loads` function is returning an integer instead of a string or list, causing the subsequent `tuple(x) for x in json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict)` operation to fail.

This happens because the input `x` is not a valid JSON string, and the `json.loads` function is unable to parse it. As a result, the subsequent operation to convert it into a tuple fails.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `parse` function to handle the input `x` properly. Instead of attempting to parse `x` directly as JSON, we can first check if it is a valid JSON string. If it is, we can parse it using `json.loads`. If it's not a valid JSON string, we can then attempt to evaluate it using `ast.literal_eval`.

Here's the corrected code for the `parse` function:

```python
import json
import ast

class TupleParameter(ListParameter):
    # ... (other code)

    def parse(self, x):
        try:
            # Attempt to parse as JSON
            return ast.literal_eval(x)
        except (SyntaxError, ValueError):
            # If it's not a valid JSON string, try evaluating it
            return literal_eval(x)
```

With this correction, the function will first attempt to parse the input as JSON. If that fails, it will then try to evaluate it using `ast.literal_eval`. This approach ensures that the function can handle a wider range of input types and formats.
