The issue here is that in the provided buggy function, the `parse` function is attempting to parse a string value into a tuple. However, it's not clear why the `json.loads` and `ast.literal_eval` are used in the function.

The reason behind the bug could be that `ast.literal_eval` should be used to safely evaluate an expression node or a Unicode or Latin-1 encoded string containing a Python expression. In the given context, using `ast.literal_eval` would be a safer option for parsing the input.

A possible approach to fix the bug would be to remove the usage of `json.loads` and replace it entirely with `ast.literal_eval` as it's more suitable for the given use case.

Here's the corrected code for the `parse` function:

```python
import ast

def parse(self, x):
    """
    Parse an individual value from the input.

    :param str x: the value to parse.
    :return: the parsed value.
    """
    try:
        return ast.literal_eval(x)
    except (ValueError, SyntaxError):
        raise ValueError("Unable to parse the input value.")
```

In this corrected code, the `ast.literal_eval` function is used to directly parse the input `x` into a tuple. If there are any syntax errors or other issues with the input, it will raise a `ValueError` as specified in the except block.
