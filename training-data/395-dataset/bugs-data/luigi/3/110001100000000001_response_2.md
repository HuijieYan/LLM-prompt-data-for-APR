Potential Error:
The potential error in the given function is at the line "object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict", where "_FrozenOrderedDict" is not defined anywhere in the function. It is likely that "_FrozenOrderedDict" should be a defined object and is missing from the code.

Reasons for the Bug:
The code tries to use an undefined object "_FrozenOrderedDict" as the object_pairs_hook parameter for json.loads.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Define the "_FrozenOrderedDict" object or import it from a module if it is defined externally.
2. If "_FrozenOrderedDict" is not necessary, remove it and use the default behavior of json.loads.

Corrected Code:
```python
import json
import ast

def parse(self, x):
    """
    Parse an individual value from the input.

    :param str x: the value to parse.
    :return: the parsed value.
    """
    try:
        # loop required to parse tuple of tuples
        return tuple(tuple(x) for x in json.loads(x))
    except ValueError:
        return ast.literal_eval(x)  # if this causes an error, let that error be raised.
```
