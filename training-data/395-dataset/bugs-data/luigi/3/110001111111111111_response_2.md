The error "TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable" occurs when the `TupleParameter()` method tries to parse the input string. The issue arises because the `parse` method assumes that the input `x` will be a string representation of a tuple, but in some cases, it may receive a string representation of a list.

To fix this issue, the `parse` method needs to handle both string representations of tuples and lists. We can modify the method to check if the input can be parsed as a list, and if not, then parse it as a tuple.

Here's the corrected code for the `parse` method:

```python
import json
from ast import literal_eval

def parse(self, x):
    try:
        # Try parsing the input as a list
        return tuple(json.loads(x))
    except (ValueError, TypeError):
        # If it fails, parse it as a tuple
        return literal_eval(x)  
```

With this modification, the `parse` method will first attempt to parse the input string as a list using `json.loads(x)`. If that operation fails, it will then attempt to parse the input as a tuple using `literal_eval(x)`. This approach ensures that both representations are handled correctly.

After making this modification, it's essential to run the test cases again to ensure that the `TupleParameter()` method now works as expected.
