The error message "TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable" suggests that the issue is related to the iteration over the input `x` which is a tuple. In the `parse` method, the code attempts to iterate over the input `x` using `json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict)`. However, this raises a TypeError as it's trying to iterate over an integer object rather than a sequence (tuple).

To fix this issue, the `parse` method should handle the case where `x` is already a tuple, and for the cases where `x` is a string representation of a tuple, it should use the `literal_eval` method to safely evaluate it as a Python expression.

Here's the corrected code for the `parse` method:

```python
import json
from ast import literal_eval

class TupleParameter(ListParameter):

    # ... omitted code ...

    def parse(self, x):
        """
        Parse an individual value from the input.

        :param str x: the value to parse.
        :return: the parsed value.
        """
        # Check if the input is already a tuple
        if isinstance(x, tuple):
            return x

        try:
            # Attempt to parse the string representation of a tuple
            return literal_eval(x)
        except (ValueError, SyntaxError):
            # If literal_eval fails, it means the string is not a valid tuple format
            raise ValueError("Invalid tuple format: {}".format(x))
```

With this correction, the `parse` method first checks if the input `x` is already a tuple. If it is, it returns the input as is. If not, it attempts to parse the string representation of a tuple using `literal_eval`. If that also fails, it raises a `ValueError` with a suitable message.

This update should handle both cases where the input is a tuple and where it's a string representation of a tuple.
