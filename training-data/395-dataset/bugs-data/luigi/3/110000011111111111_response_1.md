The test case provided attempts to use the `luigi.TupleParameter().parse()` method to parse the input `'[1, 2, 3]'`, which is a string representing a tuple. The error message indicates a TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable, which suggests that there is an issue with iterating over the input.

The potential error location is within the `parse` method of the `luigi.TupleParameter` class.

The bug occurs because the `json.loads` method is being used to load the input string `x` and create a tuple from it. However, the input string `'[1, 2, 3]'` does not represent a valid JSON object, leading to the TypeError.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the input string is not a valid JSON object. We can achieve this by first attempting to parse the input using `json.loads` and then catching the `ValueError` if it occurs. If a `ValueError` is caught, we can then try to parse the input using `ast.literal_eval`.

Here's the corrected code for the `parse` method:

```python
import json
import ast

def parse(self, x):
    try:
        # Attempt to parse input using json.loads
        return tuple(tuple(x) for x in json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict))
    except ValueError:
        try:
            # If ValueError is raised, attempt to parse input using ast.literal_eval
            return ast.literal_eval(x)
        except:
            # If ast.literal_eval also causes an error, let that error be raised.
            raise
```

With this fix, the `parse` method will first attempt to parse the input using `json.loads` and if that fails, it will then try to parse the input using `ast.literal_eval`. This will ensure that the method handles both cases where the input string comes from a config file or from CLI execution.

This corrected code should resolve the TypeError issue and allow the `luigi.TupleParameter().parse()` method to work as expected.
