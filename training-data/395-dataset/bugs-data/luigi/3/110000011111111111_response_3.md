The error occurs in the `TupleParameter` class. The `parse` function is trying to convert the incoming string into a tuple, but an error is raised because it tries to iterate over an integer object, which is not iterable.

The reason for the bug is that the code in the `parse` function assumes that the input will always be a valid string representation of a tuple. However, when the input is actually an integer or a list, it causes a TypeError.

To fix the bug, a better approach is to check the type of the input before trying to parse it. If the input is a string, then proceed with the parsing logic. Otherwise, handle the other data types appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `parse` function:

```python
import json
import ast

def parse(self, x):
    """
    Parse an individual value from the input.

    :param str x: the value to parse.
    :return: the parsed value.
    """
    if isinstance(x, str):
        try:
            return tuple(tuple(x) for x in json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict))
        except ValueError:
            return literal_eval(x)  # if this causes an error, let that error be raised.
    else:
        # Handle non-string inputs
        if isinstance(x, (list, tuple)):  # Check if input is a list or tuple
            return tuple(x)
        else:
            raise ValueError("Input is not a valid tuple representation.")
```

By adding the check for the input type and handling non-string inputs appropriately, the function should now be able to handle various input scenarios without raising a TypeError.
