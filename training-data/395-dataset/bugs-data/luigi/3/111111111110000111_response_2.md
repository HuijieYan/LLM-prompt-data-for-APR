The error message indicates that the function `parse` in `TupleParameter` class is throwing a `TypeError: 'int' object is not iterable`.

Looking at the code, the potential error location is the line:
```python
return tuple(tuple(x) for x in json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict))
```

The reason for this bug is that the code is trying to iterate over `x`, which is an integer and not an iterable object. This line expects `x` to be a tuple or a list, and not an integer.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `x` is indeed a list or a tuple before attempting to convert it to a tuple.

Below is the corrected code for the `parse` function:

```python
def parse(self, x):
    """
    Parse an individual value from the input.
    
    :param str x: the value to parse.
    :return: the parsed value.
    """
    # Since the result of json.dumps(tuple) differs from a tuple string, we must handle either case.
    # A tuple string may come from a config file or from cli execution.

    # t = ((1, 2), (3, 4))
    # t_str = '((1,2),(3,4))'
    # t_json_str = json.dumps(t)
    # t_json_str == '[[1, 2], [3, 4]]'
    # json.loads(t_json_str) == t
    # json.loads(t_str) == ValueError: No JSON object could be decoded

    # Therefore, if json.loads(x) returns a ValueError, try ast.literal_eval(x).
    # ast.literal_eval(t_str) == t
    try:
        # loop required to parse tuple of tuples
        loaded_json = json.loads(x, object_pairs_hook=_FrozenOrderedDict)
        if isinstance(loaded_json, (list, tuple)):
            return tuple(tuple(item) for item in loaded_json)
        else:
            raise ValueError
    except ValueError:
        return literal_eval(x)  # if this causes an error, let that error be raised.
```

In the corrected code, we check if the `loaded_json` is a list or a tuple before converting it to a tuple inside the `parse` function. If it is not a list or a tuple, we raise a `ValueError` to handle the error case appropriately.
