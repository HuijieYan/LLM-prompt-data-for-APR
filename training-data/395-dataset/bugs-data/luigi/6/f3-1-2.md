Description
This recursively calls normalize on Mappings and lists when calling DictParameter.normalize. Also, makes OrderedFrozenDict and DictParameter.DictParamEncoder private, as requested by @Tarrasch.

Motivation and Context
Fixes issue #2094.

Have you tested this? If so, how?
Added a test, but am open to suggestions of better tests.
