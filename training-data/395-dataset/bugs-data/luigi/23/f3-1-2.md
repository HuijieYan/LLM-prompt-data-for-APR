The issue description is:

```text
Take these script: a main task that depends on a task that only completes successfully after some time has passed since launch

import time
import luigi

class DepThatNeedsSomeTime(luigi.Task):
    ready_time = luigi.FloatParameter()

    def run(self):
        assert self.complete()

    def complete(self):
        return  self.ready_time <= time.time()

class MainTask(luigi.WrapperTask):
    launch_time = luigi.FloatParameter(default=time.time())

    def requires(self):
        return [DepThatNeedsSomeTime(self.launch_time + 10)]

if __name__ == '__main__':
    luigi.run()
run it with these configs to simplify testing/debugging:

python script.py MainTask --scheduler-retry-delay 1 --worker-keep-alive
If you run this with central scheduler, the dependency will fail initially, but after some it will be retried because the server calls scheduler.prune every minute:

    # prune work DAG every 60 seconds
    pruner = tornado.ioloop.PeriodicCallback(scheduler.prune, 60000)
and scheduler.prune causes rescheduling/retrying of the failed task (through triggering SimpleTaskState.prune)

So eventually all work will be done successfully.

However if you run this with the local scheduler (additional --local-scheduler), you end up in an endless loop because scheduler.prune is never called and the failed task never gets a chance on a retry.

(FYI: I lost quite some time figuring all this out when I was examining the retry behaviour of Luigi with the local scheduler, assuming it would work the same as the central scheduler)
```
