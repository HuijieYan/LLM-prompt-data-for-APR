Potential error location:
The buggy function `create_local_scheduler` is trying to return an instance of `CentralPlannerScheduler`, which seems to be causing the issue related to task history when using the `--local-scheduler` option.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The current implementation of `create_local_scheduler` is not taking into account the need to disable task history for the local scheduler. It is trying to use the same configuration as the central scheduler, which is causing the issue.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `create_local_scheduler` function to include an option to disable task history for the local scheduler.
2. Add a new parameter to the `CentralPlannerScheduler` class to handle the task history behavior.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_17/luigi/interface.py

# class declaration containing the corrected function
class _WorkerSchedulerFactory(object):
    # ... omitted code ...


    # the corrected function
    def create_local_scheduler(self, disable_task_history=False): # Updated function signature with new parameter
        return scheduler.CentralPlannerScheduler(prune_on_get_work=True, disable_task_history=disable_task_history) # Pass the disable_task_history parameter to the scheduler instance
```
