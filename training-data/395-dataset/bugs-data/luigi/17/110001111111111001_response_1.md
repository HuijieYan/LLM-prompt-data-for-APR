The error message indicates that there is a "ModuleNotFoundError" for the module named 'sqlalchemy'. This error is occurring when the function `create_local_scheduler` is called from the `luigi.interface` module. It seems that the `sqlalchemy` module is missing or not properly installed, causing this import error.

To fix this issue, you need to install the `sqlalchemy` module. You can do this using the following command in the terminal:

```bash
pip install sqlalchemy
```

After installing the `sqlalchemy` module, the function should work without any issues.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_17/luigi/interface.py
from luigi.db_task_history import TaskHistory

def create_local_scheduler(self):
    return scheduler.CentralPlannerScheduler(prune_on_get_work=True, task_history=TaskHistory())
```

By including the `TaskHistory` class as an argument when creating the `CentralPlannerScheduler`, you ensure that the `sqlalchemy` module will be properly imported and used within the `TaskHistory` class.
