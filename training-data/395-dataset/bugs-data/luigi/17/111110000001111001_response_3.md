Potential error location:
The error is with the use of the `scheduler` module. It seems that the `scheduler` module is not imported or defined within the scope of the `_WorkerSchedulerFactory` class.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `scheduler` module is either not imported or not defined within the scope of the class, so calling `scheduler.CentralPlannerScheduler` will result in an error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Import the `scheduler` module at the beginning of the file.
2. If `scheduler` is a class within the same file, then make sure it is defined before the `_WorkerSchedulerFactory` class.

Corrected code:

```python
# Import the required module or class
import scheduler

# class declaration containing the fixed function
class _WorkerSchedulerFactory(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # the corrected function
    def create_local_scheduler(self):
        return scheduler.CentralPlannerScheduler(prune_on_get_work=True)
```
