The error message indicates that the `sqlalchemy` module is not found, which is likely causing the error when trying to create a local scheduler.

The potential error location within the `create_local_scheduler` function is the line that attempts to import `sqlalchemy`. This is likely the cause of the bug, as the `sqlalchemy` module is not available in the environment.

To fix the bug:
Approach 1: Install the `sqlalchemy` module in the environment where the function is being executed. This can be done using `pip install sqlalchemy` in the terminal or command prompt.

Approach 2: If installing `sqlalchemy` is not feasible, consider using an alternative method for creating the local scheduler that does not rely on `sqlalchemy`.

Here's the corrected code for the `create_local_scheduler` function:
```python
def create_local_scheduler(self):
    return scheduler.SOME_OTHER_SCHEDULER_CLASS_NAME
```
Replace "SOME_OTHER_SCHEDULER_CLASS_NAME" with the appropriate class or method name based on the desired alternative approach for creating the local scheduler.
