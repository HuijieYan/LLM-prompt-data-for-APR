The test case is attempting to create a local scheduler using the `create_local_scheduler` method of the `_WorkerSchedulerFactory` class from the `luigi.interface` module. However, the error message indicates that there is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for `sqlalchemy` when trying to use `luigi.db_task_history`.

The potential error location is within the `create_local_scheduler` method, as it seems to be attempting to use `luigi.db_task_history` which relies on `sqlalchemy`, which is not being imported or available.

The reason for this bug is that the necessary `sqlalchemy` module is not being imported in the `create_local_scheduler` method, causing the `ModuleNotFoundError` when attempting to use it.

To fix this bug, the `sqlalchemy` module needs to be imported within the `create_local_scheduler` method so that it is available for use.

Here's the corrected code for the `create_local_scheduler` method:

```python
class _WorkerSchedulerFactory(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def create_local_scheduler(self):
        import sqlalchemy  # import sqlalchemy module
        return scheduler.CentralPlannerScheduler(prune_on_get_work=True)
```

By importing `sqlalchemy` within the `create_local_scheduler` method, the `ModuleNotFoundError` should be resolved when attempting to create a local scheduler.
