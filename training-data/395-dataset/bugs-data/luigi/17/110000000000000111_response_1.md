Potential error location:
The error is likely occurring within the `create_local_scheduler` function where the `CentralPlannerScheduler` is being instantiated with `prune_on_get_work=True`. 

Reasons behind the bug:
The `CentralPlannerScheduler` constructor is being called with a parameter `prune_on_get_work=True`, which is likely causing the local scheduler to try to open the task history db file, leading to the issue described in the GitHub issue.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, the `CentralPlannerScheduler` constructor needs to be called with the correct parameters to disable the task history for the local scheduler when using `--local-scheduler`.

```python
# Fix for the buggy function
def create_local_scheduler(self):
    return scheduler.CentralPlannerScheduler(prune_on_get_work=False)
```

By setting `prune_on_get_work=False`, the task history will be disabled for the local scheduler, addressing the issue described in the GitHub issue.
