The bug occurs in the `create_local_scheduler` method of the interface.py file. The method is supposed to return a local scheduler, but it is currently returning a CentralPlannerScheduler instance, which is not the expected behavior for a local scheduler.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `create_local_scheduler` method to return a local scheduler instead of a CentralPlannerScheduler instance. We can achieve this by instantiating the LocalScheduler class and returning it from the method. The corrected code for the `create_local_scheduler` method is as follows:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_17/luigi/interface.py

# corrected function
def create_local_scheduler(self):
    return scheduler.LocalScheduler()
```
