The error message from the test function indicates that there is a `ModuleNotFoundError` for 'sqlalchemy'. This error occurs because the `CentralPlannerScheduler` class in the `luigi/scheduler.py` file is trying to import 'sqlalchemy' but it is not installed or available in the current environment.

To fix this issue:
1. The 'sqlalchemy' module needs to be installed in the environment where the 'luigi' package is being used. This can be achieved by running `pip install sqlalchemy` in the terminal.
2. Once 'sqlalchemy' is installed, the `CentralPlannerScheduler` class can successfully import and use it without any errors.

Corrected code for the problematic function `create_local_scheduler`:
```python
from luigi.scheduler import CentralPlannerScheduler

def create_local_scheduler(self):
    return CentralPlannerScheduler(prune_on_get_work=True)
```

After installing 'sqlalchemy' as mentioned above, this corrected code will allow the `create_local_scheduler` function to return an instance of `CentralPlannerScheduler` without encountering any import errors.
