The error message indicates that there is a 'ModuleNotFoundError' for 'sqlalchemy' when the function `create_local_scheduler` is called. This suggests that the 'sqlalchemy' module is not being successfully imported.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line where 'sqlalchemy' module is imported - `from luigi import db_task_history`. It seems that the required 'sqlalchemy' module is not being imported by the function properly.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is the missing import statement for 'sqlalchemy' module.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the 'sqlalchemy' module is properly installed and accessible. Then, update the import statement within the function to directly import 'sqlalchemy'.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_17/luigi/interface.py

# class declaration containing the buggy function
class _WorkerSchedulerFactory(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def create_local_scheduler(self):
        import sqlalchemy
        return scheduler.CentralPlannerScheduler(prune_on_get_work=True)
```
