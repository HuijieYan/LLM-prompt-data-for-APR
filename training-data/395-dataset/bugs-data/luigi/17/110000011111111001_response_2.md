The error message indicates a "ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'sqlalchemy'". This error occurs when the sqlalchemy module is not installed or cannot be found.

The potential error location within the `create_local_scheduler` function is the use of the `CentralPlannerScheduler` from the `luigi.scheduler` module, which requires sqlalchemy.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the sqlalchemy module is not installed in the environment or cannot be found when the function is executed.

To fix this bug, the sqlalchemy module needs to be installed in the environment where the `create_local_scheduler` function is executed. This can be done using a package manager such as pip: `pip install sqlalchemy`.

Here's the corrected code for the `create_local_scheduler` function:

```python
def create_local_scheduler(self):
    import sqlalchemy  # Add import statement here
    return scheduler.CentralPlannerScheduler(prune_on_get_work=True)
```

By adding an import statement for sqlalchemy within the `create_local_scheduler` function, the sqlalchemy module will be available when the function is executed. This should resolve the "ModuleNotFoundError" issue.
