The potential error location in the provided function is that it returns a `CentralPlannerScheduler` without any option to disable the task history for the local scheduler.

The reason behind the bug is that the local scheduler tries to open the task history db file even though it's not necessary or even exists for the local scheduler. This causes problems when using the `--local-scheduler` option, especially when working with a central scheduler that has its own task history configuration.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to add an option to disable the task history for the local scheduler. This can be achieved by adding a parameter to the `create_local_scheduler` function that allows the user to specify whether the task history should be enabled or disabled.

Here's the corrected code for the `create_local_scheduler` function:
```python
def create_local_scheduler(self, disable_task_history=False):
    return scheduler.CentralPlannerScheduler(prune_on_get_work=True, disable_task_history=disable_task_history)
```
In this corrected code, a new parameter `disable_task_history` is added with a default value of `False`. This allows the user to disable the task history for the local scheduler by passing `True` as the argument when calling the `create_local_scheduler` function.
