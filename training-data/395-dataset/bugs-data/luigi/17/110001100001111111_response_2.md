Potential error location: 
The issue seems to be related to the task history functionality of the local scheduler trying to access the task history file defined for the central scheduler, causing a problem when it doesn't exist.

Reason behind the bug:
The create_local_scheduler function is returning a CentralPlannerScheduler without providing an option to disable the task history, which is causing the local scheduler to try to access the task history file configured for the central scheduler, leading to errors.

Possible approaches to fix the bug:
1. Update the create_local_scheduler function to include an option to disable task history for the local scheduler.
2. Provide a configuration option for the local scheduler to disable task history independently from the central scheduler.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def create_local_scheduler(self, disable_task_history=False):
    return scheduler.CentralPlannerScheduler(prune_on_get_work=True, disable_task_history=disable_task_history)
```
