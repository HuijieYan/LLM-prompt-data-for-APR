The error occurs in the `create_local_scheduler` function, where it is returning an instance of `scheduler.CentralPlannerScheduler` instead of creating a local scheduler with the task history disabled.

The bug occurs because the `create_local_scheduler` function is creating an instance of the `CentralPlannerScheduler` instead of a local scheduler with task history disabled.

To fix the bug, we need to create a new class or function to represent a local scheduler with task history disabled. We can then return an instance of this class/function from the `create_local_scheduler` function.

Corrected function:
```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class _WorkerSchedulerFactory(object):
    # ... omitted code ...
    
    # corrected function
    def create_local_scheduler(self):
        return scheduler.LocalScheduler(disable_task_history=True)
```
