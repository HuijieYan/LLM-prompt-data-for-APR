Potential Error Location:
The buggy function is attempting to create a `CentralPlannerScheduler` without disabling the task history, which causes the local scheduler to try and open the task history db file.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because the local scheduler does not have an option to disable the task history when using `--local-scheduler`, which causes it to try and open the task history db file without checking its existence.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we can modify the `create_local_scheduler` function to include an option to disable the task history for the local scheduler.

Corrected Code:
```python
# Corrected function with option to disable task history
def create_local_scheduler(self, disable_task_history=False):
    return scheduler.CentralPlannerScheduler(prune_on_get_work=True, disable_task_history=disable_task_history)
```
