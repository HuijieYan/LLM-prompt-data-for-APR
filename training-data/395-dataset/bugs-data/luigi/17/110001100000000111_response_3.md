The problem with the `create_local_scheduler` function is that it always returns a `CentralPlannerScheduler`, which doesn't provide an option to disable task history for the local scheduler.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `create_local_scheduler` function to return a `LocalScheduler` object with the task history disabled.

Here's the corrected code for the `create_local_scheduler` function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_17/luigi/interface.py

from luigi.scheduler import LocalScheduler

# the corrected create_local_scheduler function
def create_local_scheduler(self):
    return LocalScheduler(prune_on_get_work=True, record_task_history=False)
```

With this change, the local scheduler will be created with the `record_task_history` option set to `False`, effectively disabling the task history for the local scheduler.
