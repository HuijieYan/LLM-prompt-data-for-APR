The error message indicates that there is a "ModuleNotFoundError" for the 'sqlalchemy' module. This module is likely being used in the `scheduler.CentralPlannerScheduler` constructor, which means the missing import is likely located in the `luigi.scheduler` module.

The reason for this bug is that the 'sqlalchemy' module is not being imported in the scheduler module, causing the `CentralPlannerScheduler` constructor to fail.

To fix this bug, the 'sqlalchemy' module needs to be imported in the `luigi.scheduler` module. This can be done by adding the following line at the top of the `luigi.scheduler` module:

```python
import sqlalchemy
```

This will ensure that the `CentralPlannerScheduler` constructor can successfully import the 'sqlalchemy' module and resolve the "ModuleNotFoundError" issue.

Here's the corrected code for the `create_local_scheduler` function:

```python
def create_local_scheduler(self):
    import sqlalchemy  # Import sqlalchemy module
    return scheduler.CentralPlannerScheduler(prune_on_get_work=True)
```
