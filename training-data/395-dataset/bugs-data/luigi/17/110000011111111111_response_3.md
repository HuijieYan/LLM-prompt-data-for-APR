The error message suggests that the `luigi` package is trying to import the `sqlalchemy` module, but it is not found. This is likely causing the error. The `CentralPlannerScheduler` class in the `luigi.scheduler` module seems to be importing `sqlalchemy` which is causing the error.

To fix this bug, one possible approach is to modify the `CentralPlannerScheduler` class to not require `sqlalchemy` when `prune_on_get_work` is set to `True`. Additionally, it might be helpful to provide a configuration option to disable the task history for the local scheduler.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def create_local_scheduler(self):
    return scheduler.CentralPlannerScheduler(prune_on_get_work=False)
```

In this corrected function, the `prune_on_get_work` parameter has been set to `False` to avoid importing `sqlalchemy` which causes the error. This will disable the task history for the local scheduler, addressing the bug.
