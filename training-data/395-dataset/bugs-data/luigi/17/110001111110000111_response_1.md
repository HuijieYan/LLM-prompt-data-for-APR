The error is occurring in the `create_local_scheduler` method, specifically when it tries to import the `sqlalchemy` module. The error message indicates a `ModuleNotFoundError` for the `sqlalchemy` module.

The reason behind this error is that the `sqlalchemy` module is not installed or available in the environment where the code is being executed. This module is required for the task history feature, but it seems that it is not available in the local environment.

One approach to fix this issue is to add a conditional check to disable the task history feature if `sqlalchemy` is not available. This will prevent the error from occurring when the local scheduler is created without the necessary modules.

Here's the corrected code for the `create_local_scheduler` method:

```python
def create_local_scheduler(self):
    try:
        import sqlalchemy
        return scheduler.CentralPlannerScheduler(prune_on_get_work=True)
    except ImportError:
        return scheduler.CentralPlannerScheduler(prune_on_get_work=False)
```

In this corrected code, we added a conditional check to first try importing the `sqlalchemy` module. If the import is successful, the task history feature is enabled. If the import fails (i.e., `sqlalchemy` is not available), the task history feature is disabled.

This approach ensures that the code does not break when the `sqlalchemy` module is not available, allowing the local scheduler to be created without the task history feature.
