Based on the GitHub issue title and description, it seems that the problem is related to the local scheduler attempting to open the task history db file that is defined for the central scheduler. This file may not exist, causing an issue when using the --local-scheduler option.

The buggy function "create_local_scheduler" is attempting to create a CentralPlannerScheduler without considering the option to disable task history for the local scheduler.

To fix this bug, the create_local_scheduler function should be updated to include an option to disable task history for the local scheduler. We can achieve this by adding a new parameter to the function and using it to conditionally create the scheduler with or without task history.

Here's the corrected code for the create_local_scheduler function:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class _WorkerSchedulerFactory(object):
    # ... omitted code ...


    # corrected function with an option to disable task history
    def create_local_scheduler(self, enable_task_history=True):
        if enable_task_history:
            return scheduler.CentralPlannerScheduler(prune_on_get_work=True)
        else:
            return scheduler.CentralPlannerScheduler(prune_on_get_work=True, record_task_history=False)
```

With this change, the create_local_scheduler function now accepts an optional parameter enable_task_history, which defaults to True. If enable_task_history is True, the scheduler includes task history, and if it's False, the scheduler is created without task history enabled. This provides the flexibility to disable task history for the local scheduler when using the --local-scheduler option.
