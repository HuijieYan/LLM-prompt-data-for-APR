Potential error location: 
The error could be occurring in the 'create_local_scheduler' method of the '_WorkerSchedulerFactory' class, as it seems to be instantiating a 'scheduler.CentralPlannerScheduler' object, but the 'scheduler' module has not been imported or defined within the class.

Reason for the bug:
The 'scheduler' module is being used within the 'create_local_scheduler' method without being properly imported or defined, leading to a NameError when the method is called.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Import the 'scheduler' module within the '_WorkerSchedulerFactory' class.
2. If the 'scheduler' module is not available, import it globally within the file where the class is defined.

Corrected code:
```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
import scheduler  # Import the 'scheduler' module

class _WorkerSchedulerFactory(object):
    # ... omitted code ...


    # The corrected function
    def create_local_scheduler(self):
        return scheduler.CentralPlannerScheduler(prune_on_get_work=True)
```
