The error occurs when the test case tries to create a local scheduler using the `create_local_scheduler` method of the `_WorkerSchedulerFactory` class. 

The potential error location within the `create_local_scheduler` method is the import statement `from luigi import db_task_history` which may be causing the `No module named 'sqlalchemy'` error.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `db_task_history` module makes use of SQLAlchemy, which is not imported or installed properly.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to ensure that SQLAlchemy is properly installed and imported in the `db_task_history` module.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class _WorkerSchedulerFactory(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # the corrected function
    def create_local_scheduler(self):
        from luigi.scheduler import CentralPlannerScheduler  # import the scheduler from the correct module
        return CentralPlannerScheduler(prune_on_get_work=True)
```
