The error message indicates that the 'sqlalchemy' module is not found, which is likely due to the missing import statement for 'sqlalchemy'. This import statement is missing from the 'luigi/scheduler.py' file where the CentralPlannerScheduler class is being initialized.

To fix this bug, you should import the required 'sqlalchemy' module in the 'luigi/scheduler.py' file. You can do this by adding the following import statement at the beginning of the 'luigi/scheduler.py' file:

```python
import sqlalchemy
```

This will resolve the 'ModuleNotFoundError' for the 'sqlalchemy' module.

Here's the corrected function with the import statement added:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class _WorkerSchedulerFactory(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def create_local_scheduler(self):
        import scheduler  # assuming 'scheduler' is the correct module to import
        return scheduler.CentralPlannerScheduler(prune_on_get_work=True)
```

By adding the correct import statement for the 'scheduler' module, you can fix the 'ModuleNotFoundError' issue.
