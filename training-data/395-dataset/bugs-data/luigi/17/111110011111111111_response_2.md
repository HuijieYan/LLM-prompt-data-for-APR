The error message indicates a ModuleNotFoundError for the 'sqlalchemy' module, which is being imported in the create_local_scheduler function. This means that the 'sqlalchemy' module is not installed in the environment where the code is running.

To fix this issue, you can either install the 'sqlalchemy' module in the environment or modify the create_local_scheduler function to not rely on the 'sqlalchemy' module if it's not strictly necessary for the local scheduler.

Here's the corrected code for the create_local_scheduler function without the dependency on 'sqlalchemy':

```python
class _WorkerSchedulerFactory(object):
    def create_local_scheduler(self):
        return scheduler.CentralPlannerScheduler(prune_on_get_work=True, record_task_history=False)
```

In this corrected code, the 'create_local_scheduler' method now includes an additional parameter 'record_task_history' set to 'False' by default in order to disable task history for the local scheduler. This should resolve the issue.
