    # This visualization let us know how the running-time of the specific task

# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
Disable Task History when using --local-scheduler
```

## The associated detailed issue description
```text
As you suggested in the docs, we use --local-scheduler only for testing purposes. Each member of our group works on his/her own computer (we have remote targets, so this setup works just great). Our central scheduler records the task history, as configured by our common luigi config file.

Now, the problem is that the local scheduler also tries to open the task history db file, that is defined for the central scheduler. This file does not necessarily exist. As you may guess, we don't want to maintain two separate config files ;)

It would be extremely helpful is there was an option to disable the task history for the local scheduler.
Any chance that a PR might be accepted ?
