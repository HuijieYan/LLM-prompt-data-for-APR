The error message indicates that there is a 'ModuleNotFoundError' for 'sqlalchemy' in the 'luigi/interface.py' file. This suggests that the 'sqlalchemy' module is not installed or accessible in the current environment.

The buggy function 'create_local_scheduler' is used to create a local scheduler and it seems to be trying to use 'sqlalchemy' which is not available, leading to the error.

To fix this bug, we need to make sure that the 'sqlalchemy' module is installed in the environment where this function is being called.

Here's the corrected code for the create_local_scheduler function:

```python
def create_local_scheduler(self):
    try:
        import sqlalchemy  # Check if sqlalchemy is available
    except ImportError:
        raise ImportError("The 'sqlalchemy' module is not available. Please install it.")

    # If sqlalchemy is available, return the scheduler
    return scheduler.CentralPlannerScheduler(prune_on_get_work=True)
```

With this correction, the function now checks if 'sqlalchemy' is available before creating the scheduler, and will raise an ImportError if it is not available. This ensures that the function will only attempt to create the scheduler if the required modules are accessible.
