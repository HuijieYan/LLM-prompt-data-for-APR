The bug occurs in the `create_local_scheduler` method of the `_WorkerSchedulerFactory` class. The method is currently creating an instance of `CentralPlannerScheduler` without providing any option to disable the task history for the local scheduler.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `create_local_scheduler` method to include an option to disable the task history. This can be achieved by adding a parameter to the method to specify whether the task history should be disabled or not.

Here's the corrected code for the `create_local_scheduler` method:

```python
class _WorkerSchedulerFactory(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def create_local_scheduler(self, disable_task_history=False):
        return scheduler.CentralPlannerScheduler(prune_on_get_work=True, disable_task_history=disable_task_history)
```

With this modification, the `create_local_scheduler` method now includes an optional parameter `disable_task_history` that defaults to `False`. When set to `True`, it will disable the task history for the local scheduler.

This will address the issue raised in the GitHub post about the need to disable the task history for the local scheduler when using `--local-scheduler`.
