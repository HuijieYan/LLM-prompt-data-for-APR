The error message indicates that the `sqlalchemy` module is not found, which leads to a `ModuleNotFoundError` when trying to create a local scheduler. This is likely because the `luigi.interface._WorkerSchedulerFactory().create_local_scheduler()` function is trying to use `sqlalchemy` internally, and it is not installed or imported properly.

To fix this issue, you can modify the `create_local_scheduler` function to not rely on `sqlalchemy`. Since we are creating a local scheduler, we can remove the need for database backend and task history feature. This will ensure that the local scheduler can be created without the dependency on `sqlalchemy` and task history.

Here's the corrected code for the `create_local_scheduler` function:

```python
def create_local_scheduler(self):
    return scheduler.SimpleScheduler()
```

In this corrected code, we replace the previous call to `scheduler.CentralPlannerScheduler` with `scheduler.SimpleScheduler`, which is a simple in-memory scheduler without any external dependencies like `sqlalchemy`. This will allow the local scheduler to be created without relying on database backend or task history.

With this change, the `create_local_scheduler` function will now return a `SimpleScheduler` suitable for local use, and the `ModuleNotFoundError` related to `sqlalchemy` should be resolved.
