Potential error location: The error seems to be related to the "scheduler" module not being imported correctly or not existing at all.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The module "scheduler" is either not imported or doesn't exist in the current context, causing the function to raise an error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Import the necessary "scheduler" module or use the correct module that provides the "CentralPlannerScheduler" class.

Corrected code:

```python
# class declaration containing the fixed function
import scheduler  # Assuming the module name is "scheduler"

class _WorkerSchedulerFactory(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def create_local_scheduler(self):
        return scheduler.CentralPlannerScheduler(prune_on_get_work=True)
```
