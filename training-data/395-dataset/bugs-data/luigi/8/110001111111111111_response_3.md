The error occurs because the SQL query in the `does_table_exist` function is comparing the table names in a case-sensitive manner, which is incorrect for Redshift because its schema and table names are case insensitive. Additionally, the `%s` string parameters in the query need to be surrounded with the `lower()` function to ensure case-insensitive comparisons.

To fix the bug, the SQL queries need to be updated to use case-insensitive comparisons by applying the `lower()` function to the table names.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where lower(table_schema) = lower(%s) and lower(table_name) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where lower(tablename) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```

With this correction, the queries now correctly use case-insensitive comparisons for the table and schema names. This should resolve the issue reported in the test case and the associated GitHub issue.
