The error message indicates that the SQL query in `S3CopyToTable.does_table_exist` is not matching the expected query. The expected query uses `lower(%s)` in the `where` clause to perform a case-insensitive comparison, while the actual query uses `%s` without the `lower` function.

The bug is occurring because the SQL query is not using a case-insensitive comparison for the table name and schema, which is needed for Redshift as schema and table names are case-insensitive.

To fix this bug, the SQL query needs to be updated to use `lower(%s)` for the table schema and table name comparisons. This will ensure that the comparisons are case-insensitive, as required by Redshift.

Here is the corrected version of the `does_table_exist` function:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where lower(table_schema) = lower(%s) and lower(table_name) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where lower(tablename) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```

In this corrected code, we have updated the query to use `lower(%s)` for the comparison of the table schema and table name, making the comparison case-insensitive as required for Redshift.
