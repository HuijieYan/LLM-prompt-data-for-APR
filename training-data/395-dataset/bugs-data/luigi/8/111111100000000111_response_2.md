The potential error location within the problematic function is in the query strings where the table names are being compared. Currently, the comparison is case sensitive, but it should be case insensitive for redshift schema and table names.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that Redshift schema and table names are case insensitive, but the comparison in the query string is case sensitive. This leads to incorrect determination of whether the table exists or not.

To fix the bug, the comparison in the query string should be made case insensitive by using the LOWER() function around the %s string parameters.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where lower(table_schema) = lower(%s) and lower(table_name) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where lower(tablename) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```
