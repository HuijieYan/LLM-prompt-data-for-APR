The bug occurs in the does_table_exist function where the comparison of table names is case sensitive, whereas Redshift schema and table names are case insensitive. This can lead to incorrect results when checking if the table exists.

To fix this bug, the %s string parameters in the query need to be surrounded with lower() to perform a case-insensitive comparison.

Here's the corrected does_table_exist function:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where lower(table_schema) = lower(%s) and lower(table_name) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where lower(tablename) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```
