The error is occurring in the `does_table_exist` function. The bug is that the function is performing case-sensitive comparisons for table names, even though Redshift schema and table names are case insensitive. 

To fix this bug, we need to update the queries in the function to perform case insensitive comparisons. We can achieve this by surrounding the `%s` string parameters with the `lower()` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `does_table_exist` function:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where lower(table_schema) = lower(%s) and lower(table_name) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where lower(tablename) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```

With this correction, the queries in the function will perform case insensitive comparisons for table names, addressing the bug.
