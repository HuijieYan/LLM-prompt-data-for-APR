The test case is checking the SQL query in the `S3CopyToTable.does_table_exist` method. The expected SQL query is using the `information_schema.tables` to check for the table's existence when the table name contains a schema, and the `pg_table_def` when it doesn't contain a schema.

The bug is that the method doesn't check for the presence of a schema in the table name while building the query. It always constructs the query to check for the schema in the table name, even when the schema isn't present.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to properly check for the presence of a schema and construct the SQL query accordingly.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    if '.' in self.table:
        schema, table_name = self.table.split('.')
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = %s and table_name = %s limit 1")
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        try:
            cursor.execute(query, (schema, table_name))
            result = cursor.fetchone()
            return bool(result)
        finally:
            cursor.close()
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where tablename = %s limit 1")
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        try:
            cursor.execute(query, (self.table,))
            result = cursor.fetchone()
            return bool(result)
        finally:
            cursor.close()
```
In this corrected code, we first check if the table name contains a schema or not. If it does, we split the schema and table name and construct the SQL query accordingly. If it doesn't, we directly use the table name to construct the query. This modification ensures the correct SQL query is used based on the presence of a schema in the table name.
