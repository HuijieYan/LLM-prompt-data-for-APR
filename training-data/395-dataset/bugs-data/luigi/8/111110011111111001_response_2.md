The test case is checking if the execute method on the cursor is called with the correct SQL query. The expected query has placeholders for string substitution (`%s`), while the actual query replaces the placeholders with the actual schema and table names. This indicates that the buggy function is not generating the SQL query correctly.

The bug in the function seems to be related to string formatting in the `query` string. The function is generating the SQL query based on the presence of a period in the table name, which seems to be causing issues.

To fix the bug, the function should use the correct SQL query based on the presence of a period in the table name. Additionally, it should use proper formatting for string substitution in the query as indicated by the test case.

Here's the corrected code for the `does_table_exist` function:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = %s and table_name = %s limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where tablename = %s limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        if '.' in self.table:
            schema, table_name = self.table.split('.')
            cursor.execute(query, (schema, table_name))
        else:
            cursor.execute(query, (self.table,))

        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```

With these changes, the function will correctly generate and execute the SQL query based on the table name. This should resolve the bug and allow the test case to pass as expected.
