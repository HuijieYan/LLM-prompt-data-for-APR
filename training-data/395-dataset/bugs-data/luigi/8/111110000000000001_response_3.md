The potential error in the `does_table_exist` function is in the construction of the SQL query depending on whether a table schema is included in the `self.table` attribute.

The bug occurs because the SQL query is using `table_schema` and `table_name` columns from the `information_schema.tables` table when a table schema is included in the `self.table`, but it should be using the `schemaname` and `tablename` columns instead. Additionally, the SQL query for when there is no table schema included is using `pg_table_def` instead of `pg_table_def` which is not a valid table.

To fix the bug, the SQL query for when there is a table schema in the `self.table` attribute needs to be corrected to use the `schemaname` and `tablename` columns. Also, the SQL query when there is no table schema should be modified to use the correct table `information_schema.tables`. 

Additionally, the `execute` method should pass the parameters as a tuple, even when there's only one parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the `does_table_exist` function:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where schemaname = %s and tablename = %s limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where tablename = %s limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        if '.' in self.table:
            cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        else:
            cursor.execute(query, (self.table,))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```
