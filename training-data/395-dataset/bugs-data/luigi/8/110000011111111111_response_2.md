The error occurs because the query in the `does_table_exist` function is not using the `lower()` function to make the comparison case insensitive.

The potential error location is within the `does_table_exist` function, specifically in the query construction.

The bug occurs because the SQL queries in the `does_table_exist` function are comparing table names in a case-sensitive manner. Redshift table names are case-insensitive, so the queries should use the `lower()` function to make the comparison case-insensitive.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the query construction to include the `lower()` function for case-insensitive comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `does_table_exist` function:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = lower(%s) and table_name = lower(%s) limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where lower(tablename) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```

In the corrected code, the `lower()` function has been added to the queries to make the comparison case-insensitive. This should fix the error encountered in the test function.
