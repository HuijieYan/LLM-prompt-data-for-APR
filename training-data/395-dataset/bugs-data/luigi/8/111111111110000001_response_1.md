The error occurs in the `assert_called_with` method of the mock object, specifically with the comparison of the expected and actual calls to `execute`. The issue is that the expected and actual SQL queries are different due to the table schema (`table_schema`) being represented differently in the two queries. This discrepancy is causing the assertion to fail.

To fix the bug, the `does_table_exist` method needs to be corrected to ensure that the SQL query string is properly assembled based on whether the table name includes a schema or not. The query for a table with a schema should reference the `information_schema.tables` and compare both the schema and table name. The query for a table without a schema should reference `pg_table_def` and only compare the table name.

Here's the corrected code for the `does_table_exist` method:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """
    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = lower(%s) and table_name = lower(%s) limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where tablename = lower(%s) limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        if '.' in self.table:
            schema, table_name = self.table.split('.')
            cursor.execute(query, (schema, table_name))
        else:
            cursor.execute(query, (self.table,))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```

With this correction, the `does_table_exist` method will properly construct and execute the SQL queries based on the presence of a schema in the table name. This should resolve the issue with the assertion in the test function.
