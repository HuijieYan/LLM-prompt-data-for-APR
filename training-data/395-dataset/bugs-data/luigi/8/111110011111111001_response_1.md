The test case calls the `does_table_exist` method of the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class and uses a mocked `cursor.execute` method to check if the correct SQL query is being generated. The error message indicates that the expected SQL query does not match the actual one.

Based on the input and expected output, it seems that the bug is related to the construction of the SQL query based on the `self.table` attribute.

The bug occurs because the query is constructed differently based on whether a dot ('.') is present in the `self.table` attribute or not. In the bug, the query does not use the `table_schema` and `table_name` as placeholders in the `information_schema.tables` case.

To fix this bug, the function should construct the query with placeholders in both cases and bind the values when executing the query.

The corrected code for the `does_table_exist` function is as follows:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = %s and table_name = %s limit 1")
        schema, table = self.table.split('.')
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where tablename = %s limit 1")
        schema, table = None, self.table

    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        if schema:
            cursor.execute(query, (schema, table))
        else:
            cursor.execute(query, (table,))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```
