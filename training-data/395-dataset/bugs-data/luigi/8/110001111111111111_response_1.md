The error message indicates that there is a mismatch between the expected and actual SQL query in the `does_table_exist` method of the Redshift module. The expected query should use the `lower()` function to make the comparison case insensitive, but the actual query does not.

The potential error location is in the `does_table_exist` method, where the SQL query is being constructed without using the `lower()` function to make the comparison case insensitive.

The reason behind the bug is that the method does not account for the case insensitivity of table names in Redshift, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual SQL queries.

To fix the bug, the SQL queries in the `does_table_exist` method need to be updated to use the `lower()` function to make the comparison case insensitive.

Here's the corrected code for the `does_table_exist` method:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = lower(%s) and table_name = lower(%s) limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where lower(tablename) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```

With these changes, the `does_table_exist` method now constructs the SQL query with the `lower()` function to perform a case insensitive comparison, addressing the bug identified in the GitHub issue.
