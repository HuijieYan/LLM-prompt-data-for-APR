Potential error location: The query selection is incorrect and may lead to a syntax error when executed.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug occurs because the query is not properly formatted for PostgreSQL.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Use the correct query format for checking table existence in PostgreSQL.
2. Use a try-except block to handle any potential errors that may occur during the query execution.

Corrected code:

```python
# Corrected function
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        if '.' in self.table:
            query = ("SELECT EXISTS ("
                     "SELECT 1 "
                     "FROM information_schema.tables "
                     "WHERE table_schema = %s AND table_name = %s"
                     ")")
            cursor.execute(query, (self.table.split('.')[0], self.table.split('.')[1]))
        else:
            query = ("SELECT EXISTS ("
                     "SELECT 1 "
                     "FROM information_schema.tables "
                     "WHERE tablename = %s"
                     ")")
            cursor.execute(query, (self.table, ))

        result = cursor.fetchone()[0]
        return result
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```
