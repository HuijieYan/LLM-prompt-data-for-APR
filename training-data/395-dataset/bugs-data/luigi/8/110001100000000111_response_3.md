The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of table names in the `query` string. The comparison is case sensitive, which is not suitable for Redshift, as its schema and table names are case insensitive.

The bug occurred because the comparison of table names in the query was case sensitive, which is not ideal for Redshift databases. The function should use case insensitive comparisons for table names.

To fix the bug, the %s string parameters should be surrounded with lower() to make the comparisons case insensitive.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_8/luigi/contrib/redshift.py

def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where lower(table_schema) = lower(%s) and lower(table_name) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where lower(tablename) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```
