Potential error location: The error may be occurring in the comparison of table names in the SQL queries, as Redshift schema and table names are case insensitive.

Reason behind the bug: The current function compares table names in a case-sensitive manner, which is not appropriate for Redshift databases. 

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use case-insensitive comparison for table names in the SQL queries.
2. Surround the %s string parameters with the lower() function to make the comparison case-insensitive.

Corrected code for the does_table_exist function:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where lower(table_schema) = lower(%s) and lower(table_name) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where lower(tablename) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```
