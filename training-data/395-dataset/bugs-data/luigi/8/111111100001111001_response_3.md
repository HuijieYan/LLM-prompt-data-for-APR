The bug is caused by the incorrect generation of the query string. The problematic function `does_table_exist` checks whether the table exists in the Redshift database based on the value of `self.table`. The bug is in the construction of the `query` string based on whether `.` exists in `self.table`.

It seems that the dot (`.`) should not be lower-cased in the query construction. It is assumed that `table_schema` and `table_name` in the `information_schema.tables` table should be case-sensitive.

To fix the bug, the `query` string generation needs to be modified to avoid lower-casing the string if `.` is present in `self.table`.

Below is the corrected code:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = %s and table_name = %s limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where tablename = %s limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table if '.' in self.table else [self.table]))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```
