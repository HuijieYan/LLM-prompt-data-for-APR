The bug is with the `query` assignment where the comparison of the table names is case sensitive. This is not suitable for Redshift as it treats schema and table names as case insensitive.

To fix the bug, the `%s` string parameters in the query need to be surrounded with `lower()` to make the comparison case insensitive.

The corrected code for the `does_table_exist` function is as follows:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = lower(%s) and table_name = lower(%s) limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where lower(tablename) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```
