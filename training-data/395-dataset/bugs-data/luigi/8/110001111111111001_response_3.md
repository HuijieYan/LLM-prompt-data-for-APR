The error occurs in the `does_table_exist` method of the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` class. The test case `test_s3_copy_to_table` checks if a specific SQL query is executed using `mock_cursor.execute.assert_called_with`. However, the SQL query in the test case does not match the one inside the `does_table_exist` method. This mismatch leads to an `AssertionError`.

The reason behind the bug is the incorrect SQL query comparison in the test case and the actual method. The query comparison is not consistent with the expected and actual SQL queries.

To fix the bug, the SQL query format in the `does_table_exist` method should be consistent with the comparison in the test case. Specifically, the queried database should be changed to `information_schema.tables` and the `table_schema` and `table_name` comparison should be adjusted accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `does_table_exist` method:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = lower(%s) and table_name = lower(%s) limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = 'public' and table_name = lower(%s) limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```

With this correction, the SQL query format inside the `does_table_exist` method aligns with the expected comparison in the test case, thereby resolving the bug.
