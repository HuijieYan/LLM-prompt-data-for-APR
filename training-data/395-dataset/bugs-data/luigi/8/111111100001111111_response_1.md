The potential error location within the `does_table_exist` function is in the `if` statement that checks if a '.' is present in `self.table`. 

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the comparison of table names in the query is case sensitive, while Redshift schema and table names are case insensitive.

To fix the bug, the `%s` string parameters in the query need to be surrounded with `lower()` to perform a case-insensitive comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `does_table_exist` function:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where lower(table_schema) = lower(%s) and lower(table_name) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where lower(tablename) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```

The corrected code adds the `lower()` function to the columns being compared in the query, making the table name comparison case insensitive, which resolves the bug.
