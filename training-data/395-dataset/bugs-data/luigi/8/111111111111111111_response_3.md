The error occurred because the SQL query in the `does_table_exist` function did not have the case-insensitive comparison for table names in Redshift. The `%s` string parameters also needed to be surrounded with `lower()` to enforce case insensitivity.

To fix the bug, we need to update the SQL query to include the `lower()` function for table names and schema names. This will ensure that the comparison is case insensitive.

Here's the corrected code for the `does_table_exist` function:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where lower(table_schema) = lower(%s) and lower(table_name) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where lower(tablename) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```

With these changes, the function should now perform the case-insensitive comparison for table names in Redshift, resolving the issue.
