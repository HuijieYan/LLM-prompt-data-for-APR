The test case is checking whether the `S3CopyToTable.does_table_exist` method is executing the SQL query correctly. This method is supposed to determine whether the table already exists in the database.

The bug seems to be related to the formation of the SQL query string inside the `does_table_exist` method. The input parameter `self.table` is expected to be split into schema and table name, and then used in the SQL query.

The bug is occurring because the query is formed differently based on whether the input table name contains a period ('.'). However, the expected test case is different, and it expects the query to always use the `%s` placeholders.

To fix this bug, we should remove the part of the code that differentiates between tables with schema and those without, and always use `%s` placeholders to make sure the query is consistent.

The corrected code for the `does_table_exist` method is as follows:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """
    query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
             "from information_schema.tables "
             "where table_schema = %s and table_name = %s limit 1")

    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```
