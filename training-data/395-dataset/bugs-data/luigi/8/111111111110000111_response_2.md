1. The test case `test_s3_copy_to_table` is checking if the SQL query in `S3CopyToTable.does_table_exist` is being called with the correct parameters. The error message indicates that the call to `mock_cursor.execute` is not as expected.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the construction of the SQL query in the `does_table_exist` method.

3. The bug occurred because the SQL query in the `does_table_exist` method is comparing table names in a case-sensitive manner. However, Redshift schema and table names are case-insensitive. The error message specifically mentions the need to surround the %s string parameters with `lower()` to make the comparison case-insensitive.

4. To fix the bug:
   - Modify the SQL query to use `lower()` around the %s string parameters to make the comparison case-insensitive.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
        """
        Determine whether the table already exists.
        """
    
        if '.' in self.table:
            query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                     "from information_schema.tables "
                     "where lower(table_schema) = lower(%s) and lower(table_name) = lower(%s) limit 1")
        else:
            query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                     "from pg_table_def "
                     "where lower(tablename) = lower(%s) limit 1")
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        try:
            cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
            result = cursor.fetchone()
            return bool(result)
        finally:
            cursor.close()
```
In the corrected code, the SQL query has been modified to use `lower()` around the %s string parameters, making the comparison case-insensitive as per the suggested fix.
