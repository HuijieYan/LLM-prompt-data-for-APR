The potential bug occurs in the if-else statement that sets the `query` variable. 
The buggy function `does_table_exist` is intended to determine whether a table already exists in a Redshift database. However, the query constructed in the `if-else` statement is using the `lower` function to lowercase the schema and table name for comparison. This could lead to incorrect results since the exact case of the schema and table name may not be represented accurately in the database.

To fix this bug, the `query` should be constructed in a way that it directly uses the schema and table names without altering the case.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("SELECT 1 AS table_exists "
                 "FROM information_schema.tables "
                 "WHERE table_schema = %s AND table_name = %s LIMIT 1")
    else:
        query = ("SELECT 1 AS table_exists "
                 "FROM pg_table_def "
                 "WHERE tablename = %s LIMIT 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```
