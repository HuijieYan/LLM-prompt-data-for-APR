The error message indicates that the SQL query in the does_table_exist function is not matching the expected query. The error specifically mentions that the comparison should be case insensitive and the %s string parameters need to be surrounded with lower().

The potential error location is within the does_table_exist function where the SQL query is being constructed.

The bug occurred because the SQL query was performing a case-sensitive comparison of table names in a case-insensitive environment.

To fix the bug, the SQL query should be updated to perform a case-insensitive comparison by surrounding the %s string parameters with lower().

Here's the corrected code for the does_table_exist function:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where lower(table_schema) = lower(%s) and lower(table_name) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where lower(tablename) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```

With these changes, the does_table_exist function should now perform a case-insensitive comparison of table names, resolving the bug.
