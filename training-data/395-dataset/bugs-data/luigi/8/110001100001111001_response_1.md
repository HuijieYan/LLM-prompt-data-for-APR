The error in the provided code is that the query is using the table_schema and table_name values directly without specifying the type (str). This is resulting in an error. Additionally, the pg_table_def table should be replaced with pg_table_def.

To fix this, we need to modify the query to include the placeholder %s for the table_schema and table_name values, and we should replace pg_table_def with information_schema.tables.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = %s and table_name = %s limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_name = %s limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```
