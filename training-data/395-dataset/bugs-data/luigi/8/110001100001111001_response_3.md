Potential error location: The query construction and execution within the `does_table_exist` method may be causing the issue.

Reason for the bug: The bug likely arises from the construction of the query using `table_schema = %s` instead of `table_schema = lower(%s)`. Additionally, the selection of the correct table name from `information_schema.tables` should be using lowercase comparison.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Modify the query to use `lower(%s)` for comparison with the table schema and lowercase comparison with the table name from `information_schema.tables`.

Corrected code:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = lower(%s) and lower(table_name) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where lower(tablename) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```
