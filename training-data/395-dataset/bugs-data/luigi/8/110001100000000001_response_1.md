Potential error location: The buggy function is likely to raise an error when trying to execute the SQL query, as it uses the wrong table name for the case when the table name contains a schema.

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs because the incorrect table name is used in the SQL query when the table name contains a schema.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the correct table name in the SQL query when the table name contains a schema.
2. Use try-except-finally blocks to handle any potential exceptions and ensure that the cursor is always closed.

Corrected code:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = %s and table_name = %s limit 1")
        schema, table_name = self.table.split('.')
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where tablename = %s limit 1")
        table_name = self.table
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        if '.' in self.table:
            cursor.execute(query, (schema, table_name))
        else:
            cursor.execute(query, (table_name,))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```
