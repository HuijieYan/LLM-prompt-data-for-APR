The buggy function `does_table_exist` is designed to check whether a table already exists in a database. The bug in this function is the incorrect query construction based on the presence of a schema in the table name.

The bug is caused by the incorrect construction of the query when the table name contains a schema (e.g., 'schema.table'). The function mistakenly attempts to use `pg_table_def` for checking the existence of the table when a schema is present, instead of using the `information_schema.tables`.

To fix this bug, the function needs to correctly construct the query based on the presence of the schema in the table name and execute it accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `does_table_exist` function:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        if '.' in self.table:
            query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                     "from information_schema.tables "
                     "where table_schema = %s and table_name = %s limit 1")
            cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        else:
            query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                     "from pg_table_def "
                     "where tablename = %s limit 1")
            cursor.execute(query, (self.table,))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```

In the corrected code, the `query` is constructed based on the presence of the schema in the table name. The query is then executed using the correct table information method, and the result is returned as expected.
