The potential error in the provided does_table_exist function is that the queries for table existence checks are case sensitive, which is not suitable for Redshift as it treats table names as case insensitive.

To fix the bug, the %s string parameters need to be surrounded with the lower() function to make the table name comparison case insensitive.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where lower(table_schema) = lower(%s) and lower(table_name) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where lower(tablename) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```
