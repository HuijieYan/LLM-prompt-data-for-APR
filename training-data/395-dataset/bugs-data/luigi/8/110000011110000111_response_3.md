1. The test case calls the `does_table_exist` method with a schema-qualified table name, and then asserts that the SQL query executed in the method matches a specific format.

2. The potential error location is the SQL query in the `does_table_exist` method, specifically in the `if '.' in self.table` block.

3. The reason behind the bug is that the SQL query in the `if '.' in self.table` block does not use the `lower()` function to make the comparison case-insensitive. This leads to a mismatch between the expected and actual SQL queries when the test case is executed.

4. The bug can be fixed by modifying the SQL query in the `if '.' in self.table` block to include the `lower()` function for case-insensitive comparison of table names.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = lower(%s) and table_name = lower(%s) limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where tablename = lower(%s) limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```

In the corrected code, the SQL query in the `if '.' in self.table` block includes the `lower()` function to make the comparisons case-insensitive, which addresses the bug identified in the issue description.
