The error occurs when the `test_s3_copy_to_table` test function calls the `mock_cursor.execute.assert_called_with` method to verify the execute method is called with the correct query and parameters. The actual query in the error message does not match the expected query because of the incorrect handling of the table schema.

The bug occurs in the `does_table_exist` method when constructing the query to check if the table exists. The issue arises from the way the `table_schema` is handled when constructing the SQL query. The schema should be passed as a string without being converted to lowercase.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be updated to ensure the schema is handled correctly in the SQL query.

Here's the corrected method:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = %s and table_name = %s limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where tablename = %s limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        if '.' in self.table:
            cursor.execute(query, (self.table.split('.')[0], self.table.split('.')[1]))
        else:
            cursor.execute(query, (self.table,))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```

In this corrected code, the relevant SQL query is constructed with the correct handling of the schema name, and the query parameters are passed accordingly. This should resolve the bug and make the test pass successfully.
