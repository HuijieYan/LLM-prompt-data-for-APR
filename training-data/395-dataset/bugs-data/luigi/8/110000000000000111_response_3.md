Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the comparison of table names in the query string.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug is occurring because the comparison of table names in the query string is case sensitive, while Redshift schema and table names are case insensitive.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Surround the %s string parameters with lower() to ensure case insensitive comparisons.
2. Modify the query string to use case insensitive comparisons for table names.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where lower(table_schema) = lower(%s) and lower(table_name) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where lower(tablename) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
