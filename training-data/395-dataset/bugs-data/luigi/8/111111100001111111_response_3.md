The bug in the provided function does_table_exist() is that it performs a case-sensitive comparison for table names in Redshift, even though Redshift schema and table names are case-insensitive. The bug can lead to incorrect results when checking for the existence of a table in Redshift.

To fix the bug, the %s string parameters in the SQL query should be surrounded with lower() to make the comparisons case-insensitive.

Here's the corrected code for the does_table_exist() function:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = lower(%s) and table_name = lower(%s) limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where lower(tablename) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```

This code surrounds the %s string parameters with lower() to make the comparisons case-insensitive, addressing the bug mentioned in the GitHub issue.
