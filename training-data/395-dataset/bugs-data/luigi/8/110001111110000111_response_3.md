1. The test case is checking the SQL query in `S3CopyToTable.does_table_exist` to see if it is being executed correctly. The error message indicates that the expected SQL query is different from the actual one being executed.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the construction of the SQL query in the `does_table_exist` method.

3. The bug is occurring because the SQL queries in the `does_table_exist` method compare the table names in a case-sensitive manner. Redshift schema and table names are case insensitive, so the comparisons should be updated to be case insensitive as well.

4. To fix the bug, we need to update the SQL query to surround the `%s` string parameters with `lower()` to make the comparisons case insensitive.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `does_table_exist` method:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = lower(%s) and table_name = lower(%s) limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where tablename = lower(%s) limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```
