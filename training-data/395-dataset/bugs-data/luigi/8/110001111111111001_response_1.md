The error message indicates that the `mock_cursor.execute` call is not matching the expected call. The expected call specifies using `lower(%s)` in the query string, but the actual call uses `%s` directly in the query string.

The potential error location is within the `does_table_exist` function where the `query` is constructed based on whether `.` is present in `self.table`.

The bug occurs because the query construction uses `information_schema.tables` or `pg_table_def` based on the presence of `.` in `self.table`, but the logic to replace `%s` with `lower(%s)` is not implemented properly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the construction of the `query` to incorporate the usage of `lower(%s)` based on the presence of `.` in `self.table`. Additionally, the `execute` call should be corrected to match the expected query structure.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = lower(%s) and table_name = lower(%s) limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where tablename = lower(%s) limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```

With these changes, the `query` and `execute` calls in the function should correctly handle the presence of `.` in `self.table`.
