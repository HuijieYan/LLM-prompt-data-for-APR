The error message indicates that the expected SQL query in the test function does not match the actual executed query in the `does_table_exist` method. The expected query should match the actual query to pass the assertion.

The potential error location within the `does_table_exist` method is the construction of the SQL query based on the existence of a dot ('.') in the table name.

The bug occurs because the SQL query construction does not consider whether the table name contains a schema or not. The query should be constructed based on whether the table name contains a schema or not.

To fix the bug, the SQL query construction logic in the `does_table_exist` method should consider the existence of a schema in the table name. If a schema is present, it should construct the query using the `information_schema.tables` table, and if not, it should use the `pg_table_def` table.

Here's the corrected function for `does_table_exist`:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = %s and table_name = %s limit 1")
        schema, table_name = self.table.split('.')
        cursor.execute(query, (schema, table_name))
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where tablename = %s limit 1")
        cursor.execute(query, (self.table,))
    result = cursor.fetchone()
    return bool(result)
```

This corrected version handles the case where the table name contains a schema and constructs the SQL query accordingly.
