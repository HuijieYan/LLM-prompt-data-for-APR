The potential error is occurring because the query might not be correctly formatted based on the table name. The bug in the code is the handling of the table name in the query based on the presence of a schema delimiter '.'. It's always converting the table name to lowercase when the schema delimiter is present, which may not be correct in all cases.

To fix the bug, the table name should be handled based on the presence of a schema delimiter, and the query should be constructed accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `does_table_exist` function:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    table_parts = self.table.split('.')
    if len(table_parts) > 1:
        schema, table_name = table_parts
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = %s and table_name = %s limit 1")
    else:
        table_name = self.table
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where tablename = %s limit 1")

    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, (schema.lower(), table_name.lower()) if len(table_parts) > 1 else (table_name.lower(),))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```

This code ensures that the schema and table name are handled correctly and the query is constructed based on the presence of a schema delimiter in the table name.
