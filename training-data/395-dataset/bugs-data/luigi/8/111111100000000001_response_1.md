The potential error location within the `does_table_exist` function is in the construction of the SQL query. Depending on whether there is a period (.) in the `self.table` attribute, the function constructs a different SQL query. However, in the case where there is a period in `self.table`, the SQL query is referencing the `pg_table_def` table, which does not exist in Redshift. This will cause the function to fail.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the query to reference the correct table based on the presence of a period in `self.table`. For tables with a period, the `information_schema.tables` table should be used. For tables without a period, the `pg_table_def` table can be replaced with the correct table that exists in Redshift.

Below is the corrected code for the `does_table_exist` function:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = %s and table_name = %s limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_name = %s limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        if '.' in self.table:
            cursor.execute(query, (self.table.split('.')[0], self.table.split('.')[1]))
        else:
            cursor.execute(query, (self.table,))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```

In the corrected code, the SQL query is changed to ensure that the correct tables are referenced based on the presence of a period in `self.table`. Additionally, the parameter passed to `cursor.execute` is modified to match the query format.
