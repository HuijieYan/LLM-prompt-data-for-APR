The error occurs because the comparison between the expected and actual calls to `mock_cursor.execute` does not match. The expected query is different from the actual query, which results in an assertion error.

The bug is in the `does_table_exist` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class. The problem lies in the construction of the query based on the presence of a '.' in the table name. The original code constructs the SQL query using the `information_schema.tables` when a '.' is present in the table name, which is not the correct approach.

To fix the bug, we need to update the query construction logic to handle both the cases correctly, i.e., when a '.' is present and when it's not. Below is the corrected code for the `does_table_exist` method:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("SELECT 1 AS table_exists "
                 "FROM information_schema.tables "
                 "WHERE table_schema = %s AND table_name = %s")
    else:
        query = ("SELECT 1 AS table_exists "
                 "FROM information_schema.tables "
                 "WHERE table_schema = current_schema() "
                 "AND table_name = %s")

    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```

In the corrected code, the query construct has been updated to handle both the cases of the presence and absence of '.' in the table name correctly. This should resolve the bug, and the test case should pass without assertion errors.
