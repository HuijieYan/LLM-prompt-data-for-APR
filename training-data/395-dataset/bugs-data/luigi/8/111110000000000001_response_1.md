Potential error location: The error is likely to be in the query construction part of the function, where the SQL query is being built based on whether the table name contains a dot or not.

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs because the SQL query is not formatted correctly based on whether the table name contains a dot or not.

Approach to fixing the bug: We need to modify the way the query is constructed based on whether the table name contains a dot or not. Additionally, we also need to handle the case where `pg_table_def` is used to check table existence, as `information_schema.tables` is the more reliable approach.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        schema_name, table_name = self.table.split('.')
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = %s and table_name = %s limit 1")
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        try:
            cursor.execute(query, (schema_name, table_name))
            result = cursor.fetchone()
            return bool(result)
        finally:
            cursor.close()
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = 'public' and table_name = %s limit 1")
        cursor = connection.cursor()
        try:
            cursor.execute(query, (self.table,))
            result = cursor.fetchone()
            return bool(result)
        finally:
            cursor.close()
```
