Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the query construction and execution part of the does_table_exist function, specifically in the comparison of table names.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug is likely occurring because the function is comparing table names in a case-sensitive manner, while Redshift schema and table names are case insensitive.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, the query needs to be updated to compare table names in a case-insensitive manner by using lower() around the %s string parameters.

Corrected code:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where lower(table_schema) = lower(%s) and lower(table_name) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where lower(tablename) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```
