1. The test case calls the `does_table_exist` method on the `S3CopyToTable` class and checks if the SQL query is being executed correctly. The error message highlights that the SQL query is not being executed as expected, indicating an issue within the `does_table_exist` method.

2. The potential error location is within the `does_table_exist` function where the SQL query is being constructed and executed based on the table name and schema.

3. The reason behind the bug is that the SQL queries compare the table names in a case-sensitive manner, while Redshift schema and table names are case-insensitive. This leads to incorrect comparison of table names and causes the test case to fail.

4. To fix the bug, the %s string parameters in the SQL queries need to be surrounded with `lower()` to perform case insensitive comparisons of the schema and table names.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where table_schema = lower(%s) and table_name = lower(%s) limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where tablename = lower(%s) limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```

In the corrected code, the affected %s string parameters in the SQL queries have been surrounded with `lower()` to perform case-insensitive comparisons of the schema and table names. This fix addresses the issue identified in the bug report and should resolve the error.
