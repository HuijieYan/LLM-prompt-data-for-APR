The error occurs because the SQL query in the `does_table_exist` function is not handling the schema and table names correctly. It is comparing the table names in a case-sensitive manner, which is not appropriate for Redshift since schema and table names are case-insensitive.

To fix the bug, the %s string parameters in the SQL query need to be surrounded with lower() to make the comparisons case-insensitive.

Here's the corrected code for the `does_table_exist` function:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """

    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where lower(table_schema) = lower(%s) and lower(table_name) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where lower(tablename) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```
