The error occurs in the query construction within the does_table_exist function. The query is not case insensitive, which causes issues with Redshift schema and table names as they are case insensitive.

To fix the bug, we need to surround the %s string parameters with the lower() function to make the comparisons case insensitive.

Here's the corrected code for the does_table_exist function:

```python
def does_table_exist(self, connection):
    """
    Determine whether the table already exists.
    """
    if '.' in self.table:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from information_schema.tables "
                 "where lower(table_schema) = lower(%s) and lower(table_name) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    else:
        query = ("select 1 as table_exists "
                 "from pg_table_def "
                 "where lower(tablename) = lower(%s) limit 1")
    cursor = connection.cursor()
    try:
        cursor.execute(query, tuple(self.table.split('.')))
        result = cursor.fetchone()
        return bool(result)
    finally:
        cursor.close()
```
