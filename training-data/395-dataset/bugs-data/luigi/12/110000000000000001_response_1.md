Potential Error:
The potential error in the provided function is that the `configured_client` variable is being compared to strings "webhdfs", "snakebite", "snakebite_with_hadoopcli_fallback", and "hadoopcli". However, the `configured_client` variable is not assigned any value within the function, so the comparisons will always fail, and the function will always raise an exception.

Reason for the Bug:
The `configured_client` variable is not being initialized within the function, so the comparisons to specific client types will always fail.

Possible Approach to Fix the Bug:
We need to retrieve the actual value of the `configured_client` from the `luigi.cfg` configuration file or some other configuration source. Once we have the actual value, we can then perform the comparisons and instantiate the appropriate client.

Corrected Code:
```python
# corrected function
def get_autoconfig_client(configured_client):
    """
    Creates the client as specified in the `luigi.cfg` configuration.
    """
    if configured_client == "webhdfs":
        return hdfs_webhdfs_client.WebHdfsClient()
    if configured_client == "snakebite":
        return hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient()
    if configured_client == "snakebite_with_hadoopcli_fallback":
        return luigi.contrib.target.CascadingClient([hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient(),
                                                     hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()])
    if configured_client == "hadoopcli":
        return hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()
    raise Exception("Unknown hdfs client " + configured_client)
```
In the corrected code, the `get_autoconfig_client` function now takes the `configured_client` as a parameter, which should be retrieved from the configuration. The function then compares this value to the specified client types and returns the appropriate client instance.
