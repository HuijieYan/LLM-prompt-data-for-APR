The bug in the code seems to be related to the `get_autoconfig_client` function, specifically in the way it handles the `configured_client` variable.

The provided error messages suggest that the `configured_client` might not be getting set correctly based on the input parameters, and this is causing the function to return unexpected results.

One potential reason for this bug could be that the `hdfs_config.get_configured_hdfs_client()` is not returning the expected value, or the comparison in the if statements is not working as intended.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to ensure that the `configured_client` is correctly identified and handled. Here's the corrected code for the `get_autoconfig_client` function:

```python
def get_autoconfig_client():
    """
    Creates the client as specified in the `luigi.cfg` configuration.
    """
    configured_client = hdfs_config.get_configured_hdfs_client()
    if configured_client == "webhdfs":
        return hdfs_webhdfs_client.WebHdfsClient()
    elif configured_client == "snakebite":
        return hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient()
    elif configured_client == "snakebite_with_hadoopcli_fallback":
        return luigi.contrib.target.CascadingClient([hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient(),
                                                     hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()])
    elif configured_client == "hadoopcli":
        return hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()
    else:
        raise Exception("Unknown hdfs client " + configured_client)
```

In this corrected code, I have replaced the individual `if` statements with `elif` statements. This ensures that only one block of code is executed based on the value of `configured_client`. Additionally, I have added an `else` block to handle the case where `configured_client` does not match any of the expected values.

This should fix the bug and ensure that the correct client is returned based on the configuration.
