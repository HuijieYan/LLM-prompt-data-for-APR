The error message indicates that the original_client and get_autoconfig_client() are not the same object, even though they should be according to the test assertion. This suggests that the get_autoconfig_client() function is not returning the same client instance.

The potential error location within the get_autoconfig_client() function is the conditions used to determine which client to return based on the configured client value. 

The bug is occurring because the get_autoconfig_client() function is not returning the same client instance when called multiple times.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to return the same client instance for each configured client type. We can create class-level variables to store instances of each client type and return the same instance for the same client type.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class AutoConfigClient:
    webhdfs_client = None
    snakebite_client = None
    snakebite_with_hadoopcli_client = None
    hadoopcli_client = None
    
    @classmethod
    def get_autoconfig_client(cls):
        """
        Creates the client as specified in the `luigi.cfg` configuration.
        """
        configured_client = hdfs_config.get_configured_hdfs_client()
        
        if configured_client == "webhdfs":
            if cls.webhdfs_client is None:
                cls.webhdfs_client = hdfs_webhdfs_client.WebHdfsClient()
            return cls.webhdfs_client
        
        if configured_client == "snakebite":
            if cls.snakebite_client is None:
                cls.snakebite_client = hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient()
            return cls.snakebite_client
        
        if configured_client == "snakebite_with_hadoopcli_fallback":
            if cls.snakebite_with_hadoopcli_client is None:
                cls.snakebite_with_hadoopcli_client = luigi.contrib.target.CascadingClient([hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient(),
                                                            hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()])
            return cls.snakebite_with_hadoopcli_client
            
        if configured_client == "hadoopcli":
            if cls.hadoopcli_client is None:
                cls.hadoopcli_client = hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()
            return cls.hadoopcli_client
        
        raise Exception("Unknown hdfs client " + configured_client)
```

By using class-level variables to store instances of each client type, the corrected function ensures that the same client instance is returned for the same configured client type. This should address the issue identified in the error message.
