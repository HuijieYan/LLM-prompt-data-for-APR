The test case `test_get_autoconfig_client_cached` is checking whether the `get_autoconfig_client()` function returns the same client object when called multiple times. However, the test is failing with an assertion error, indicating that the client objects are not the same.

The potential error location in the `get_autoconfig_client()` function is the logic for creating and returning different client objects based on the configured client type.

The reason behind the bug is that the function is not returning the same client object when called multiple times, even though it should return the same cached client object.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to create and cache the client object using the client_cache, and return the cached client object instead of creating a new one each time the function is called.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_autoconfig_client()` function:

```python
import threading

client_cache = threading.local()

def get_autoconfig_client():
    """
    Creates the client as specified in the `luigi.cfg` configuration.
    """
    if not hasattr(client_cache, 'client'):
        configured_client = hdfs_config.get_configured_hdfs_client()
        if configured_client == "webhdfs":
            client_cache.client = hdfs_webhdfs_client.WebHdfsClient()
        elif configured_client == "snakebite":
            client_cache.client = hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient()
        elif configured_client == "snakebite_with_hadoopcli_fallback":
            client_cache.client = luigi.contrib.target.CascadingClient([hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient(),
                                                     hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()])
        elif configured_client == "hadoopcli":
            client_cache.client = hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()
        else:
            raise Exception("Unknown hdfs client " + configured_client)

    return client_cache.client
```

With this modification, the `get_autoconfig_client()` function will cache the client object in the `client_cache` and return the cached client object on subsequent calls. This should resolve the error in the test case.
