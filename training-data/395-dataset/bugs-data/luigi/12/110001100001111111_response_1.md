The bug seems to be related to the instantiation of a large number of HdfsTargets using the `luigi.contrib.hdfs.HdfsTarget` and `luigi.contrib.hdfs.hadoopcli_clients.HdfsClient` classes. The issue arises when using a list comprehension to instantiate a large number of objects, causing the program to fail after a certain threshold.

The `get_autoconfig_client` function is being called when instantiating the `AutoConfigClient` and we can see that it's returning different client objects each time it's called. This can potentially cause memory issues and lead to failures when a large number of clients are instantiated.

To fix this bug, the `get_autoconfig_client` function should return the same client object each time it's called. This can help prevent memory issues when dealing with a large number of client objects.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_autoconfig_client` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def get_autoconfig_client():
    """
    Creates the client as specified in the `luigi.cfg` configuration.
    """
    if hasattr(get_autoconfig_client, "_client_instance"):
        return get_autoconfig_client._client_instance
    
    configured_client = hdfs_config.get_configured_hdfs_client()
    if configured_client == "webhdfs":
        client = hdfs_webhdfs_client.WebHdfsClient()
    elif configured_client == "snakebite":
        client = hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient()
    elif configured_client == "snakebite_with_hadoopcli_fallback":
        client = luigi.contrib.target.CascadingClient([hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient(),
                                                     hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()])
    elif configured_client == "hadoopcli":
        client = hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()
    else:
        raise Exception("Unknown hdfs client " + configured_client)
    
    get_autoconfig_client._client_instance = client
    return client
```

In the corrected code, the function checks if the client instance already exists and returns the same instance if it does. This ensures that the same client object is returned every time the function is called, preventing memory issues when dealing with a large number of client objects.
