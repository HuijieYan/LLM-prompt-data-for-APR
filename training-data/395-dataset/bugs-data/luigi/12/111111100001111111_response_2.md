The error seems to be related to the `get_autoconfig_client` function, specifically with the creation of multiple instances of the HDFS client leading to a failure when a large number of targets are instantiated.

The potential error location within the function is the creation of new instances of the HDFS client every time the function is called.

The bug occurs because each time `get_autoconfig_client` is called, it creates a new instance of the HDFS client, leading to a large number of client instances being created when a large number of targets are instantiated. This can lead to resource exhaustion and failure, especially when dealing with a large number of objects.

To fix the bug, the `get_autoconfig_client` function should return the same HDFS client instance each time it is called, instead of creating a new instance. This will ensure that a single client instance is used across all the targets, avoiding resource exhaustion and failure.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_autoconfig_client` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def get_autoconfig_client():
    """
    Creates the client as specified in the `luigi.cfg` configuration.
    """
    if not hasattr(get_autoconfig_client, 'client_instance'):
        configured_client = hdfs_config.get_configured_hdfs_client()
        if configured_client == "webhdfs":
            get_autoconfig_client.client_instance = hdfs_webhdfs_client.WebHdfsClient()
        elif configured_client == "snakebite":
            get_autoconfig_client.client_instance = hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient()
        elif configured_client == "snakebite_with_hadoopcli_fallback":
            get_autoconfig_client.client_instance = luigi.contrib.target.CascadingClient([hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient(),
                                                     hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()])
        elif configured_client == "hadoopcli":
            get_autoconfig_client.client_instance = hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()
        else:
            raise Exception("Unknown hdfs client " + configured_client)
    return get_autoconfig_client.client_instance
```

In the corrected code, a check is added to see if the function already has a `client_instance` attribute. If it does, the function returns that instance. If not, a new instance of the HDFS client is created and saved as the `client_instance` attribute before being returned. This ensures that the same client instance is used across all calls to `get_autoconfig_client`.
