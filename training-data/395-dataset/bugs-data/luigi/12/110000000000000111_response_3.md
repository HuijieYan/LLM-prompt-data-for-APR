Potential Error Location:
The potential error is in the `get_autoconfig_client` function, where the configured_client is checked and different HDFS client objects are returned based on its value.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `get_autoconfig_client` function is not returning the same object each time, which can lead to inconsistency and unexpected behavior when dealing with a large number of HDFS targets.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
One approach to fix this bug is to modify the `get_autoconfig_client` function to return the same HDFS client object each time it is called. This can be achieved by using a singleton pattern to ensure that only one instance of the HDFS client is created and returned.

Corrected Code:
```python
# Corrected and updated function
def get_autoconfig_client():
    """
    Creates the client as specified in the `luigi.cfg` configuration.
    """
    if not hasattr(get_autoconfig_client, "client"):
        configured_client = hdfs_config.get_configured_hdfs_client()
        if configured_client == "webhdfs":
            get_autoconfig_client.client = hdfs_webhdfs_client.WebHdfsClient()
        elif configured_client == "snakebite":
            get_autoconfig_client.client = hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient()
        elif configured_client == "snakebite_with_hadoopcli_fallback":
            get_autoconfig_client.client = luigi.contrib.target.CascadingClient([hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient(),
                                                                 hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()])
        elif configured_client == "hadoopcli":
            get_autoconfig_client.client = hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()
        else:
            raise Exception("Unknown hdfs client " + configured_client)
    return get_autoconfig_client.client
```

This corrected code uses a singleton pattern to ensure that only one instance of the HDFS client is created and returned by the `get_autoconfig_client` function. This will prevent inconsistencies and unexpected behavior when dealing with a large number of HDFS targets.
