The error seems to be related to the `get_autoconfig_client` function, which is responsible for creating the client as specified in the `luigi.cfg` configuration. The function seems to be returning different client objects based on the configuration, which may lead to unexpected behavior, especially when dealing with a large number of targets or clients.

The potential error location within the function is the conditional statements that check the `configured_client` and return different client objects based on its value.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function may return different client objects for the same configuration, potentially causing issues when used in scenarios with a large number of targets or clients.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the function returns the same client object each time it is called, based on the configuration.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_autoconfig_client` function:

```python
# Corrected function
def get_autoconfig_client():
    """
    Creates the client as specified in the `luigi.cfg` configuration.
    """
    if not hasattr(get_autoconfig_client, 'client'):
        configured_client = hdfs_config.get_configured_hdfs_client()
        if configured_client == "webhdfs":
            get_autoconfig_client.client = hdfs_webhdfs_client.WebHdfsClient()
        elif configured_client == "snakebite":
            get_autoconfig_client.client = hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient()
        elif configured_client == "snakebite_with_hadoopcli_fallback":
            get_autoconfig_client.client = luigi.contrib.target.CascadingClient([hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient(),
                                                     hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()])
        elif configured_client == "hadoopcli":
            get_autoconfig_client.client = hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()
        else:
            raise Exception("Unknown hdfs client " + configured_client)

    return get_autoconfig_client.client
```

In the corrected code, the function now stores the client object as an attribute of the function itself, ensuring that the same client object is returned for the same configuration, regardless of how many times the function is called. This should address the issue related to many targets or clients causing failures.
