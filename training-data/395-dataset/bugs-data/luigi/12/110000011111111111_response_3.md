The error occurs because the `get_autoconfig_client()` function is not returning the same client object each time it is called. This is evident from the test function `test_get_autoconfig_client_cached` where it fails the assertion for the client objects not being the same.

The potential error location is within the `get_autoconfig_client()` function where the different client objects are returned based on the `configured_client` value.

The reason for the bug is that the client object is not cached and returned consistently. This leads to the test failure when it tries to compare the original client with the client returned in the subsequent calls.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the client object is cached and returned consistently for each call to `get_autoconfig_client()`.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
# Corrected function
def get_autoconfig_client():
    """
    Creates the client as specified in the `luigi.cfg` configuration.
    """
    if not hasattr(get_autoconfig_client, 'cached_client'):
        configured_client = hdfs_config.get_configured_hdfs_client()
        if configured_client == "webhdfs":
            get_autoconfig_client.cached_client = hdfs_webhdfs_client.WebHdfsClient()
        elif configured_client == "snakebite":
            get_autoconfig_client.cached_client = hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient()
        elif configured_client == "snakebite_with_hadoopcli_fallback":
            get_autoconfig_client.cached_client = luigi.contrib.target.CascadingClient([
                hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient(),
                hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()
            ])
        elif configured_client == "hadoopcli":
            get_autoconfig_client.cached_client = hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()
        else:
            raise Exception("Unknown hdfs client " + configured_client)
    return get_autoconfig_client.cached_client
```

With this correction, the `get_autoconfig_client()` function now caches the client object if it's not already cached, and returns the cached client consistently for each call. This ensures that the original client is the same as the client returned in subsequent calls, fixing the test failure.
