Potential error location: The issue seems to be related to the `get_autoconfig_client` function in the `clients.py` file.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs due to the function returning a new instance of the client every time it is called. This can lead to resource exhaustion when many targets or clients are instantiated, as each call creates a new client instance.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, the function should be modified to return the same client object each time it is called. This can be achieved by caching the client object and returning the cached object on subsequent calls.

Now, here's the corrected code for the `get_autoconfig_client` function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_12/luigi/contrib/hdfs/clients.py

# corrected function
def get_autoconfig_client():
    """
    Creates the client as specified in the `luigi.cfg` configuration.
    """
    if not hasattr(get_autoconfig_client, 'cached_client'):
        configured_client = hdfs_config.get_configured_hdfs_client()
        if configured_client == "webhdfs":
            get_autoconfig_client.cached_client = hdfs_webhdfs_client.WebHdfsClient()
        elif configured_client == "snakebite":
            get_autoconfig_client.cached_client = hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient()
        elif configured_client == "snakebite_with_hadoopcli_fallback":
            get_autoconfig_client.cached_client = luigi.contrib.target.CascadingClient([hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient(),
                                                     hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()])
        elif configured_client == "hadoopcli":
            get_autoconfig_client.cached_client = hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()
        else:
            raise Exception("Unknown hdfs client " + configured_client)
    
    return get_autoconfig_client.cached_client
```

By caching the client object and returning the cached object on subsequent calls, this should prevent resource exhaustion when many targets or clients are instantiated.
