The error seems to be related to the creation of multiple HdfsTargets using the get_autoconfig_client function. The bug occurs when a large number of HdfsTargets are instantiated, causing the program to fail.

The potential error location within the get_autoconfig_client function is likely the instantiation of the client based on the configured_client value.

The bug occurs because the get_autoconfig_client function does not consistently return the same object for the client. This can lead to instability, especially when multiple HdfsTargets are created with different instances of the client, as observed in the test case.

To fix the bug, the get_autoconfig_client function should return the same client object each time it is called. This could be achieved by using a singleton pattern or caching the client object to ensure that it is reused.

Here's the corrected code for the get_autoconfig_client function:

```python
# Corrected function
def get_autoconfig_client():
    """
    Creates and returns the same client object as specified in the `luigi.cfg` configuration.
    """
    if not hasattr(get_autoconfig_client, 'client_instance'):
        configured_client = hdfs_config.get_configured_hdfs_client()
        if configured_client == "webhdfs":
            get_autoconfig_client.client_instance = hdfs_webhdfs_client.WebHdfsClient()
        elif configured_client == "snakebite":
            get_autoconfig_client.client_instance = hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient()
        elif configured_client == "snakebite_with_hadoopcli_fallback":
            get_autoconfig_client.client_instance = luigi.contrib.target.CascadingClient([hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient(),
                                                                                         hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()])
        elif configured_client == "hadoopcli":
            get_autoconfig_client.client_instance = hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()
        else:
            raise Exception("Unknown hdfs client " + configured_client)
    return get_autoconfig_client.client_instance
```

In this corrected code, we use the `hasattr` method to check if the client_instance has been created before. If it hasn't, we create the client instance based on the configured_client and store it as an attribute of the function. Subsequent calls to get_autoconfig_client will return the same client instance, ensuring consistency and stability, as well as reducing resource usage.
