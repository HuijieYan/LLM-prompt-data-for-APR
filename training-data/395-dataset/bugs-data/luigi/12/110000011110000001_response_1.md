The test case `test_get_autoconfig_client_cached` is comparing the original client with the result of the `get_autoconfig_client` function, expecting them to be the same object. However, the assertion fails because the two objects have different memory addresses.

The potential error location within the `get_autoconfig_client` function is the lack of caching for the created client objects. Every time the function is called, a new client instance is created, leading to the inconsistency observed in the test case.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function does not cache the client object. Instead, it creates a new client object each time it is called, leading to the assertion failure in the test case.

To fix the bug, one possible approach is to introduce a caching mechanism for the client objects. We can store the created client object in a variable and return it if it has been previously created.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_autoconfig_client` function:

```python
# Corrected function
cached_client = None

def get_autoconfig_client():
    global cached_client
    if cached_client is not None:
        return cached_client
    
    configured_client = hdfs_config.get_configured_hdfs_client()
    if configured_client == "webhdfs":
        cached_client = hdfs_webhdfs_client.WebHdfsClient()
    elif configured_client == "snakebite":
        cached_client = hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient()
    elif configured_client == "snakebite_with_hadoopcli_fallback":
        cached_client = luigi.contrib.target.CascadingClient([hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient(),
                                                     hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()])
    elif configured_client == "hadoopcli":
        cached_client = hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()
    else:
        raise Exception("Unknown hdfs client " + configured_client)
        
    return cached_client
```

In the corrected code, we introduced a `cached_client` variable that holds the created client object. If it is not `None`, we return the cached client. Otherwise, we create the client object based on the configuration and cache it for subsequent calls. This way, the test case should pass as the same client object is returned for multiple calls to the `get_autoconfig_client` function.
