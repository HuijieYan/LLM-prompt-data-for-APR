The bug is likely to be located in the `get_autoconfig_client` function, where the issue seems to be related to the creation and caching of the HDFS client instance. 

The test case `test_get_autoconfig_client_cached` tries to assert that the original client instance fetched from `get_autoconfig_client` is the same as the client instance fetched in subsequent calls to `get_autoconfig_client`. However, the assertion fails, indicating that the client instances are not the same, even though they should be.

The bug is likely due to the caching mechanism not working as intended, resulting in the creation of new client instances on subsequent calls to `get_autoconfig_client`. This could be due to the use of a cached value that is not being stored correctly or not being used as expected.

To fix the bug, the caching mechanism for the client instance needs to be reviewed and corrected.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_autoconfig_client` function:

```python
def get_autoconfig_client():
    """
    Creates the client as specified in the `luigi.cfg` configuration.
    """
    if hasattr(get_autoconfig_client, "cached_client"):
        return get_autoconfig_client.cached_client

    configured_client = hdfs_config.get_configured_hdfs_client()
    if configured_client == "webhdfs":
        get_autoconfig_client.cached_client = hdfs_webhdfs_client.WebHdfsClient()
    elif configured_client == "snakebite":
        get_autoconfig_client.cached_client = hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient()
    elif configured_client == "snakebite_with_hadoopcli_fallback":
        get_autoconfig_client.cached_client = luigi.contrib.target.CascadingClient([
            hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient(),
            hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()
        ])
    elif configured_client == "hadoopcli":
        get_autoconfig_client.cached_client = hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()
    else:
        raise Exception("Unknown hdfs client " + configured_client)

    return get_autoconfig_client.cached_client
```

In the corrected code, we have added a check to see if the function has a `cached_client` attribute. If it does, we return the cached client instance. If not, we create the client instance based on the configured client, store it in the `cached_client` attribute, and return it. This ensures that the client instance is cached and reused for subsequent calls to `get_autoconfig_client`.
