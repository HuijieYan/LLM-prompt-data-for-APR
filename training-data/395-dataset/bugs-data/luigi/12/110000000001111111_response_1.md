The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of the `configured_client` variable with string values. This comparison might not be accurate, leading to the function returning unexpected clients.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `configured_client` variable might not be correctly assigned with the expected client name, leading to a mismatch in the client returned by the function.

To fix the bug, it is important to ensure that the `configured_client` variable is correctly assigned with the expected client name. One approach to achieve this would be to use a dictionary to map the configured clients to their respective client objects. This approach will ensure that the expected client is returned based on the configured client name provided.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def get_autoconfig_client():
    """
    Creates the client as specified in the `luigi.cfg` configuration.
    """
    configured_client = hdfs_config.get_configured_hdfs_client()
    client_mapping = {
        "webhdfs": hdfs_webhdfs_client.WebHdfsClient(),
        "snakebite": hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient(),
        "snakebite_with_hadoopcli_fallback": luigi.contrib.target.CascadingClient([
            hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient(),
            hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()
        ]),
        "hadoopcli": hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()
    }
    if configured_client in client_mapping:
        return client_mapping[configured_client]
    else:
        raise Exception("Unknown hdfs client " + configured_client)
```
