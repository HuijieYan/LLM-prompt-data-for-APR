The error message indicates that the test function `test_get_autoconfig_client_cached` is failing because the objects returned by `get_autoconfig_client` are not the same, even though they should be.

The potential error lies in the function `get_autoconfig_client`, where it returns a different client instance based on the configured client type each time it is called. This behavior causes the test function to fail because it expects the same client instance to be returned on subsequent calls.

The bug occurs because the function `get_autoconfig_client` creates a new client instance each time it is called, instead of returning the same instance. This behavior contradicts the expectation of the test function and may cause unexpected behavior in other parts of the code as well.

To fix the bug, the `get_autoconfig_client` function should be modified to return the same client instance each time it is called. This can be achieved by storing the created client instances and returning the stored instance on subsequent calls.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_autoconfig_client` function:

```python
# Corrected function
import hdfs_webhdfs_client
import hdfs_snakebite_client
import hdfs_hadoopcli_clients
import luigi.contrib.target

configured_clients = {}

def get_autoconfig_client():
    """
    Creates the client as specified in the `luigi.cfg` configuration.
    """
    configured_client = hdfs_config.get_configured_hdfs_client()
    
    if configured_client in configured_clients:
        return configured_clients[configured_client]

    if configured_client == "webhdfs":
        configured_clients[configured_client] = hdfs_webhdfs_client.WebHdfsClient()
    elif configured_client == "snakebite":
        configured_clients[configured_client] = hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient()
    elif configured_client == "snakebite_with_hadoopcli_fallback":
        configured_clients[configured_client] = luigi.contrib.target.CascadingClient([hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient(),
                                                     hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()])
    elif configured_client == "hadoopcli":
        configured_clients[configured_client] = hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()
    else:
        raise Exception("Unknown hdfs client " + configured_client)
    
    return configured_clients[configured_client]
```

In the corrected code, we use a dictionary `configured_clients` to store the created client instances based on the configured client type. When the function is called, it checks if the client instance for the configured client type is already stored in the dictionary. If it is, it returns the stored instance; otherwise, it creates a new instance, stores it in the dictionary, and returns it. This ensures that the same client instance is returned on subsequent calls.
