The error occurs because the `get_autoconfig_client()` function is not returning the same client every time it is called, even though the test is expecting it to do so. This mismatch in the returned clients causes the assertion error in the test.

The potential error in the function lies in the absence of a mechanism to cache and return the same client instance every time `get_autoconfig_client()` is called. The function always creates a new client instance based on the configured client type, leading to different client instances on every call.

To fix this, you can introduce a caching mechanism to store and return the client instance based on the configured client type. This way, the function will always return the same client instance for the same configured client type.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_autoconfig_client()` function:

```python
# Corrected function
def get_autoconfig_client():
    """
    Creates the client as specified in the `luigi.cfg` configuration.
    """
    if not hasattr(get_autoconfig_client, "cached_client"):
        configured_client = hdfs_config.get_configured_hdfs_client()
        if configured_client == "webhdfs":
            get_autoconfig_client.cached_client = hdfs_webhdfs_client.WebHdfsClient()
        elif configured_client == "snakebite":
            get_autoconfig_client.cached_client = hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient()
        elif configured_client == "snakebite_with_hadoopcli_fallback":
            get_autoconfig_client.cached_client = luigi.contrib.target.CascadingClient([hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient(),
                                                                                hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()])
        elif configured_client == "hadoopcli":
            get_autoconfig_client.cached_client = hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()
        else:
            raise Exception("Unknown hdfs client " + configured_client)
    return get_autoconfig_client.cached_client
```

In the corrected code, we introduce a `cached_client` attribute within the function itself to store the client instance. On subsequent calls to the function, it returns the cached client instance instead of creating a new one, ensuring that the same client instance is returned every time. This should resolve the issue observed in the test case.
