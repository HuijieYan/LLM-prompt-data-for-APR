1. The test case `test_get_autoconfig_client_cached` is trying to ensure that the `get_autoconfig_client` function returns the same client object every time it is called. However, the assertion is failing, indicating that the function is not returning the same client object.

2. The potential error location within the `get_autoconfig_client` function is that it might be creating a new client object every time it is called, instead of returning the same object.

3. The bug occurs because the `get_autoconfig_client` function is not returning the same client object every time it is called. This inconsistency leads to the failure of the assertion in the test case.

4. To fix the bug, we can modify the `get_autoconfig_client` function to return the same client object every time it is called. This can be achieved by implementing a caching mechanism to store and return the client object if it has already been created.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `get_autoconfig_client` function:

```python
# Corrected function
def get_autoconfig_client():
    """
    Creates the client as specified in the `luigi.cfg` configuration.
    """
    if not hasattr(get_autoconfig_client, "cached_client"):
        configured_client = hdfs_config.get_configured_hdfs_client()
        if configured_client == "webhdfs":
            get_autoconfig_client.cached_client = hdfs_webhdfs_client.WebHdfsClient()
        elif configured_client == "snakebite":
            get_autoconfig_client.cached_client = hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient()
        elif configured_client == "snakebite_with_hadoopcli_fallback":
            get_autoconfig_client.cached_client = luigi.contrib.target.CascadingClient([hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient(),
                                                                                     hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()])
        elif configured_client == "hadoopcli":
            get_autoconfig_client.cached_client = hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()
        else:
            raise Exception("Unknown hdfs client " + configured_client)
    
    return get_autoconfig_client.cached_client
```

In the corrected code, we have added a check to see if the function already has a cached client object. If it does, we return the cached client. Otherwise, we create the client based on the configuration and store it in the `cached_client` attribute of the function. This ensures that the same client object is returned every time the function is called, fixing the bug identified in the test case.
