The error message from the test function indicates that the function `get_autoconfig_client` is not returning the same client instance when called multiple times. This inconsistency is causing the assertion error.

The potential error location within the `get_autoconfig_client` function is when a new client instance is returned based on the configured client type. It seems like the function is not handling the caching of the client instances properly.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function does not store and return the same client instance when called multiple times. This is likely due to the usage of the `thread._local` object for caching, which may not work as intended.

To fix the bug, the function should maintain a cache of the client instances and return the cached instance when called multiple times. This can be achieved by using a dictionary to store the client instances based on the configured client type.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_autoconfig_client` function:

```python
# Corrected function for get_autoconfig_client
def get_autoconfig_client():
    """
    Creates the client as specified in the `luigi.cfg` configuration.
    """
    if not hasattr(get_autoconfig_client, 'client_cache'):
        get_autoconfig_client.client_cache = {}

    configured_client = hdfs_config.get_configured_hdfs_client()

    if configured_client not in get_autoconfig_client.client_cache:
        if configured_client == "webhdfs":
            get_autoconfig_client.client_cache[configured_client] = hdfs_webhdfs_client.WebHdfsClient()
        elif configured_client == "snakebite":
            get_autoconfig_client.client_cache[configured_client] = hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient()
        elif configured_client == "snakebite_with_hadoopcli_fallback":
            get_autoconfig_client.client_cache[configured_client] = luigi.contrib.target.CascadingClient([hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient(),
                                                                                                     hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()])
        elif configured_client == "hadoopcli":
            get_autoconfig_client.client_cache[configured_client] = hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()
        else:
            raise Exception("Unknown hdfs client " + configured_client)

    return get_autoconfig_client.client_cache[configured_client]
```

With this corrected code, the function maintains a cache of client instances and returns the cached instance when called multiple times. This should resolve the inconsistency issue observed in the test.
