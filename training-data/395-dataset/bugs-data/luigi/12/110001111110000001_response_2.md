The error message indicates that the test function is failing because it is not returning the same original client object when calling the `get_autoconfig_client` function multiple times in the loop.

The potential error in the problematic function is that it is creating a new client object every time it is called, rather than returning the same cached client object.

This bug is occurring because the function does not cache the client object and creates a new one every time it is called.

To fix this bug, we need to cache the client object and return the cached object when the function is called. This can be achieved by using a class-level attribute to store the client instance and return this instance when the function is called.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_12/luigi/contrib/hdfs/clients.py

# Define a class to contain the client instance
class HdfsClientCache:
    client = None

def get_autoconfig_client():
    """
    Creates the client as specified in the `luigi.cfg` configuration.
    """
    # Check if the client is already cached, if so return the cached client
    if HdfsClientCache.client:
        return HdfsClientCache.client

    configured_client = hdfs_config.get_configured_hdfs_client()
    if configured_client == "webhdfs":
        HdfsClientCache.client = hdfs_webhdfs_client.WebHdfsClient()
    elif configured_client == "snakebite":
        HdfsClientCache.client = hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient()
    elif configured_client == "snakebite_with_hadoopcli_fallback":
        HdfsClientCache.client = luigi.contrib.target.CascadingClient([hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient(),
                                                     hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()])
    elif configured_client == "hadoopcli":
        HdfsClientCache.client = hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()
    else:
        raise Exception("Unknown hdfs client " + configured_client)

    return HdfsClientCache.client
```

By using the class-level `HdfsClientCache` to store the client instance, we ensure that the same client object is returned when the function is called multiple times. This should fix the bug and make the test function pass.
