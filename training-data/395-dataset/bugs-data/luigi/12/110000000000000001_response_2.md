Potential Error:
The potential error in the code is that the function is not properly returning the different types of HDFS clients based on the configured client value.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function is not returning the appropriate HDFS client based on the configured client value. Instead of returning the client objects, it is returning the class names.

Possible Approach to Fix the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to create instances of the HDFS clients and return them based on the configured client value. We also need to handle the case where the configured client value is not recognized.

Corrected Code:
```python
import hdfs_config
import hdfs_webhdfs_client
import hdfs_snakebite_client
import hdfs_hadoopcli_clients
import luigi.contrib.target

def get_autoconfig_client():
    """
    Creates the client as specified in the `luigi.cfg` configuration.
    """
    configured_client = hdfs_config.get_configured_hdfs_client()
    if configured_client == "webhdfs":
        return hdfs_webhdfs_client.WebHdfsClient()
    elif configured_client == "snakebite":
        return hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient()
    elif configured_client == "snakebite_with_hadoopcli_fallback":
        return luigi.contrib.target.CascadingClient([hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient(),
                                                     hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()])
    elif configured_client == "hadoopcli":
        return hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()
    else:
        raise Exception("Unknown hdfs client " + configured_client)
```
