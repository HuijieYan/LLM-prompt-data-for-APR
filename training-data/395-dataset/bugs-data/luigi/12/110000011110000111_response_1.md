The error message from the test function indicates that the `get_autoconfig_client` function is not returning the same object instance every time it is called, which is causing the test to fail.

The potential error location within the `get_autoconfig_client` function is that it is creating a new instance of the client every time it is called, rather than returning the already instantiated client.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not returning the same object instance each time it is called, which is causing inconsistencies in the test case.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `get_autoconfig_client` function to maintain a single instance of the client and return the same instance every time it is called.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_autoconfig_client` function:

```python
# corrected function
def get_autoconfig_client():
    """
    Creates and returns the client as specified in the `luigi.cfg` configuration.
    """
    if not hasattr(get_autoconfig_client, "_client"):
        configured_client = hdfs_config.get_configured_hdfs_client()
        if configured_client == "webhdfs":
            get_autoconfig_client._client = hdfs_webhdfs_client.WebHdfsClient()
        elif configured_client == "snakebite":
            get_autoconfig_client._client = hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient()
        elif configured_client == "snakebite_with_hadoopcli_fallback":
            get_autoconfig_client._client = luigi.contrib.target.CascadingClient([hdfs_snakebite_client.SnakebiteHdfsClient(), hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()])
        elif configured_client == "hadoopcli":
            get_autoconfig_client._client = hdfs_hadoopcli_clients.create_hadoopcli_client()
        else:
            raise Exception("Unknown hdfs client " + configured_client)
    return get_autoconfig_client._client
```

By utilizing a class attribute (`_client`) to store the client instance and checking for its existence before creating a new instance, we can ensure that the same client instance is returned every time the `get_autoconfig_client` function is called, thereby fixing the bug.
