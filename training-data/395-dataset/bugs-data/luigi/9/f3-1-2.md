Hi.

I use the retcode configurations as below in luigi.cfg,

[retcode]
already_running=10
missing_data=20
not_run=25
task_failed=30
scheduling_error=35
unhandled_exception=40
When an one task was once failed and then succeeded in next retry in scheduling during a whole tasks execution, I expected the return code to be zero but actually was non zero.

For example, running examples/foo.py with some code change that Bar(num=7) fails at the first time run but succeeds in the second time run, all the tasks succeeded in the end but the return code is non zero.

===== Luigi Execution Summary =====

Scheduled 12 tasks of which:
* 11 ran successfully:
    - 10 examples.Bar(num=0...9)
    - 1 examples.Foo()
* 1 failed:
    - 1 examples.Bar(num=7)

This progress looks :( because there were failed tasks

===== Luigi Execution Summary =====

The program exited via sys.exit(). Exit status: 30
It seems that the result of Bar(num=7) was doubly counted both in success group and failed group.
```
