The error message indicates that the method `configure_http_handler` was expected to be called once, but it was called 0 times. This discrepancy indicates that the `configure_http_handler` method within the `get` function is not being successfully called.

The potential error likely occurs when trying to call the `configure_http_handler` method. This can happen due to incorrect implementation or misconfiguration of the `metrics` object.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely due to the incorrect implementation of the `configure_http_handler` method within the `get` function. It's possible that the `metrics` object is not being configured correctly, or there may be an issue with the way it is being passed to the `write` method.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the `metrics` object is properly configured before being passed to the `write` method. This may involve checking the implementation of the `configure_http_handler` method and ensuring that it is being called with the correct parameters.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get(self):
    metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
    if metrics:
        metrics.configure_http_handler(self)
        self.write(str(metrics))  # Assuming metrics should be converted to a string before writing
```

In this corrected code, the `metrics` object is explicitly converted to a string before being written. Additionally, the `configure_http_handler` method is called with the correct parameters. This should address the issue described in the error message and the test function.
