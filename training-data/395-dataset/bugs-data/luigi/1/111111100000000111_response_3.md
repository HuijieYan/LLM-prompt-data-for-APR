The potential error in the provided code is that the `metrics.configure_http_handler(self)` is called without defining the `configure_http_handler` method for the `metrics` object. This is likely causing a runtime error.

To fix this bug, we need to define the `configure_http_handler` method for the `metrics` object and then call it in the `get` method of the `MetricsHandler` class.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class MetricsHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the fixed function
    def get(self):
        metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
        if metrics:
            metrics.configure_http_handler()
            self.write(metrics)
    
    # define the configure_http_handler method for the metrics object
    def configure_http_handler(self):
        # implementation of the configure_http_handler method goes here
```

In this corrected code, I added the `configure_http_handler` method to the `MetricsHandler` class. This method will be called on the `metrics` object, allowing it to configure the HTTP handler as needed. This should fix the bug and prevent any runtime errors.
