The error message indicates that the function `configure_http_handler` is expected to be called once, but it is not being called at all. This suggests that there is an issue with how the `configure_http_handler` function is being invoked within the `get` method.

Upon analyzing the code, it appears that the issue is with the `configure_http_handler` function. The usage of `metrics.configure_http_handler(self)` is incorrect, as it is attempting to call `configure_http_handler` on the `metrics` object rather than on the metrics collector object. This is causing the `configure_http_handler` function to not be called at all.

To fix this bug, the `configure_http_handler` function should be called on the metrics collector object instead of the `metrics` object. Additionally, the code should check if the `metrics` are not None before attempting to configure the http handler.

Here's the corrected `get` method:

```python
def get(self):
    metrics_collector = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector
    metrics = metrics_collector.generate_latest()
    if metrics:
        metrics_collector.configure_http_handler(self)
        self.write(metrics)
```

By making these changes, the `configure_http_handler` function will be called on the correct object, and the issue of it not being called at all should be resolved.
