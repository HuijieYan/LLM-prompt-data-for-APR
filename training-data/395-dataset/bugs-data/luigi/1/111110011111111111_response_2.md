The error message indicates that the function `configure_http_handler` of `mock_scheduler._state._metrics_collector` was expected to be called once, but it was not called at all. This suggests that the issue is with the `configure_http_handler` function not being called within the `get` method of the `MetricsHandler` class.

The reason for this bug could be that the `configure_http_handler` function is not being triggered properly within the `get` method. This could be due to missing or incorrect implementation of the function call.

To fix this bug, the `configure_http_handler` function needs to be called with the correct arguments within the `get` method. Based on the expected value and type, the corrected code for the `get` method is as follows:

```python
def get(self):
    metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
    if metrics:
        metrics.configure_http_handler(self)
        self.write(metrics)
```

In this corrected code, the `configure_http_handler` function is called with the expected arguments, which should resolve the issue raised in the test case.
