The error message indicates that the "configure_http_handler" method of "_metrics_collector" was expected to be called once but was actually called 0 times. This suggests that the "configure_http_handler" method is not being called within the "get" function implementation.

The potential error location within the "get" function is the line:
```python
metrics.configure_http_handler(self)
```
This line appears to be trying to call the "configure_http_handler" method on the "metrics" object, but it should actually be called on the "_metrics_collector" object.

The bug occurred because the "configure_http_handler" method is being called on the wrong object. It should be called on the "_metrics_collector" object, but the code is attempting to call it on the "metrics" object.

To fix the bug, the "configure_http_handler" method should be called on the "_metrics_collector" object instead of the "metrics" object.

Here's the corrected code for the "get" function:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class MetricsHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # the corrected function
    def get(self):
        metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
        if metrics:
            self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.configure_http_handler(self)
            self.write(metrics)
```

By making this change, the "configure_http_handler" method will be called on the correct object, resolving the issue identified in the test function.
