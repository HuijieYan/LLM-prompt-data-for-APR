Potential error location:
The issue seems to be in the `get()` method of the `MetricsHandler` class. Specifically, the `configure_http_handler` method is not being called as expected.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `configure_http_handler` method is not being called after generating the latest metrics, which is causing the test to fail. This means that the expected behavior is not being executed properly within the `get()` method.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the `configure_http_handler` method is called after generating the latest metrics.
2. Make sure that the `configure_http_handler` method is configured correctly to handle the HTTP requests.
3. Verify that the arguments passed to `configure_http_handler` are correct and match the expected behavior.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def get(self):
    metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
    if metrics:
        self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.configure_http_handler(self)  # Call configure_http_handler
        self.write(metrics)
```
With this correction, the `configure_http_handler` method is called after generating the latest metrics, ensuring that the expected behavior is executed properly. This should resolve the test failure.
