The error message from the test function indicates that the method `configure_http_handler` of `metrics_collector` is not being called as expected.

The potential error in the problematic function is in the line `metrics.configure_http_handler(self)`. The metrics object is trying to call the `configure_http_handler` method, but it should be calling `metrics_collector.configure_http_handler` instead.

The bug occurred because the `configure_http_handler` method is not being called on the correct object.

To fix the bug, the `configure_http_handler` method should be called on `self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector` instead of `metrics`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def get(self):
    metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
    if metrics:
        self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.configure_http_handler(self)
        self.write(metrics)
```

By calling `configure_http_handler` on the correct object, the `configure_http_handler` method should be called as expected, resolving the issue in the test case.
