The error message indicates that the `configure_http_handler` method of `self.mock_scheduler._state._metrics_collector` was expected to be called once, but it was not called at all. This is likely due to the buggy function not properly setting up the `metrics` object and calling `configure_http_handler` on it.

The buggy function is not configuring the `metrics` object before writing it. It should call `configure_http_handler` on the `metrics` object before writing it with `self.write(metrics)`.

To fix this bug, the `metrics` object needs to be properly configured before writing it. The corrected code for the function is as follows:

```python
class MetricsHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def get(self):
        metrics_collector = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector
        metrics = metrics_collector.generate_latest()
        if metrics:
            metrics_collector.configure_http_handler(self)
            self.write(metrics)
```

With this correction, the `metrics` object will be properly configured before being written, and the test should pass without errors.
