The potential error in the provided buggy function is that the `metrics` object is being used to call the `configure_http_handler` method before it has been assigned a value.

The reason for this bug is that the `generate_latest` method of `self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector` is not being called properly to assign a value to the `metrics` variable.

To fix this bug, the `generate_latest` method should be called to assign a value to the `metrics` variable.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class MetricsHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def get(self):
        metrics_collector = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector
        metrics = metrics_collector.generate_latest()
        if metrics:
            metrics.configure_http_handler(self)
            self.write(metrics)
```

In the corrected code, we first assign the `self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector` object to a local variable `metrics_collector`, then we call the `generate_latest` method of `metrics_collector` to assign a value to the `metrics` variable. Finally, we check if `metrics` has a value and then proceed to use it to call the `configure_http_handler` method.
