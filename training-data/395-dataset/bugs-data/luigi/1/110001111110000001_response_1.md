The error message indicates that the method `configure_http_handler` is expected to be called once, but it was not called at all. This indicates that there is a problem with the `get` method in the `MetricsHandler`, probably in the line `metrics.configure_http_handler(self)`.

The potential error location is within the `get` method where `metrics.configure_http_handler(self)` is called.

The reason for the bug is that the `configure_http_handler` method is not being called on the `metrics` object, which results in the test failure.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `configure_http_handler` method is being called on the `metrics` object before writing it.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get(self):
    metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
    if metrics:
        self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.configure_http_handler(self)
        self.write(metrics)
```

By making the above change, the `configure_http_handler` method will be called on the `metrics` object before writing it, resolving the issue identified in the test case.
