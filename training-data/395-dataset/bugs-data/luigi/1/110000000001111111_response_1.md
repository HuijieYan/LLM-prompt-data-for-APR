The error in the provided function is that it is trying to call the `configure_http_handler` method on the `metrics` object, which is incorrect. The `configure_http_handler` method should be called on the `metrics_collector` object instead.

The reason for the bug is that the `configure_http_handler` method is being called on the wrong object within the function.

To fix the bug, we need to call the `configure_http_handler` method on the `metrics_collector` object instead of the `metrics` object.

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
def get(self):
    metrics_collector = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector
    metrics = metrics_collector.generate_latest()
    if metrics:
        metrics_collector.configure_http_handler(self)
        self.write(metrics)
```

In the corrected code, we first assign the `metrics_collector` object from `self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector` and then call the `generate_latest` method on it. If the `metrics` is not empty, we then call the `configure_http_handler` method on the `metrics_collector` object and write the `metrics` using `self.write(metrics)`.
