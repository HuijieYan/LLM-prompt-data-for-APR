Potential error:

The error is likely occurring because the `generate_latest()` method does not return an object that has a `configure_http_handler` method. This is evident from the fact that `metrics` is assigned the value of `self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()` and then `metrics.configure_http_handler(self)` is called. 

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:

The `generate_latest()` method does not return an object that has a `configure_http_handler` method, leading to an AttributeError when `self.write(metrics)` is called.

Approach for fixing the bug:

We need to create an instance of the object that has the `configure_http_handler` method and then call `generate_latest()` on that instance to generate the metrics. Then we can write the metrics using `self.write()`.

Corrected code:

```python
class MetricsHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def get(self):
        metrics_collector = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector
        metrics = metrics_collector.generate_latest()
        if metrics:
            metrics_collector.configure_http_handler(self)
            self.write(metrics)
```

In the corrected code, we first fetch the `metrics_collector` instance from `self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector`, then we call `generate_latest()` on this instance to generate the metrics. We then use `metrics_collector.configure_http_handler(self)` to configure the http handler and finally use `self.write(metrics)` to write the metrics.
