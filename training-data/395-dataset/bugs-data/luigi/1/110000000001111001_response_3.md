# Potential Error Location
The potential error lies in the line `metrics.configure_http_handler(self)` as it seems that the `metrics` object does not have a `configure_http_handler` method. Additionally, `metrics.write` method might not be correctly handling the `self` object.

# Reasons behind the Bug
1. The `generate_latest()` method is returning a MagicMock object which may not have the necessary methods `configure_http_handler` and `write`.
2. It seems that the MagicMock for `self.write` might not be handling the `metrics` object correctly.

# Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug
1. Ensure that the `generate_latest()` method returns a valid object with the necessary methods.
2. Verify that the MagicMock for `self.write` handles the `metrics` object correctly.

# Corrected Code
```python
def get(self):
    metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
    if metrics:
        metrics.configure_http_handler()
        self.write(metrics)
```
In the corrected code, the `configure_http_handler(self)` has been changed to `configure_http_handler()` assuming the method does not require any parameter and the self object is implicitly accessible within the `metrics` object. If `configure_http_handler()` method requires the `self` object, it should be passed accordingly.
