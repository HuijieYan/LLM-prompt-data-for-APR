The potential error in the provided function is that it tries to call a method configure_http_handler on the metrics object, which is not a part of the metrics object.

The bug occurs because the function is trying to call a method configure_http_handler on the metrics object, but the metrics object does not have this method. This is likely causing the function to fail with an AttributeError.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to call configure_http_handler on the appropriate object, which is likely the _scheduler object.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_1/luigi/server.py

# Corrected function
def get(self):
    metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
    if metrics:
        self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.configure_http_handler(self)
        self.write(metrics)
```

In the corrected function, we are calling the configure_http_handler method on the _metrics_collector object of the _scheduler. This should resolve the issue and fix the bug.
