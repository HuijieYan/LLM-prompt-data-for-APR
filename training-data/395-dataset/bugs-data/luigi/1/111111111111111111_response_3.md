The error message indicates that the `configure_http_handler` method of `_metrics_collector` is expected to be called once, but it is called 0 times. This means that the `configure_http_handler` method is not being called in the `get` function as expected.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the line `metrics.configure_http_handler(self)`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `configure_http_handler` method of `_metrics_collector` is not being called within the `get` function.

To fix this bug, the `configure_http_handler` method of `_metrics_collector` should be called after checking if `metrics` is not None.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class MetricsHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def get(self):
        metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
        if metrics:
            metrics.configure_http_handler(self)
            self.write(metrics)
```

By adding the `if metrics` condition, now the `configure_http_handler` method will only be called if `metrics` is not None, which should resolve the issue.
