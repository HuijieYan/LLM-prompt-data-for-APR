The error message indicates that the function `configure_http_handler` is expected to be called once, but it was not called at all.

Upon examining the buggy function, it appears that the `configure_http_handler` method is not being called after the `generate_latest` method. This is likely causing the `configure_http_handler` method to not be invoked at all, leading to the test failure.

To fix this issue, the `configure_http_handler` method should be called after obtaining the metrics from `generate_latest`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MetricsHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def get(self):
        metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
        if metrics:
            handler = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.configure_http_handler(self)  # calling configure_http_handler
            self.write(metrics)
```

By adding the `configure_http_handler` call after obtaining the metrics, the function should now correctly configure the HTTP handler as expected.
