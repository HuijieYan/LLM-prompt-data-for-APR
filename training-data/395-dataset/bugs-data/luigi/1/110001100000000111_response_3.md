Potential error location:
The error is likely occurring because the metrics.configure_http_handler(self) function is called on the metrics object, but it seems that the configure_http_handler function should be called on the metrics collector object instead.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The incorrect function call is causing the metrics object to be passed to the configure_http_handler function, leading to the error.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
We need to make sure that the configure_http_handler function is called on the metrics collector object, not on the metrics object.

Corrected code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_1/luigi/server.py

# corrected function
def get(self):
    metrics_collector = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector
    latest_metrics = metrics_collector.generate_latest()
    if latest_metrics:
        metrics_collector.configure_http_handler(self)
        self.write(latest_metrics)
```
