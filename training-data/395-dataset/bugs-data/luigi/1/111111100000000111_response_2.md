Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the `configure_http_handler` method of the `metrics` object.

Reason for the bug: The `configure_http_handler` method is not a standard method available for the `metrics` object. It seems that the `generate_latest` method is not returning the appropriate object that has the `configure_http_handler` method.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We need to ensure that the correct object with the `configure_http_handler` method is obtained from the `_metrics_collector`.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_1/luigi/server.py

# class declaration containing the corrected function
class MetricsHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def get(self):
        metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
        if metrics:
            http_handler = metrics.get_http_handler()
            self.write(http_handler.render())
```
