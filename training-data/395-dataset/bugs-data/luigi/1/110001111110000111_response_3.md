1. The test case is trying to test the `get` method of the `MetricsHandler` class. It mocks the `generate_latest` method of `_metrics_collector` and asserts that `write` and `configure_http_handler` methods are called with the expected arguments.

2. The potential error location within the `get` method is the line `metrics.configure_http_handler(self)` which is trying to configure the HTTP handler for metrics, but it seems to be missing an essential callback or configuration for the metrics collector.

3. The error message indicates that the `configure_http_handler` method was expected to be called once but it was called 0 times. This suggests that there might be a problem with how the `MetricsHandler` interacts with the `_metrics_collector` and the configuration of the HTTP handler.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Investigate the changes made in issue #2628 and the introduction of the dependency on prometheus_client to understand the context and the changes that might have affected the `MetricsHandler` and `_metrics_collector`.
   - Ensure that the `generate_latest` method of `_metrics_collector` returns a properly configured `metrics` object that includes the necessary callback or configuration for the HTTP handler.
   - Review the changes made to the `MetricsHandler` and ensure that it is correctly interacting with the `_metrics_collector` to configure the HTTP handler.

5. Corrected code for the `get` method:
```python
def get(self):
    metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
    if metrics:
        # Assuming there is a method for configuring the HTTP handler in the metrics object
        metrics.configure_http_handler(self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.configure_http_handler)
        self.write(metrics)
```
In the corrected code, we assume that the `metrics` object returned by `generate_latest` has a method for configuring the HTTP handler, which is being invoked using `configure_http_handler`. This ensures that the `MetricsHandler` interacts with the `_metrics_collector` properly to configure the HTTP handler.
