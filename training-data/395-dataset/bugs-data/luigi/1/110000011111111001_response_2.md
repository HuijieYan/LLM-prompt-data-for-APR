The potential error location in the code is at the `if metrics:` statement. The problem with the code is that the `configure_http_handler` method is being called on the `metrics` variable, which is incorrect. It should be called on the `_scheduler._state._metrics_collector` object.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `configure_http_handler` method is not being called on the correct object. Instead of calling it on the metrics object, it should be called on the `_scheduler._state._metrics_collector` object.

To fix this bug, the `configure_http_handler` method should be called on the `_scheduler._state._metrics_collector` object, and the `generate_latest` method should be called separately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get(self):
    metrics_collector = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector
    metrics = metrics_collector.generate_latest()
    if metrics:
        metrics_collector.configure_http_handler(self)
        self.write(metrics)
```

With this correction, the `configure_http_handler` method is now called on the `metrics_collector` object instead of the `metrics` object. This should resolve the issue and make the test case pass.
