The error message indicates that the method `configure_http_handler` of the `_metrics_collector` is expected to be called once, but it is called 0 times. This points to the problematic function `get` in the MetricsHandler class.

The potential error in the `get` function is that `configure_http_handler` is called on `metrics` instead of `_metrics_collector` and should not be expected inside that function.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `configure_http_handler` should be called directly on the `self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector` object instead of `metrics`.

To fix the bug, the call to `configure_http_handler` needs to be performed directly on `self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector`. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MetricsHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def get(self):
        metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
        if metrics:
            self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.configure_http_handler(self)
            self.write(metrics)
```

By making this change, the `configure_http_handler` will be correctly called on the `_metrics_collector`, resolving the issue identified in the error message.
