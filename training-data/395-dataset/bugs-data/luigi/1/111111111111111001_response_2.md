The issue seems to be related to the `configure_http_handler` method of the `metrics_collector`. The bug is likely occurring because the `configure_http_handler` method is not being called as expected, leading to an assertion error in the test case. This could be due to incorrect usage of the `metrics_collector` object or a problem with the function logic itself.

To address the bug, it's important to ensure that the `configure_http_handler` method is called correctly within the `get` function. Additionally, the `generate_latest` method should be used to retrieve metrics data and configure the HTTP handler appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `get` function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_1/luigi/server.py

# class declaration containing the buggy function
class MetricsHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def get(self):
        metrics_collector = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector
        metrics = metrics_collector.generate_latest()
        if metrics:
            metrics_collector.configure_http_handler(self)
            self.write(metrics)
```

In this corrected code, we obtain the `metrics_collector` object directly from `self._scheduler._state` and then use it to call the `generate_latest` and `configure_http_handler` methods as required. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the `configure_http_handler` method is called as expected in the test case.
