Please fix the function/method provided below and provide the corrected function/method as the output.


# Buggy function source code
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_1/luigi/server.py

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def get(self):
    metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
    if metrics:
        metrics.configure_http_handler(self)
        self.write(metrics)

```




# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
add callback to metric collector
```

## The associated detailed issue description
```text
So that they can configure http handler. This is to fix #2628.

Description
#2628 introduced dependency of prometheus_client and that breaks server.py. This PR
adds a callback for the metrics collector to further customise http handler.

Motivation and Context
I'm not entirely sure exposing http handler to contrib is a good idea, but this is to avoid pulling
in dependency or hardcoding a header value only for the sake of a certain metrics collector.
