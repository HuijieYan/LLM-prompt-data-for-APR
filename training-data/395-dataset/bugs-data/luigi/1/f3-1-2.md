The issue description is:

```text
So that they can configure http handler. This is to fix #2628.

Description
#2628 introduced dependency of prometheus_client and that breaks server.py. This PR
adds a callback for the metrics collector to further customise http handler.

Motivation and Context
I'm not entirely sure exposing http handler to contrib is a good idea, but this is to avoid pulling
in dependency or hardcoding a header value only for the sake of a certain metrics collector.
