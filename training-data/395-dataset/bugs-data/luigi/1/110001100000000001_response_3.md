# Corrected function

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_1/luigi/server.py

# this is the corrected function
def get_metrics(self):
    metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
    if metrics:
        metrics.configure_http_handler(self)
        self.write(metrics)
```

Explanation:
The buggy function "get" is missing the necessary parameter "self" in the function definition, which is required for referring to the class instance within the method. This is a common mistake when defining instance methods in Python.

The corrected code adds the "self" parameter to the function definition, allowing the method to access and modify the instance attributes and properties as intended.

By adding the "self" parameter, the method becomes a proper instance method, and it can then correctly access and modify the instance state through the "self" parameter.
