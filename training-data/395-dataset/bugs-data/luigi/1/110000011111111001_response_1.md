The test case is trying to assert that `configure_http_handler` is called once with `self.handler` as an argument. The error message indicates that `configure_http_handler` was called 0 times, but it was expected to be called once.

The potential error location in the buggy function is in the line `metrics.configure_http_handler(self)`. This line is attempting to call a method `configure_http_handler` on the object `metrics`, but based on the error message, it seems that this call is not happening.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the method `configure_http_handler` is not being called on the object `metrics`. This could be due to a misunderstanding of the functionality of `metrics`.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that `configure_http_handler` is being called on the correct object and in the correct way.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get(self):
    metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
    if metrics:
        metrics.configure_http_handler(self.handler)  # Ensure the method is called on the correct object
        self.write(metrics)
```

By ensuring that `configure_http_handler` is called on the correct object `metrics` and passing `self.handler` as an argument, we can fix the bug in the `get` method.
