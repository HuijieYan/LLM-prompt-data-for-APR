The error message indicates that the 'configure_http_handler' method of 'self.mock_scheduler._state._metrics_collector' was expected to be called once but was called 0 times.

From the provided information, it seems that the issue lies in the 'get' method of the MetricsHandler class. The 'configure_http_handler' method of the metrics object is not being called after writing the metrics.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the 'configure_http_handler' method is not being invoked on the metrics object after it is written using 'self.write(metrics)'.

To fix this bug, you need to ensure that the 'configure_http_handler' method is called on the metrics object after writing it.

Here's the corrected code for the 'get' method of the MetricsHandler class:

```python
class MetricsHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def get(self):
        metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
        if metrics:
            metrics.configure_http_handler(self)  # ensure configure_http_handler is called
            self.write(metrics)
```

By calling 'metrics.configure_http_handler(self)' after writing the metrics, the 'configure_http_handler' method will be invoked on the metrics object, fixing the bug.
