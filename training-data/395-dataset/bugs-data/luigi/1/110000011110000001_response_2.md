The error message indicates that the method `configure_http_handler` is expected to be called once, but it was called 0 times. This means that the `configure_http_handler` method is not being called within the `get` method, leading to the test failure.

The potential error location within the `get` method is the line `metrics.configure_http_handler(self)`. The error occurs because `configure_http_handler` is being called on the `metrics` object, but it should actually be called directly on the metrics collector object.

The bug occurred because the `configure_http_handler` method should be called on the `MetricsCollector` object, not on the `metrics` object. 

To fix the bug, we need to replace `metrics.configure_http_handler(self)` with `self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.configure_http_handler(self)`.


# Corrected function/method
```python
def get(self):
    metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
    if metrics:
        self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.configure_http_handler(self)
        self.write(metrics)
```
