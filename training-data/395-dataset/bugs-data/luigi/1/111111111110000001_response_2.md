The error message indicates that the function `configure_http_handler` is expected to be called once, but it is not being called at all during the `test_get` test case. This points to a potential issue in the `get` method of the `MetricsHandler` class.

The potential error location is the call to `metrics.configure_http_handler(self)`. This line should be calling the `configure_http_handler` method on the `metrics` object, but it appears that it is trying to call `configure_http_handler` on the `metrics` object itself.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is the incorrect usage of the `configure_http_handler` method on the `metrics` object.

To fix the bug, the `configure_http_handler` method should be called on the `metrics` object and passed the `self` object, which is an instance of `MetricsHandler`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MetricsHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    def get(self):
        metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
        if metrics:
            metrics.configure_http_handler(self)
            self.write(str(metrics))  # Write the metrics as a string
```

In the corrected code, `metrics.configure_http_handler(self)` is fixed to call the method on the `metrics` object instead of the `MetricsHandler` object. Additionally, we are converting the `metrics` object to a string to write it using `self.write(str(metrics))`. This should fix the bug and make the `test_get` test case pass.
