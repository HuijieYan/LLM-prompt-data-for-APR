## Analysis
The error message indicates that the `configure_http_handler` method of `self.mock_scheduler._state._metrics_collector` was expected to be called once, but it was called 0 times. This suggests that the `configure_http_handler` method is not being called within the `get` method of the `MetricsHandler` class, which is causing the test failure.

## Error Location
The potential error is in the `get` method of the `MetricsHandler` class. The `configure_http_handler` method should be called after generating the latest metrics, but it is not being called.

## Reasons behind the Bug
The `configure_http_handler` method is not being called in the `get` method, which is necessary for configuring the http handler to further customize http handler.

## Possible Approaches
To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `configure_http_handler` method is called after generating the latest metrics in the `get` method of the `MetricsHandler` class.

## Corrected Code
```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class MetricsHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # the corrected function
    def get(self):
        metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
        if metrics:
            self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.configure_http_handler(self)
            self.write(metrics)
```
