The error message from the test function indicates that the `configure_http_handler` method was expected to be called once, but it was called 0 times. This suggests that there is an issue with the `get` method in the `MetricsHandler` class where the `configure_http_handler` method is not being called.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `get` method where the `configure_http_handler` method is expected to be called.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely that the `configure_http_handler` method is not being correctly invoked after generating the latest metrics, leading to the failed test.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the `configure_http_handler` method is called after generating the latest metrics. This can be done by correcting the method invocation within the `get` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `get` method:

```python
def get(self):
    metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
    if metrics:
        handler = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector
        metrics.configure_http_handler(handler)
        self.write(metrics)
```

In this corrected code, the `configure_http_handler` method is called with the appropriate arguments after generating the latest metrics. This should address the issue identified in the test function and prevent the error message from occurring.
