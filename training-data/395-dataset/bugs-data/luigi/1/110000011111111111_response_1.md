The potential error location within the buggy function seems to be in the line `metrics.configure_http_handler(self)`. This is because `metrics` is expected to have a method `configure_http_handler` in the provided input and expected variable value and type. However, in the buggy code, `metrics` is being used as if it has a `configure_http_handler` method without actually having one.

The bug is occurring because the `generate_latest` method of the metrics collector is not returning an object that has a `configure_http_handler` method as expected in the test case.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to ensure that the `generate_latest` method of the metrics collector returns an object that has a `configure_http_handler` method. This can be done by updating the implementation of the `generate_latest` method in the metrics collector class.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get(self):
    metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
    if metrics:
        metrics.configure_http_handler(self)
        self.write(metrics)
```

Assuming the `generate_latest` method of the metrics collector now returns an object that has a `configure_http_handler` method as expected in the test case, the corrected code should work as intended.
