The error message, in this case, indicates that the method `configure_http_handler` is expected to be called once, but it was called 0 times. This suggests that there is an issue in the `get` method of the `MetricsHandler` class, where the `configure_http_handler` method is expected to be called after generating the latest metrics.

The potential error location is within the `get` method of the `MetricsHandler` class, specifically in the part where `configure_http_handler` is called.

The reason for the bug is that the `get` method is not calling the `configure_http_handler` method correctly, which is why it's not being called at all.

To fix the bug, the correct approach is to call the `configure_http_handler` method on the `metrics` object rather than on `self`, and then write the `metrics` to the response.

Here's the corrected code for the `get` method:

```python
def get(self):
    metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
    if metrics:
        metrics.configure_http_handler(self)
        self.write(metrics)
```

This should ensure that the `configure_http_handler` method is called on the `metrics` object, and the metrics are then written to the response.
