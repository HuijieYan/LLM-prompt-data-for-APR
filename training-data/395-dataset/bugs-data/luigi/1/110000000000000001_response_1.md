Potential error location: The error may be occurring because the metrics object may not have the method configure_http_handler, and the self object may not have the method write.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The metrics object may not be properly initialized or may not have the necessary methods. Similarly, the self object may not have the method write.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Check if the metrics object is properly initialized and has the necessary methods.
2. Check if the self object has the method write.

Corrected code:

```python
def get(self):
    metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
    if metrics:
        metric_data = metrics.generate_latest()
        self.write(metric_data)
```
