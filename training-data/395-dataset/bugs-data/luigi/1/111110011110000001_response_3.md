This code appears to be using the Tornado framework, given the reference to `tornado.web.RequestHandler`. The error message from the test function indicates that the `configure_http_handler` method of `self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector` is expected to be called once, but it is not being called at all.

The potential error location is in the `get` method of the `MetricsHandler` class. The issue is likely in the following lines:
```python
metrics.configure_http_handler(self)
self.write(metrics)
```

The `configure_http_handler` method of `metrics` needs to be called before writing the metrics. It seems like the `configure_http_handler` method is expected to configure the HTTP handler with the provided `self` object, which in this case is an instance of `MetricsHandler`.

To fix this bug, the `metrics.configure_http_handler(self)` line should be moved above `self.write(metrics)`.

Corrected code:
```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class MetricsHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def get(self):
        metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
        if metrics:
            metrics.configure_http_handler(self)  # move this line here
            self.write(metrics)
```

By moving the `metrics.configure_http_handler(self)` line above `self.write(metrics)`, the HTTP handler will be configured before the metrics are written, addressing the issue found in the test function.
