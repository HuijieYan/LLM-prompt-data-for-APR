Potential error location:
The error is likely occurring because the `metrics` object is not properly configured before being written.

Reasons behind the bug:
The `metrics` object is being used without being properly configured with an HTTP handler before being written.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Configure the HTTP handler for the `metrics` object before writing it.
2. Check if the `metrics` object is valid before attempting to configure and write it.

Corrected code:

```python
# Corrected function
def get(self):
    metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
    if metrics:
        http_handler = metrics.configure_http_handler(self)
        if http_handler:
            self.write(http_handler)
```
