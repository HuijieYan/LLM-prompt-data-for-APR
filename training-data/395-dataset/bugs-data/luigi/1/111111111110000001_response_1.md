The error message indicates that the method `configure_http_handler` is expected to be called once but it was actually called 0 times. This means that the `configure_http_handler` method is not being invoked when `self.handler.get()` is called.

The potential error lies in the `get` method of the `MetricsHandler` class. The `metrics.configure_http_handler(self)` call is attempting to configure the HTTP handler using the `metrics` object, but it seems that this call is not working as expected.

One possible reason for this issue is that the `generate_latest` method of the `_metrics_collector` is not returning the expected `metrics` object, or the `configure_http_handler` method is not being called correctly. Another potential reason could be an incorrect setup of the `generate_latest` method, causing it to not produce the expected `metrics` object.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `generate_latest` method returns a valid `metrics` object, and that the `configure_http_handler` method is called with the correct parameters.

Below is the corrected `get` method:

```python
def get(self):
    metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
    if metrics:
        metrics.configure_http_handler(self)
        self.write(str(metrics))  # Convert metrics to string before writing
```

In the corrected method, we have added a conversion of the `metrics` object to a string using `str(metrics)` before writing it. This ensures that the metrics object can be properly written to the HTTP response. Additionally, we assume that the `generate_latest` method returns a valid `metrics` object and that the `configure_http_handler` method is correctly configured to work with the `metrics` object.
