Potential error location: The error is likely to occur at the line `metrics.configure_http_handler(self)`, as `metrics` is not an object that has a method `configure_http_handler`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `metrics` object is being used incorrectly, and the function `configure_http_handler` does not belong to the `metrics` object.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We need to modify the function to handle the `metrics` object correctly and remove the incorrect method call.

Corrected code:
```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class MetricsHandler(tornado.web.RequestHandler):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def get(self):
        metrics = self._scheduler._state._metrics_collector.generate_latest()
        if metrics:
            self.write(str(metrics))
```
