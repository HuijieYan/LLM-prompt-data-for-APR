The error message indicates that there is a TypeError in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class, specifically at the line `if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():`. The error is caused by `self.last_active` being of type `NoneType`, which cannot be used in mathematical operations.

The potential error location is the `last_active=None` parameter in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. This parameter is set to `None`, which causes the `last_active` attribute to be of type `NoneType` when the `Worker` object is created without providing a value for `last_active`.

To fix this issue, we can set a default value for `last_active` in the `__init__` method, and use that default value when `last_active` is not provided during object creation.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By using the `last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()` expression when initializing the `last_active` attribute, we ensure that it defaults to the current time if a specific value is not provided. This will prevent `self.last_active` from being of type `NoneType` and resolve the TypeError in the `prune` method.
