1. The test case is attempting to create a `luigi.scheduler.Worker` object and then calling the `prune()` method on it. The `prune()` method is comparing `self.last_active` (which is set to `None` by default in the `__init__` method) with `config.worker_disconnect_delay + time.time()`, which leads to a `TypeError` due to the unsupported operand types.

2. The potential error location is in the `prune()` method where the comparison `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time()` is being made.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that when `last_active` is not specified in the `__init__` method, it defaults to `None`. When attempting to perform arithmetic operations with `None` and an integer, it results in a `TypeError`.

4. To fix the bug, we can initialize `last_active` to `time.time()` in the `__init__` method if it is not provided.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # perform the necessary operations
            pass
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute is initialized to `time.time()` if no value is provided when creating the `Worker` object. This ensures that the comparison in the `prune` method won't result in a `TypeError`.
