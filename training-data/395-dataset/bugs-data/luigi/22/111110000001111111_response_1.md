The potential error in the problematic function is that the `time` module has not been imported, causing the `time.time()` call to fail.

The bug occurs because the `time` module is not imported, and thus the call to `time.time()` results in an AttributeError.

To fix the bug, we need to import the `time` module at the beginning of the file.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
