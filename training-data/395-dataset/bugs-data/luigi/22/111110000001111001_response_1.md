The potential error in the given code lies in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. The issue is that the `time` module is not imported, so the usage of `time.time()` will raise an error. Another potential issue is that the `last_active` parameter is assigned the default value of `None`, which may not be what the developer intended.

To fix the bug, we need to import the `time` module and also handle the default value for `last_active` correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

In this corrected code:
- We have imported the `time` module at the top of the file.
- We have updated the assignment for `last_active` to use the default value if it's `None`, otherwise it will use the provided value. This will ensure that `last_active` is scoped to the instantiation of the object and is independent for each worker instance.
