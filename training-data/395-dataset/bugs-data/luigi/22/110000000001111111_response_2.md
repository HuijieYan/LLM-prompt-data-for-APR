The potential error in the provided code is that the `time` module is not imported, so the `time.time()` function is causing an error.

The current code is trying to initialize a class with some default values. However, it is using the `time` module without importing it, which will result in an error. The `time` module is needed to get the current time using `time.time()`.

To fix the bug, the `time` module needs to be imported at the beginning of the file. Then, the `time.time()` function can be used to initialize the `started` attribute of the class.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the code should work as expected. The `time` module is imported and used to initialize the `started` attribute of the `Worker` class.
