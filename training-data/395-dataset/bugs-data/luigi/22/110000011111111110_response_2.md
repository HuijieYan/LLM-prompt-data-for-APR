```python
# corrected function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}

    if self.last_active is None:
        self.last_active = time.time()
```
The issue with the original code is that it does not handle the case when last_active is None, causing an error in the test function. The corrected function includes a conditional statement to handle this case.
