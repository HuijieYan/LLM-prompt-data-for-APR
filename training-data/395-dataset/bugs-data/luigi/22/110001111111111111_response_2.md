The error occurs in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class when it tries to add `self.last_active` with `config.worker_disconnect_delay`. The error message indicates that `self.last_active` is of type `NoneType`.

The potential error location is within the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class, where the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that when `last_active` is not provided as an argument when creating a new Worker object, it defaults to `None`. This causes issues in the `prune` method when trying to perform arithmetic operations on `self.last_active` when it is `None`.

To fix the bug, the `__init__` method should be modified to handle the case where `last_active` is not provided as an argument.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this modification, if `last_active` is not provided when creating a new Worker object, it will default to the current time (seconds since epoch). This ensures that `self.last_active` is never `None`, fixing the error in the `prune` method.
