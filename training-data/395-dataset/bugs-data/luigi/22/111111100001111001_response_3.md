The given error message or description does not specify the exact nature of the bug. However, based on the input and expected variable values, it seems that the bug may be related to the initialization of the 'last_active' and 'started' variables in the __init__ function. The expected value for 'started' is significantly different in comparison to the input, which suggests that there may be an issue with the initialization of the 'started' variable.

Potential error location:
The bug may be in the way the 'started' variable is being initialized.

Reason for the bug:
The bug may be occurring because the 'started' variable is being initialized with a fixed value obtained using time.time(), and the expected values are different. This suggests that the 'started' variable is not getting initialized correctly according to the expected behavior.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
One way to fix the bug is to ensure that the 'started' variable is initialized with the current timestamp when the Worker object is created. This will ensure that the 'started' variable reflects the actual time when the object is instantiated.

Another approach is to refactor the __init__ method to have explicit handling of 'last_active' and 'started' based on the provided values, and then to test its behavior.

Given the assessment of the bug, the corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.started = time.time()  # Initialize 'started' with the current time
        self.last_active = last_active  # Initialize 'last_active' based on the provided value
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
In this corrected code, the 'started' variable is initialized with the current time using time.time(), and the 'last_active' variable is initialized based on the provided value. This approach ensures that the 'started' variable reflects the actual time when the object is instantiated, addressing the potential bug.
