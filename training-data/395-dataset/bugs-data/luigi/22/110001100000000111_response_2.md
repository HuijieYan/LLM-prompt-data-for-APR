The potential error in the provided code is that the `time` module has not been imported, so the `time.time()` method will result in an AttributeError as it is called on an undefined variable `time`.

To fix this, we need to import the `time` module at the beginning of the file.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_22/luigi/scheduler.py

import time  # import the time module

# corrected __init__ function
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
Now the `time` module has been imported, and the function should work as intended without any errors.
