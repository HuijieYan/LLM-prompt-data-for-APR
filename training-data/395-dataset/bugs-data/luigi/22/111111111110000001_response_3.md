The error occurs in the `prune` method called in the test case. The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class. This is caused by the addition of `None` with an integer in the line `if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():`.

The potential error location is in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `last_active` attribute is given a default value of `None` in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class. When this is not updated, it leads to a `TypeError` when trying to add an integer to `None` in the `prune` method.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to check if `last_active` is `None` before performing any addition. If it is `None`, then the worker has never been active and should not be pruned.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """
    # ... omitted code ...

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active is not None and self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # perform prune action here
```
