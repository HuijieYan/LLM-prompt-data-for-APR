The problem with the provided `__init__` method in the `Worker` class is that it is using the `time` module without importing it. This will result in a NameError since the `time` module is not defined.

To fix this issue, the `time` module needs to be imported at the beginning of the file. Additionally, the `last_active` parameter should be initialized to the current time if no value is provided, and the `started` attribute should be set to the current time as well.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
import time  # Import the time module at the beginning of the file

# class declaration containing the fixed function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # this is the fixed function
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With these changes, the `time` module is imported at the beginning of the file, and the `last_active` parameter is initialized to the current time if no value is provided. Additionally, the `started` attribute is set to the current time. This should resolve the issue with the original buggy function.
