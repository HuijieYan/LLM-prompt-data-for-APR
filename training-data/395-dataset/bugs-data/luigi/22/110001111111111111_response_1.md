The error occurs in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class which is being called in the `test_worker_prune_after_init` test. The error message indicates a `TypeError` in the `prune` method, specifically in the line `if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():`

The reason for the error is that `self.last_active` is initialized as `None` in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class, which causes the `TypeError` when trying to perform addition with `config.worker_disconnect_delay`.

To fix the bug, `last_active` should be initialized with a default value of `0` instead of `None` to avoid the `TypeError` when trying to add it with another integer.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class:

```python
class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will default to `0` if not specified, and the addition operation in the `prune` method will work as expected.
