The potential error in the problematic function is that the 'time' module is not imported, so the line `self.started = time.time()` will cause an error.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the 'time' module needs to be imported to use the `time.time()` function.

To fix the bug, the 'time' module needs to be imported at the beginning of the file using `import time`. Then the `time.time()` function can be used to initialize the `self.started` variable.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
