```python
import time

class Worker:
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else 0  # seconds since epoch, default to 0 if last_active is None
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```
The `last_active` parameter is being assigned to `None` in the original code, which causes issues when trying to perform operations on it later. I added a check to set `last_active` to 0 if it is provided as `None`. This should resolve the issue.
