Potential error location: The error is occurring in the prune method of the Worker class, specifically at the line `if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time()`. 

Reason for the bug: The bug is occurring because the `last_active` attribute is being initialized as `None` in the `__init__` method. When trying to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `self.last_active`, it's trying to add an integer to a NoneType, which results in a TypeError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Set a default value for `last_active` in the `__init__` method so that it's set to the current time if not provided.
2. Check if `last_active` is None before trying to perform any operations on it in the prune method.

```python
# Corrected function
import time

class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch if provided
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch if not provided
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
    
    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # implement prune logic here
            pass
```
