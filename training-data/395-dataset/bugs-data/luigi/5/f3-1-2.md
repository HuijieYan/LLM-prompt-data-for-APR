The issue description is:

```text
As discussed in on the mailing list, using @inherits messes up the method resolution order and breaks super()

>>> class Foo(luigi.Task): pass
...
>>> @inherits(Foo)
... class Bar(luigi.Task): pass
...
>>> Bar.__mro__
(<class '__main__.Bar'>, <class '__main__.Bar'>, <class 'luigi.task.Task'>, <type 'object'>)
Since Bar is now twice on the list, any calls to super will result in infinite loops.

This problem comes from @inherits using inheritance to modify the class. We should look into whether the class can be monkey-patched instead of subclassed, so that inheritance works as expected.
