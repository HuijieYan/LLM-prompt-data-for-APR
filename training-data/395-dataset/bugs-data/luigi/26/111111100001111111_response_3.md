Potential error location: 
The if-else condition seems to be causing the issue. The `arglist` variable is initialized differently based on the value of `ssh_config`, but the logic inside the if-else block seems to be incorrect.

Reason behind the bug: 
The issue seems to be related to how the `arglist` variable is being constructed based on the value of `ssh_config` and `job.jar()`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the if-else condition to correctly construct the `arglist` variable based on the presence of `ssh_config` and the existence of `job.jar()`.
2. Ensure that the `arglist` is populated with the correct arguments for both the cases (with and without `ssh_config`).

Corrected code:

```python
def run_job(self, job):
    ssh_config = job.ssh()
    if ssh_config and job.jar() and os.path.exists(job.jar()):
        host = ssh_config.get("host", None)
        key_file = ssh_config.get("key_file", None)
        username = ssh_config.get("username", None)
        
        if not host or not key_file or not username:
            raise HadoopJarJobError("missing some config for HadoopRemoteJarJobRunner")
        
        arglist = ['ssh', '-i', key_file, '-o', 'BatchMode=yes']  # no password prompts etc
        
        if ssh_config.get("no_host_key_check", False):
            arglist += ['-o', 'UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null', '-o', 'StrictHostKeyChecking=no']
        
        arglist.append('{}@{}'.format(username, host))
    else:
        arglist = []
        
        if not job.jar() or not os.path.exists(job.jar()):
            logger.error("Can't find jar: %s, full path %s", job.jar(), os.path.abspath(job.jar()))
            raise HadoopJarJobError("job jar does not exist")
    
    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...
```
In the corrected code, the if-else condition has been modified to correctly initialize the `arglist` variable. Additionally, the existence of `job.jar()` is also checked within the if-else condition to ensure that the correct error handling is in place.
