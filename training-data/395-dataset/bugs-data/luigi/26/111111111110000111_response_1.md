The error message indicates a TypeError: expected str, bytes or os.PathLike object, not NoneType. This means that the variable `job.jar()` is returning a NoneType when it's supposed to return a string or a path object. This is causing the error when attempting to use `os.path.abspath` on the result.

To fix this issue, the `job.jar()` and `os.path.exists(job.jar())` condition need to be handled properly to avoid NoneType errors. Additionally, the error message indicates that the "Can't find jar" log is displayed if the jar does not exist, implying that there should be a check to ensure that the jar file exists before proceeding with the rest of the function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Assuming the `job.jar()` function returns the path to the jar file, and `job.main()` returns the main class file.

def run_job(self, job):
    ssh_config = job.ssh()
    if ssh_config:
        # ... (omitted code for ssh_config handling) ...

    arglist = []
    jar_file = job.jar()
    if jar_file and os.path.exists(jar_file):
        hadoop_arglist = luigi.contrib.hdfs.load_hadoop_cmd() + ['jar', jar_file]
        main_class = job.main()
        if main_class:
            hadoop_arglist.append(main_class)

        jobconfs = job.jobconfs()

        for jc in jobconfs:
            hadoop_arglist += ['-D' + jc]

        (tmp_files, job_args) = fix_paths(job)

        hadoop_arglist += job_args
        arglist.extend(hadoop_arglist)

        luigi.contrib.hadoop.run_and_track_hadoop_job(arglist)

        for a, b in tmp_files:
            a.move(b)
    else:
        if not jar_file:
            logger.error("Job jar is not specified")
        else:
            logger.error("Can't find jar: %s, full path %s", jar_file, os.path.abspath(jar_file))
        raise HadoopJarJobError("job jar does not exist")
```

In this corrected code, we first check if the `jar_file` exists and then proceed with the rest of the logic accordingly. If the jar file does not exist or is not specified, it logs an error and raises an exception.
