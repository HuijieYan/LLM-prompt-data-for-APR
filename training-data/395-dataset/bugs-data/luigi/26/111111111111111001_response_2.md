1. The test case is trying to check for the occurrence of a specific exception (`HadoopJarJobError`) when running the `run` method of the `TestMissingJarJob` task.

2. The potential error location within the `run_job` function is where the code is trying to retrieve the absolute path of the `job.jar()` and then handling the case where `job.jar()` might be `None`.

3. The bug occurred because the code is trying to retrieve the absolute path of `job.jar()`, which is resulting in a `TypeError` when `job.jar()` is `None`. This indicates that the function `job.jar()` is returning `None`, which is not expected.

4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `job.jar()` might be `None` and avoid trying to retrieve the absolute path of `None`.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic `run_job` function:

```python
def run_job(self, job):
    ssh_config = job.ssh()
    if ssh_config:
        host = ssh_config.get("host", None)
        key_file = ssh_config.get("key_file", None)
        username = ssh_config.get("username", None)
        if not all([host, key_file, username, job.jar()]):
            raise HadoopJarJobError("missing some config for HadoopRemoteJarJobRunner")
        arglist = ['ssh', '-i', key_file, '-o', 'BatchMode=yes']  # no password prompts etc
        if ssh_config.get("no_host_key_check", False):
            arglist += ['-o', 'UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null', '-o', 'StrictHostKeyChecking=no']
        arglist.append('{}@{}'.format(username, host)
    else:
        arglist = []
        if not job.jar() or not os.path.exists(job.jar()):
            logger.error("Can't find jar: %s, full path %s", job.jar(), os.path.abspath(job.jar()) if job.jar() else "")
            raise HadoopJarJobError("job jar does not exist")

    # Remaining code as it is...
```

In the corrected code, we use the `all` function to check if all the required parameters for SSH configuration are present and also handle the case where `job.jar()` might be `None`. Additionally, we use a conditional expression to handle the case where `job.jar()` is `None` when trying to log its absolute path.
