1. The test case is trying to test a scenario where the job jar is missing. It mocks the `run_and_track_hadoop_job` function and expects it to throw a `HadoopJarJobError` when the `run` method of the `TestMissingJarJob` task is called.

2. The error seems to be occurring in the `run_job` method of the `HadoopJarJobTask` class.

3. The error is happening because the `job.jar()` function is returning `None`, and the code does not handle this case properly. It tries to call `os.path.abspath()` on `job.jar()` without checking if it is `None`, which leads to a `TypeError`.

4. To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `job.jar()` returns `None` and avoid calling `os.path.abspath()` on it in that case. Additionally, it would be good to check for other possible None values that might arise in this function.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `run_job` method:

```python
def run_job(self, job):
    ssh_config = job.ssh()
    if ssh_config:
        host = ssh_config.get("host", None)
        key_file = ssh_config.get("key_file", None)
        username = ssh_config.get("username", None)
        if not all((host, key_file, username, job.jar())):
            raise HadoopJarJobError("missing some config for HadoopRemoteJarJobRunner")
        arglist = ['ssh', '-i', key_file, '-o', 'BatchMode=yes']  # no password prompts etc
        if ssh_config.get("no_host_key_check", False):
            arglist += ['-o', 'UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null', '-o', 'StrictHostKeyChecking=no']
        arglist.append('{}@{}'.format(username, host)
    else:
        arglist = []
        if not job.jar() or not os.path.exists(job.jar()):
            logger.error("Can't find jar: %s", job.jar())
            raise HadoopJarJobError("job jar does not exist")

    # TODO(jcrobak): libjars, files, etc. Can refactor out of hadoop.HadoopJobRunner
    hadoop_arglist = luigi.contrib.hdfs.load_hadoop_cmd() + ['jar', job.jar()]
    if job.main():
        hadoop_arglist.append(job.main())

    jobconfs = job.jobconfs()

    for jc in jobconfs:
        hadoop_arglist += ['-D' + jc]

    (tmp_files, job_args) = fix_paths(job)

    hadoop_arglist += job_args
    arglist.extend(hadoop_arglist)

    luigi.contrib.hadoop.run_and_track_hadoop_job(arglist)

    for a, b in tmp_files:
        a.move(b)
```

In this corrected code, I've added checks for `None` values before performing operations that would throw `TypeError` if called on `None`. I've also removed the unnecessary call to `os.path.abspath()` which was causing the error.
