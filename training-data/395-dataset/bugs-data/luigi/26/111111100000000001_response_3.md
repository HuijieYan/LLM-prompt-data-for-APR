Potential error location: 
The error in the code is likely to occur when the `ssh_config` is not provided, but the `arglist` is being used without being initialized properly.

Reason behind the bug:
The bug occurs because the `arglist` variable is used before it is initialized. If `ssh_config` is not provided, `arglist` is supposed to be an empty list, but it is not being initialized as such.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Initialize the `arglist` variable as an empty list at the beginning of the function.
2. Use an if-else condition to handle the creation of `arglist` based on the presence or absence of `ssh_config`.

Corrected code:
```python
    def run_job(self, job):
        arglist = []  # Initialize arglist as an empty list
        ssh_config = job.ssh()
        if ssh_config:
            host = ssh_config.get("host", None)
            key_file = ssh_config.get("key_file", None)
            username = ssh_config.get("username", None)
            if not host or not key_file or not username or not job.jar():
                raise HadoopJarJobError("missing some config for HadoopRemoteJarJobRunner")
            arglist = ['ssh', '-i', key_file,
                       '-o', 'BatchMode=yes']  # no password prompts etc
            if ssh_config.get("no_host_key_check", False):
                arglist += ['-o', 'UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null',
                            '-o', 'StrictHostKeyChecking=no']
            arglist.append('{}@{}'.format(username, host))
        else:
            if not job.jar() or not os.path.exists(job.jar()):
                logger.error("Can't find jar: %s, full path %s", job.jar(), os.path.abspath(job.jar()))
                raise HadoopJarJobError("job jar does not exist")

        # Rest of the code remains unchanged
