The potential error in the `run_job` function is that the `arglist` variable is being used outside of its scope, which will cause an error when trying to access it.

The error occurs because the `arglist` variable is defined inside an if-else statement, and then used outside of that scope. This means that if the `ssh_config` is not defined, the `arglist` will not be defined either, and using it later in the code will result in an error.

To fix this bug, we can define the `arglist` variable outside of the if-else statement and then append the values based on the conditions.

Here's the corrected code for the `run_job` function:

```python
def run_job(self, job):
    arglist = []  # Define arglist here

    ssh_config = job.ssh()
    if ssh_config:
        host = ssh_config.get("host", None)
        key_file = ssh_config.get("key_file", None)
        username = ssh_config.get("username", None)
        if not host or not key_file or not username or not job.jar():
            raise HadoopJarJobError("missing some config for HadoopRemoteJarJobRunner")
        arglist += ['ssh', '-i', key_file, '-o', 'BatchMode=yes']  # no password prompts etc
        if ssh_config.get("no_host_key_check", False):
            arglist += ['-o', 'UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null', '-o', 'StrictHostKeyChecking=no']
        arglist.append('{}@{}'.format(username, host))
    else:
        if not job.jar() or not os.path.exists(job.jar()):
            logger.error("Can't find jar: %s, full path %s", job.jar(), os.path.abspath(job.jar()))
            raise HadoopJarJobError("job jar does not exist")

    # Rest of the code remains the same
    # ...
```
By defining the `arglist` variable outside of the if-else statement, we can then append values to it based on the conditions, and avoid the error of using an undefined variable outside of its scope.
