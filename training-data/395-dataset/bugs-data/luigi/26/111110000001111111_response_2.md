Potential error location: 
The bug could be in the handling of the ssh_config. It seems that the code is trying to construct a list called `arglist` based on the presence of an ssh_config, but there are issues with the logic and flow of the code.

Reasons behind the bug:
1. If there is an ssh_config, the code tries to construct the `arglist` based on the ssh_config parameters. However, if there is no ssh_config, it does not initialize the `arglist`.
2. Additionally, it seems that there is a missing `else` block that should initialize `arglist` if there is no ssh_config.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Initialize `arglist` at the beginning of the function to avoid any issues with undefined variables.
2. Use an `if-else` block to properly handle the cases when there is or isn't an ssh_config.

Corrected code:
