Potential error location: The error occurs at the line where the `abspath` function is called to get the full path of the job's jar. It seems that the `job.jar()` method is returning a `NoneType` object, which is causing the `os.fspath` to fail with a TypeError.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the `job.jar()` method returns None, indicating that the job's jar file is not being set correctly or is missing.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the implementation of the `job.jar()` method to ensure it returns the correct jar file path. If the jar file path is not being set, it needs to be set correctly.
2. It might be necessary to handle cases where the jar file is not set, and if so, handle it gracefully without causing an error.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def run_job(self, job):
    ssh_config = job.ssh()
    if ssh_config:
        host = ssh_config.get("host", None)
        key_file = ssh_config.get("key_file", None)
        username = ssh_config.get("username", None)
        if not host or not key_file or not username or not job.jar():
            raise HadoopJarJobError("missing some config for HadoopRemoteJarJobRunner")
        arglist = ['ssh', '-i', key_file,
                   '-o', 'BatchMode=yes']  # no password prompts etc
        if ssh_config.get("no_host_key_check", False):
            arglist += ['-o', 'UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null',
                        '-o', 'StrictHostKeyChecking=no']
        arglist.append('{}@{}'.format(username, host)
    else:
        arglist = []
        jar_file = job.jar()
        if not jar_file or not os.path.exists(jar_file):
            if not jar_file:
                logger.error("Jar file is not set for the job")
            else:
                logger.error("Can't find jar: %s, full path %s", jar_file, os.path.abspath(jar_file))
            raise HadoopJarJobError("job jar does not exist")

    # ... rest of the code remains unchanged ...
