The error message suggests that the "os.path.abspath" method in the "run_job" function is receiving a NoneType object, which it does not accept. This means that the "job.jar()" method is returning None, and this is causing the error.

The reason behind this bug could be that the "job" object does not have a valid Jar file path associated with it. This could be due to an incorrect setup or configuration when creating the "job" object.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the "jar()" method returns a valid path before using it in the "run_job" function. If the returned path is None or the file doesn't exist, we should handle this situation gracefully without causing an error.

Here's the corrected code for the "run_job" function:

```python
def run_job(self, job):
        ssh_config = job.ssh()
        if ssh_config:
            host = ssh_config.get("host", None)
            key_file = ssh_config.get("key_file", None)
            username = ssh_config.get("username", None)
            if not (host and key_file and username and job.jar() and os.path.exists(job.jar())):
                raise HadoopJarJobError("missing some config for HadoopRemoteJarJobRunner")
            arglist = ['ssh', '-i', key_file,
                       '-o', 'BatchMode=yes']  # no password prompts etc
            if ssh_config.get("no_host_key_check", False):
                arglist += ['-o', 'UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null',
                            '-o', 'StrictHostKeyChecking=no']
            arglist.append('{}@{}'.format(username, host)
        else:
            arglist = []
            if not (job.jar() and os.path.exists(job.jar())):
                logger.error("Can't find jar: %s, full path %s", job.jar(), os.path.abspath(job.jar()))
                raise HadoopJarJobError("job jar does not exist")
    
        # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

In the corrected code:
- We first check if all the required parameters (host, key_file, username, and jar file) are present before proceeding.
- We also check if the jar file exists before using it, and handle the situation appropriately if it doesn't exist.
- The rest of the function remains unchanged.
