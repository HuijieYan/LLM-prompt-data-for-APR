The error message suggests that there is an issue with the `job.jar()` method returning a `NoneType` instead of a valid string. This is causing a `TypeError` when trying to convert a `NoneType` to a string using `os.path.abspath()`.

The potential error location is within the `run_job()` method where the `job.jar()` method is being called.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely related to the `job.jar()` method not returning a valid value. This could be due to the job configuration not being set correctly or some other issue within the program logic.

To fix the bug, the program should first ensure that the `job.jar()` method returns a valid string. This could involve checking if the jar file exists and setting the jar file path in the job configuration correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def run_job(self, job):
    ssh_config = job.ssh()
    if ssh_config:
        host = ssh_config.get("host", None)
        key_file = ssh_config.get("key_file", None)
        username = ssh_config.get("username", None)
        jar_file = job.jar()  # Get the jar file path
        if not host or not key_file or not username or not jar_file:
            raise HadoopJarJobError("missing some config for HadoopRemoteJarJobRunner")
        arglist = ['ssh', '-i', key_file,
                   '-o', 'BatchMode=yes']  # no password prompts etc
        if ssh_config.get("no_host_key_check", False):
            arglist += ['-o', 'UserKnownHostsFile=/dev/null',
                        '-o', 'StrictHostKeyChecking=no']
        arglist.append('{}@{}'.format(username, host)
    else:
        arglist = []
        if not jar_file or not os.path.exists(jar_file):
            logger.error("Can't find jar: %s, full path %s", jar_file, os.path.abspath(jar_file))
            raise HadoopJarJobError("job jar does not exist")

    # Continue with the rest of the code as it is
    # ...
```

In the corrected code, the `job.jar()` method is called once and its result is stored in the `jar_file` variable. This ensures that the jar file path is obtained only once and is used consistently throughout the function. This should resolve the issue with the `NoneType` error.
