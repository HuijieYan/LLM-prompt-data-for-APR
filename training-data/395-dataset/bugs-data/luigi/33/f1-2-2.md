# buggy class docstring

```text
This is the base class of all Luigi Tasks, the base unit of work in Luigi.

A Luigi Task describes a unit or work.

The key methods of a Task, which must be implemented in a subclass are:

* :py:meth:`run` - the computation done by this task.
* :py:meth:`requires` - the list of Tasks that this Task depends on.
* :py:meth:`output` - the output :py:class:`Target` that this Task creates.

Parameters to the Task should be declared as members of the class, e.g.::

.. code-block:: python

    class MyTask(luigi.Task):
        count = luigi.IntParameter()

Each Task exposes a constructor accepting all :py:class:`Parameter` (and
values) as kwargs. e.g. ``MyTask(count=10)`` would instantiate `MyTask`.

In addition to any declared properties and methods, there are a few
non-declared properties, which are created by the :py:class:`Register`
metaclass:

``Task.task_namespace``
  optional string which is prepended to the task name for the sake of
  scheduling. If it isn't overridden in a Task, whatever was last declared
  using `luigi.namespace` will be used.

``Task._parameters``
  list of ``(parameter_name, parameter)`` tuples for this task class
```
