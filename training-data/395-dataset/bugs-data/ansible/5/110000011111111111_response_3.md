The error message from the test function shows that the order of the missing required arguments in the error message is not as expected. This suggests that the issue lies in the 'check_required_arguments' function.

The bug occurred because the 'missing' list in the 'check_required_arguments' function is being populated as the loop progresses. This means that the order of the missing required arguments in the error message is based on the order in which they are found in the 'arguments_spec' dictionary. This causes the order to deviate from the expected order.

To fix this bug, we can use an OrderedDict instead of a regular dictionary when iterating over the 'argument_spec' items. This will preserve the order of the missing required arguments and ensure that they are presented in the error message in the same order as they are defined in the 'argument_spec' dictionary.

Here's the corrected 'check_required_arguments' function:

```python
from collections import OrderedDict

def check_required_arguments(argument_spec, module_parameters):
    """Check all paramaters in argument_spec and return a list of parameters
    that are required but not present in module_parameters

    Raises TypeError if the check fails

    :arg argument_spec: Argument spec dicitionary containing all parameters
        and their specification
    :arg module_parameters: Dictionary of module parameters

    :returns: Empty list or raises TypeError if the check fails.
    """

    missing = []
    if argument_spec is None:
        return missing

    ordered_spec = OrderedDict(sorted(argument_spec.items()))  # Preserve order of argument_spec items

    for (k, v) in ordered_spec.items():
        required = v.get('required', False)
        if required and k not in module_parameters:
            missing.append(k)

    if missing:
        msg = "missing required arguments: %s" % ", ".join(missing)
        raise TypeError(msg)

    return missing
```

With this correction, the 'missing' list will maintain the order of the required arguments as they are found in the 'argument_spec' dictionary, and the error message will display the missing required arguments in the correct order.
