The test case "test_check_required_arguments_missing_multiple" is checking the functionality of the "check_required_arguments" function with an input dictionary "arguments_terms_multiple" containing three keys: 'bar', 'foo', and 'tomato'. The 'bar' and 'foo' keys are marked as required in the dictionary. The test then checks if the TypeError is raised with the correct error message if the required parameters are missing in the "module_parameters" dictionary.

The error message indicates that the order of the missing parameters is not matching the expected order. 

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the loop that iterates over the "argument_spec" and checks for missing parameters. As the missing parameters are directly appended to the "missing" list, the order in which they were added will not necessarily match the order in the "argument_spec" dictionary.

The bug is occurring because the order of the missing parameters is not preserved when adding them to the "missing" list. When the error message is constructed using ", ".join(missing), it does not necessarily match the order in the "argument_spec" dictionary, leading to the assertion error in the test case.

To fix the bug, the "missing" list should not just include the missing parameters but also their corresponding order. This can be achieved by appending tuples (parameter, order) to the "missing" list. Then during the construction of the error message, the order can be used to ensure the correct order of missing parameters is maintained.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def check_required_arguments(argument_spec, module_parameters):
    missing = []
    if argument_spec is None:
        return missing

    for (k, v) in argument_spec.items():
        required = v.get('required', False)
        if required and k not in module_parameters:
            missing.append((k, v['__ansible_order']))

    if missing:
        missing.sort(key=lambda x: x[1])  # Sort based on the order
        parameters = [x[0] for x in missing]
        msg = "missing required arguments: %s" % ", ".join(parameters)
        raise TypeError(to_native(msg))

    return missing
```

With this corrected code, the missing parameters are appended as tuples containing the parameter name and its order. Then, before constructing the error message, the list is sorted based on the order, ensuring that the error message matches the expected order.
