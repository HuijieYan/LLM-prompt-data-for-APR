1. The error message indicates that the test case is failing because the expected and actual outputs are in reversed order.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the loop that checks for missing required arguments.

3. The bug occurred because the `missing` list is populated in the order in which the missing arguments are encountered, and then the list is returned as is. There is no sorting or ordering of the items in the `missing` list before it is used to raise an error.

4. To fix the bug, we can sort the `missing` list before using it to raise an error. This will ensure that the missing arguments are consistently presented in a specific order.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def check_required_arguments(argument_spec, module_parameters):
    """Check all parameters in argument_spec and return the required but missing parameters.

    Raises TypeError if the check fails.

    :Argument
        argument_spec: Argument spec dictionary containing all parameters and their specifications.
        module_paramaters: Dictionary of module parameters.

    :Returns
        Empty list or raises TypeError if the check fails.
    """

    missing = []
    if argument_spec is None:
        return missing

    for (k, v) in argument_spec.items():
        required = v.get('required', False)
        if required and k not in module_parameters:
            missing.append(k)

    if missing:
        missing.sort()  # Sort the missing arguments
        msg = "missing required arguments: %s" % ", ".join(missing)
        raise TypeError(msg)

    return missing
```
