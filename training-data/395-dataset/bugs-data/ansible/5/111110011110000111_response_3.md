The error message indicates that the assertion in the test function failed because the order of the missing required arguments in the error message did not match the expected order.

Looking at the `check_required_arguments` function, the issue seems to be related to the order in which the missing parameters are appended to the `missing` list. The function is currently appending the missing parameters in the order in which they are encountered during iteration, which causes them to appear in a different order than expected.

This bug occurred because the function does not maintain the order of the missing parameters, and it simply appends them as they are encountered during iteration. This causes the parameters to be listed in a different order than expected, leading to a failed test assertion.

To fix this bug, the function should maintain the order of the missing parameters as they are encountered. One way to achieve this is by using an OrderedDict instead of a regular dictionary for storing the missing parameters.

Here's the corrected code for the `check_required_arguments` function:

```python
from collections import OrderedDict

def check_required_arguments(argument_spec, module_parameters):
    """Check all paramaters in argument_spec and return a list of parameters
    that are required but not present in module_parameters

    Raises TypeError if the check fails

    :arg argument_spec: Argument spec dicitionary containing all parameters
        and their specification
    :arg module_paramaters: Dictionary of module parameters

    :returns: Empty list or raises TypeError if the check fails.
    """

    missing = OrderedDict()
    if argument_spec is None:
        return list(missing.keys())

    for (k, v) in argument_spec.items():
        required = v.get('required', False)
        if required and k not in module_parameters:
            missing[k] = None

    if missing:
        msg = "missing required arguments: %s" % ", ".join(missing.keys())
        raise TypeError(msg)

    return list(missing.keys())
```

With the updated code, the function now uses an OrderedDict to store the missing parameters, preserving their order as they are encountered. This will ensure that the missing parameters are listed in the expected order and will pass the test assertion.
