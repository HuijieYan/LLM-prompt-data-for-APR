Potential error location: The error seems to be occurring in the order of the missing required arguments in the error message being different from the expected order.

Reason for the bug: The bug seems to be related to the order in which the missing required arguments are added to the `missing` list. It seems that the order in which the missing required arguments are appended to the `missing` list is not consistent, which causes the error in the test case.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, we can sort the `missing` list before creating the error message to ensure that the missing required arguments are always presented in the same order, regardless of how they were added to the list.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def check_required_arguments(argument_spec, module_parameters):
    """Check all parameters in argument_spec and return a list of parameters
    that are required but not present in module_parameters

    Raises TypeError if the check fails

    :arg argument_spec: Argument spec dictionary containing all parameters
        and their specification
    :arg module_paramaters: Dictionary of module parameters

    :returns: Empty list or raises TypeError if the check fails.
    """

    missing = []
    if argument_spec is None:
        return missing

    for (k, v) in argument_spec.items():
        required = v.get('required', False)
        if required and k not in module_parameters:
            missing.append(k)

    if missing:
        missing.sort()  # Sort the missing required arguments
        msg = "missing required arguments: %s" % ", ".join(missing)
        raise TypeError(msg)

    return missing
```
