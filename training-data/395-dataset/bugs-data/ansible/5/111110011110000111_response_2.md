The error in the test case is due to the assertion expecting a specific order of missing required arguments. However, the actual error message returned by the function has the arguments in a different order. This indicates that the bug is likely in the order in which the missing arguments are being appended to the 'missing' list in the 'check_required_arguments' function.

The reason behind the bug is that the missing required arguments are being appended to the 'missing' list in the order they are encountered in the 'argument_spec' dictionary. This leads to the error message having a different order of missing arguments than the expected order.

To fix this bug, we can append the missing required arguments to the 'missing' list in the order they are encountered in the 'module_parameters' dictionary, ensuring that the order of missing arguments matches the expected order in the error message.

Here's the corrected code for the 'check_required_arguments' function:

```python
def check_required_arguments(argument_spec, module_parameters):
    """Check all parameters in argument_spec and return a list of parameters
    that are required but not present in module_parameters

    Raises TypeError if the check fails

    :arg argument_spec: Argument spec dicitionary containing all parameters
        and their specification
    :arg module_paramaters: Dictionary of module parameters

    :returns: Empty list or raises TypeError if the check fails.
    """

    missing = []
    if argument_spec is None:
        return missing

    for (k, v) in argument_spec.items():
        required = v.get('required', False)
        if required and k not in module_parameters:
            missing.append(k)

    if missing:
        # Sort the missing arguments based on the order of their appearance in the module_parameters
        missing.sort(key=lambda x: list(module_parameters.keys()).index(x))
        msg = f"missing required arguments: {', '.join(missing)}"
        raise TypeError(msg)

    return missing
```

With this correction, the 'missing' list is sorted based on the order of appearance of the missing arguments in the 'module_parameters' dictionary. This ensures that the error message will have the missing arguments in the expected order, and the test case should pass without any assertion errors.
