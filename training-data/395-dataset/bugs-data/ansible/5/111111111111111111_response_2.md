The error message from the test function indicates that there is an issue with the order of the missing required arguments. The test is expecting "bar, foo" but the function returns "foo, bar".

The potential error location within the problematic function is the generation of the missing required arguments list. It seems that the list is not ordered correctly before being joined into a string in the error message.

The bug occurs because the missing list is not ordered before being joined into a string in the error message. This results in the wrong sequence of missing arguments being included in the error message.

One approach to fixing the bug is to sort the missing list before joining it into a string in the error message. This will ensure that the missing arguments are consistently ordered in the error message.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def check_required_arguments(argument_spec, module_parameters):
    """Check all paramaters in argument_spec and return a list of parameters
    that are required but not present in module_parameters

    Raises TypeError if the check fails

    :arg argument_spec: Argument spec dicitionary containing all parameters
        and their specification
    :arg module_paramaters: Dictionary of module parameters

    :returns: Empty list or raises TypeError if the check fails.
    """

    missing = []
    if argument_spec is None:
        return missing

    for (k, v) in argument_spec.items():
        required = v.get('required', False)
        if required and k not in module_parameters:
            missing.append(k)

    if missing:
        missing.sort()  # Sort the missing list
        msg = "missing required arguments: %s" % ", ".join(missing)
        raise TypeError(to_native(msg))

    return missing
```
