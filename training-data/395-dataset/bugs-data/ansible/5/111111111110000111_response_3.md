The error message from the test function indicates that the order of the missing required arguments is not as expected. The test is expecting "missing required arguments: bar, foo" but the function is returning "missing required arguments: foo, bar".

The potential error location is identified in the `check_required_arguments` function, specifically in the part where the missing required arguments are being appended to the `missing` list. The order of the appending may be causing the unexpected order of the missing arguments.

The bug occurred because the function was appending the missing arguments in the order they were checked, which may not always match the expected order. As a result, the error message in the test case did not match the actual output of the function.

To fix the bug, the `missing` list should be sorted before generating the error message. This will ensure that the error message always displays the missing required arguments in a consistent order.

Here's the corrected code for the `check_required_arguments` function:

```python
def check_required_arguments(argument_spec, module_parameters):
    """Check all parameters in argument_spec and return a list of parameters
    that are required but not present in module_parameters

    Raises TypeError if the check fails

    :arg argument_spec: Argument spec dicitionary containing all parameters
        and their specification
    :arg module_paramaters: Dictionary of module parameters

    :returns: Empty list or raises TypeError if the check fails.
    """

    missing = []
    if argument_spec is None:
        return missing

    for (k, v) in argument_spec.items():
        required = v.get('required', False)
        if required and k not in module_parameters:
            missing.append(k)

    if missing:
        missing.sort()  # Sort the missing arguments
        msg = "missing required arguments: %s" % ", ".join(missing)
        raise TypeError(to_native(msg))

    return missing
```

With this correction, the `missing` list is sorted before generating the error message, ensuring that the error message always displays the missing required arguments in a consistent order.
