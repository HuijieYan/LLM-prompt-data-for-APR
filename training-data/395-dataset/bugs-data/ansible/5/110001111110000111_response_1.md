The error in the code is related to the order of the missing parameters in the error message. The test is expecting "missing required arguments: bar, foo" but the error message is "missing required arguments: foo, bar". This indicates that the order of parameters in the error message is not matching the expected order.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `missing.append(k)` line. This is where the missing parameters are being added to the list. The order in which the parameters are added to the `missing` list is not preserved and this is causing the mismatch in the error message.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `missing` list is not maintaining the order in which the missing parameters are encountered.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to use OrderedDict for the `missing` list. This will preserve the order in which the missing parameters are added. Another approach is to sort the `missing` list before creating the error message to ensure consistent order.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from collections import OrderedDict

def check_required_arguments(argument_spec, module_parameters):
    """Check all paramaters in argument_spec and return a list of parameters
    that are required but not present in module_parameters

    Raises TypeError if the check fails

    :arg argument_spec: Argument spec dicitionary containing all parameters
        and their specification
    :arg module_paramaters: Dictionary of module parameters

    :returns: Empty list or raises TypeError if the check fails.
    """

    missing = OrderedDict()
    if argument_spec is None:
        return list(missing)

    for (k, v) in argument_spec.items():
        required = v.get('required', False)
        if required and k not in module_parameters:
            missing[k] = True

    if missing:
        msg = "missing required arguments: %s" % ", ".join(list(missing.keys()))
        raise TypeError(to_native(msg))

    return list(missing)
```

With the updated code, the order of missing parameters will be preserved when creating the error message, ensuring that the error message matches the expected order in the test case.
