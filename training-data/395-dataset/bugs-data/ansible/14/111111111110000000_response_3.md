The corrected function `fetch_role_related` includes corrections in the `url` variable:
- `_urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions(), "v1", "roles", role_id, related, "?page_size=50")` has the correct format for joining the URL components, `"v1"` parameter is added.
- `url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])` has also been updated with an accurate method for joining the URL components.

The corrected function ensures that the URL is properly formed before being used to make requests.
