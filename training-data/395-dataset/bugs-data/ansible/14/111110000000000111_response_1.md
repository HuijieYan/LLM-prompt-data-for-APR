The error seems to be related to the `fetch_role_related` function in the `GalaxyAPI` class, which is responsible for fetching the list of related items for a given role from Ansible Galaxy server. The users are reporting that an older version of the role is being installed instead of the latest version.

The potential error location within the `fetch_role_related` function is that it does not explicitly specify the version while fetching the role data from the Ansible Galaxy server. This could lead to the API fetching an older version of the role instead of the latest version.

To fix this issue, the `fetch_role_related` function needs to be modified to explicitly specify the version when fetching the role data. This way, it ensures that the latest version of the role is always fetched.

Here's the corrected code for the `fetch_role_related` function:

```python
# this is the fixed function
class GalaxyAPI():
    # ... omitted code ...

    def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id, version="latest"):
        """
        Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
        The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
        """
    
        results = []
        try:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions()[version], "roles", role_id, related,
                           "?page_size=50")
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results = data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
            while not done:
                url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
                data = self._call_galaxy(url)
                results += data['results']
                done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        except Exception as e:
            display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                         % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
        return results
```

In the corrected function, the `fetch_role_related` method now accepts an additional argument `version="latest"`, which defaults to "latest" if not specified. It uses this version argument when fetching the role data from the Ansible Galaxy server to ensure that the latest version is always fetched.
