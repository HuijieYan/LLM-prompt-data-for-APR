The potential error location within the problematic function is at the following line: 
```
url = _urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions['v1'], "roles", role_id, related, "?page_size=50")
```
The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is due to the incorrect use of the `_urljoin` function.

To fix the bug, the corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:
```python
# this is the corrected function
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        url = self.api_server + "v1/roles/" + str(role_id) + "/" + related
        data = self._call_galaxy(url + "?page_size=50")
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = self.api_server + data['next_link']
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                     % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```
