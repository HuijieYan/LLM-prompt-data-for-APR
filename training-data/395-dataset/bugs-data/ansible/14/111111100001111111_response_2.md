The error seems to be occurring in the `fetch_role_related` method of the `GalaxyAPI` class. This method is intended to fetch the related items for a given role from the Ansible Galaxy server. The `url` construction in this method seems to be incorrect, which may be causing the wrong version to be fetched.

The bug is likely happening because the `url` is constructed using the wrong base URL, which affects the version of the role being fetched. This is likely causing the older version (3.6.3) to be fetched instead of the latest version (3.7.0). The issue may also be related to how the `related` field is being used to construct the URL.

To fix this bug, the `fetch_role_related` method should be updated with the correct logic for constructing the URL and fetching the data. Additionally, the `related` parameter should be used properly to ensure the correct versions of the role are fetched.

Here's the corrected code for the `fetch_role_related` method:

```python
# corrected function
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """
    results = []
    try:
        url = _urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions['v1'], "roles", str(role_id), related) + "?page_size=50"
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        while data.get('next_link'):
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s" % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```

In this corrected code, the `url` construction has been modified to use the correct base URL and the role ID. The iteration process for fetching the data has also been updated to ensure all related items are fetched.

It is recommended to test this corrected code with the provided test cases to ensure that the correct versions of the role are being fetched.
