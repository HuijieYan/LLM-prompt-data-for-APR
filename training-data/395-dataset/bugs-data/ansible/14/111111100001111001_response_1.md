The bug is in the function `fetch_role_related` inside the method signature `@g_connect(['v1'])`. This is not a valid way to decorate a method with `@`. 

The actual error is due to the hard-coded URL ('https://galaxy.com/api/') in the function urljoin, which should be replaced by `self.api_server`. 

Additionally, there's a typo in the query generation inside the `fetch_role_related` function. The query should be `"?page=2&page_size=50"` instead of `"?page_size=50"`.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
# ... omitted code ...

  
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        url = _urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions['v1'], "roles", role_id, related,
                       "?page=2&page_size=50")  # fixed query generation
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                     % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```
Please note that the `_urljoin` function receives the `self.api_server` as one of its arguments.
