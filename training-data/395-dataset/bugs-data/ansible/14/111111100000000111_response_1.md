The error seems to be related to the incorrect installation of an older version of the `geerlingguy.php` role from Ansible Galaxy instead of the latest version. The error has been reported while using the `ansible-galaxy` command in various environments. It seems that the wrong version is being pulled from the Galaxy API.

The bug is likely in the `fetch_role_related` method of the `GalaxyAPI` class. The `g_connect` decorator is used incorrectly, and the `fetch_role_related` method is not getting the latest version as expected.

To fix the bug, the `g_connect` decorator should be removed from the `fetch_role_related` method. Additionally, the `available_api_versions` and `_call_galaxy` methods should be properly called to get the latest version of the role.

Here's the corrected code for the `fetch_role_related` method:

```python
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        api_versions = self.available_api_versions()  # Properly call the available_api_versions method
        url = _urljoin(self.api_server, api_versions['v1'], "roles", role_id, related, "?page_size=50")  # Use api_versions to get the latest version
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)  # Properly call the _call_galaxy method
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrive role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                     % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```

By making these changes, the `fetch_role_related` method should now correctly fetch the latest version of the role from Ansible Galaxy.
