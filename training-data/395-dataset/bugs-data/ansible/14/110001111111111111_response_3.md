The error in the code seems to be related to the construction of the URL in the `fetch_role_related` method. The `url` is being constructed using `_urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions['v1'], "roles", role_id, related, "?page_size=50")`, but it seems to be appending an extra `/api` in the URL. This extra `/api` is likely causing the incorrect URL generation.

The `fetch_role_related` method should construct the URL without appending the extra `/api`. The correct URL should be `'https://galaxy.com/api/v1/roles/432/versions/?page_size=50'` instead of `'https://galaxy.com/api/api/v1/roles/432/versions/?page_size=50'`.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the URL construction in the `fetch_role_related` method to remove the extra `/api`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """
    results = []
    try:
        url = _urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions['v1'], "roles", str(role_id), related) + "/?page_size=50"
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv(f"Unable to retrieve role (id={role_id}) data ({related}), but this is not fatal so we continue: {to_text(e)}")
    return results
```

This corrected code should remove the issue of the extra `/api` in the URL construction. It should now correctly construct the URL as expected, resolving the bug.
