The bug is related to the incorrect construction of the URL in the `fetch_role_related` method. The error message shows that it's comparing two URLs and one of them has an extra `/api` string. This discrepancy could be causing the bug.

The bug occurs because the `_urljoin` function is appending `/api` to the URL, while the `fetch_role_related` method is also appending `/api` in the URL construction.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `fetch_role_related` method to remove the unnecessary `/api`:

```python
# corrected function
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    results = []
    try:
        url = _urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions['v1'], "roles", str(role_id), related,
                       "?page_size=50")
        # Remove `/api` from the constructed URL
        url = url.replace('/api', '')  
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrive role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                     % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```

By removing the `/api` from the constructed URL, the bug should be fixed, and the test case should pass without any errors.
