The issue seems to be related to the fetching of the role versions from the Ansible Galaxy API. The reported problem is that an older version of the role (`3.6.3`) is being installed instead of the latest version (`3.7.0`). This problem is occurring when the role is installed without specifying a version.

Upon analyzing the provided code, it seems that the issue may be related to the construction of the API request URL inside the `fetch_role_related` function. The API call is fetching the related items for a role, and this includes the role version. However, the URL construction might be incorrect, leading to the API returning an older version of the role.

The current code constructs the URL using `_urljoin` and then passes it to the `_call_galaxy` function for fetching data. The URL construction seems to be the potential source of the bug.

To fix the bug, the URL construction should be improved to ensure that the correct version of the role is fetched from the Ansible Galaxy API. Additionally, error handling and logging within the function could also be improved for better debuggability.

Here's the corrected code for the `fetch_role_related` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

# Corrected function
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        url = urljoin(self.api_server, f"api/v1/roles/{role_id}/{related}/?page_size=50")
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        while data.get('next_link'):
            url = urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv(f"Unable to retrieve role (id={role_id}) data ({related}), but this is not fatal so we continue: {to_text(e)}")
    return results
```

In the corrected function, the URL construction has been simplified, and the `while` loop for fetching paginated data has been updated to use `data.get('next_link')` directly. Additionally, error handling and logging would need to be adjusted based on the broader context of the code.
