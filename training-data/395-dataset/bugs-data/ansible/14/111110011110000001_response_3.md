The error occurs at the line `assert mock_open.mock_calls[1][1][0] == 'https://galaxy.com/api/v1/roles/432/versions/?page=2&page_size=50'` in the test function. The error message indicates that the URL being tested is not as expected, and it shows a difference related to the API path.

Potential error location within the problematic function:
The `_urljoin` function is supposed to join the provided URL segments into a complete URL. However, it seems that the function is not handling the base URL and the relative path correctly, leading to the incorrect URL construction.

Reasons behind the bug:
The `_urljoin` function might not be joining the URL segments properly, resulting in the improper formation of the final URL with the correct base API path.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. The `self.available_api_versions['v1']` call is treating `self.available_api_versions` as a dictionary instead of a function. It might be that the `available_api_versions` method should be invoked with parentheses, like `self.available_api_versions()['v1']`.
2. The `_urljoin` function might be implemented incorrectly and should be updated to properly join the URL segments.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """
    results = []
    try:
        url = self._urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions()['v1'], "roles", role_id, related,
                           "?page_size=50")
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = self._urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                     % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```
