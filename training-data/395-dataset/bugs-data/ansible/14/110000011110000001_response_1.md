The error that arises is due to the incorrect URL being formed in the `fetch_role_related` method. The error message highlights that the expected URL is "https://galaxy.com/api/v1/roles/432/versions/?page=2&page_size=50" but the actual URL is "https://galaxy.com/api/api/v1/roles/432/versions/?page=2&page_size=50". This discrepancy is due to an extra "api" present in the actual URL.

The bug in the `fetch_role_related` method seems to be in the `_urljoin` function call where the API server and available API versions are not properly concatenated to form the URL.

To fix this bug, the `_urljoin` function should correctly concatenate the three parts of the URL to form a valid URL.

Here's the fixed `fetch_role_related` method:

```python
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    results = []
    try:
        url = "/".join([self.api_server, "api", self.available_api_versions['v1'], "roles", str(role_id), related]) + "/?page_size=50"
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = self.api_server + data['next_link']
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrive role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                     % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```

With this correction, the URLs formed within the method will be accurate and the bug will be resolved.
