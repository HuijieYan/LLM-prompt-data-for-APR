The error message in the test function is related to the incorrect URL being generated in the `fetch_role_related` function.

The bug is occurring because the `fetch_role_related` function is not utilizing the `available_api_versions` function properly to construct the URL. As a result, it's leading to a mismatch in the generated URLs causing the assertion error in the test.

To fix the bug, the `fetch_role_related` function should use the `available_api_versions` function to construct the URL.

Here's the corrected code for the `fetch_role_related` function:

```python
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        api_version = self.available_api_versions()['v1']  # Using available_api_versions to get the API version
        url = _urljoin(self.api_server, api_version, "roles", str(role_id), related, "?page_size=50")  # Constructing the URL using available API version
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                     % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```

With this corrected code, the `fetch_role_related` function now correctly uses the `available_api_versions` function, ensuring that the correct API version is used to construct the URL.
