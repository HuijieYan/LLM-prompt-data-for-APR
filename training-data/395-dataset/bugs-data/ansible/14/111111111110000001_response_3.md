The bug in the `fetch_role_related` function is related to the url formation where it's calling the `_urljoin` function but not providing the correct parameters to form the url. The test case identified this issue when it tried to assert the generated URL.

One of the main issues is that the 'available_api_versions' method is declared, but its definition is not provided.

To fix this bug, the 'available_api_versions' method should be defined to return the available API versions.

After defining the 'available_api_versions' method, the 'fetch_role_related' method should use this method to get the available API versions and form the URL using the correct API version.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
class GalaxyAPI():
    # ... other methods ...

    def available_api_versions(self):
        # define this method to return the available API versions
        return ['v1']

    @g_connect(available_api_versions())
    def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
        # ... other code ...

        url = _urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions()[0], "roles", role_id, related, "?page_size=50")
        # use the available API version obtained from the available_api_versions method

        # ... other code ...
```

With the above changes, the fetch_role_related function will use the available_api_versions method to get the available API versions and form the URL using the correct API version. This should fix the bug.
