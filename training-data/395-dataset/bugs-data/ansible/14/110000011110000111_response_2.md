The error message indicates that the URL being generated in the test case does not match the expected URL, causing an assertion error.

The potential error in the `fetch_role_related` function is with the `_urljoin` function, which seems to be generating the incorrect URL.

The issue might be occurring due to incorrect concatenation of the URL components in the `_urljoin` function. The function should properly join the URL components provided to it.

To fix the bug, the `_urljoin` function needs to be modified to correctly join the URL components.

Here's the corrected `fetch_role_related` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

@g_connect(['v1'])
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        url = urljoin(self.api_server, f'api/v1/roles/{role_id}/{related}/?page_size=50')
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv(f"Unable to retrieve role (id={role_id}) data ({related}), but this is not fatal so we continue: {to_text(e)}")
    return results
```

In the corrected code, the `urljoin` function from the `urllib.parse` module is used to join the URL components. The `urljoin` function takes care of correctly concatenating the URL components and handling any extra slashes or missing components.
