The error message from the test function is indicating a mismatch in the URL being generated. The expected URL is `'https://galaxy.com/api/v1/roles/432/versions/?page=2&page_size=50'` but the actual URL is `'https://galaxy.com/api/api/v1/roles/432/versions/?page=2&page_size=50'`. This suggests that there is an issue with the way the URL is being constructed inside the `fetch_role_related` function.

The bug seems to be related to how the URL is being joined. It appears that the function `_urljoin` might not be correctly handling the base URL when joining the new path. It's adding an extra `/api` in the URL.

To fix the bug, one approach is to use the `urljoin` function from the `urllib.parse` module, which is a standard library in Python for handling URLs.

Here's the corrected code for the `fetch_role_related` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

@g_connect(['v1'])
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The URL comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        url = urljoin(self.api_server, f"{self.available_api_versions['v1']}/roles/{role_id}/{related}/?page_size=50")
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv(f"Unable to retrieve role (id={role_id}) data ({related}), but this is not fatal so we continue: {to_text(e)}")
    return results
```

This change should address the bug and ensure that the URLs are constructed correctly.
