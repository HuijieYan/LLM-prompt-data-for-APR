The error occurs in the `fetch_role_related` function when the `url` is constructed using the `_urljoin` function. The `self.available_api_versions` should be accessed as a dict instead of a method.

To fix this bug, the `fetch_role_related` function should be modified to use `self.available_api_versions` as a dict, and the url construction should be updated accordingly.

Here's the corrected `fetch_role_related` function:

```python
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        url = _urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions['v1'], "roles", role_id, related,
                       "?page_size=50")
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions['v1'], "roles", role_id, related,
                           "?page=2&page_size=50")
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                     % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```

In this corrected function, the `url` construction has been updated to handle potential pagination correctly, and the `self.available_api_versions` is accessed as a dict. This should fix the bug reported in the test case.
