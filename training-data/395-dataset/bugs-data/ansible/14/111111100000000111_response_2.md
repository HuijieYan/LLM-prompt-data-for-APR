The issue described seems to be related to the Ansible Galaxy API not returning the latest version of a role when using the `ansible-galaxy install` command. The behavior is inconsistent across different operating systems even though the same version of Ansible is being used in each environment.

Based on the error message and the provided code, the potential error location within the problematic function is in the `fetch_role_related` function of the `GalaxyAPI` class. This function is responsible for fetching the list of related items for a given role, and it constructs the URL using the `self.available_api_versions['v1']` attribute, which appears to be incorrect based on the error report that the older version is being installed.

The root cause of the bug may be that the `fetch_role_related` function is not correctly constructing the URL to fetch the latest version of the role from the Ansible Galaxy API. This can lead to the incorrect version being installed.

To fix this bug, the `fetch_role_related` function should be modified to construct the URL using the correct API endpoint for fetching the latest version of the role.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# corrected code for the fetch_role_related function
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        url = _urljoin(self.api_server, "v1", "roles", role_id, related, "?page_size=50")
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                     % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```

In the corrected code, the `fetch_role_related` function constructs the URL using the correct API endpoint "v1" for fetching the latest version of the role. This should resolve the issue where the older version of the role is being installed.
