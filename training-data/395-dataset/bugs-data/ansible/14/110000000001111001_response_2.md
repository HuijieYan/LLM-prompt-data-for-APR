The bug in the provided function is associated with the construction of the 'url' variable. The '_urljoin' method is used to join different parts of the URL, but it seems to be incorrectly constructing the URL with multiple occurrences of '/api'.

The bug occurs because the 'url' variable is constructed using _urljoin method in an incorrect way, leading to repetitive '/api' in the URL.

To fix this bug, we can modify the construction of the 'url' variable. Since the 'api_server' and 'available_api_versions' are used to construct the URL, we need to ensure that the URL is properly formed without duplicate occurrences of '/api'.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        url = urljoin(self.api_server, urljoin(self.available_api_versions['v1'] + "/", f"roles/{role_id}/{related}/?page_size=50"))
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv(f"Unable to retrieve role (id={role_id}) data ({related}), but this is not fatal so we continue: {to_text(e)}")
    return results
```
