The error message in the test function is indicating that the URL being generated within the fetch_role_related function does not match the expected URL. The call to _urljoin needs to be corrected to generate the correct URL.

The potential error location is within the fetch_role_related function, specifically where the URL is being generated using the _urljoin function.

The original URL generation is using `self.available_api_versions['v1']`, which should be `self.available_api_versions()` instead. This bug is likely causing the incorrect URL generation.

To fix the bug, the fetch_role_related function should be modified to correctly call self.available_api_versions() to get the URL for the available API version.

Here's the corrected code for the fetch_role_related function:

```python
    def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
        """
        Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
        The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
        """
    
        results = []
        try:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions()['v1'], "roles", role_id, related,
                           "?page_size=50")
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results = data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
            while not done:
                url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
                data = self._call_galaxy(url)
                results += data['results']
                done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        except Exception as e:
            display.vvvv("Unable to retrive role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                         % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
        return results
```

The corrected code should retrieve the URL from available_api_versions() correctly and use it for the URL generation in fetch_role_related.
