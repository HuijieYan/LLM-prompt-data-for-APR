The test case `test_get_role_versions_pagination` is related to the error message, as it expects the 'fetch_role_related' function to make the correct API call and handle pagination properly.

The potential error location within the 'fetch_role_related' function is the construction of the URL using the '_urljoin' function. The error message indicates that the URL construction is incorrect.

The bug occurs because the URL construction in the 'fetch_role_related' function is not handled properly. This results in an incorrect URL being generated for the API call.

To fix the bug, the URL construction logic needs to be corrected to ensure that it constructs the correct URLs for the API calls, especially when handling pagination.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

# class declaration containing the corrected function
class GalaxyAPI():
    """
    This class is meant to be used as a API client for an Ansible Galaxy server 
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def available_api_versions(self):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def _call_galaxy(self, url, args=None, headers=None, method=None, auth_required=False, error_context_msg=None):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass


    # the corrected function
    @g_connect(['v1'])
    def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
        """
        Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
        The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
        """
    
        results = []
        try:
            url = urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions()['v1'], f"roles/{role_id}/{related}/?page_size=50")
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results = data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
            while not done:
                url = urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
                data = self._call_galaxy(url)
                results += data['results']
                done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        except Exception as e:
            display.vvvv(f"Unable to retrieve role (id={role_id}) data ({related}), but this is not fatal so we continue: {to_text(e)}")
        return results
