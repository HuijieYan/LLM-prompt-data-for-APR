The issue with the given function is that it is attempting to access `self.available_api_versions` as a dictionary which it is not. It needs to access the method `available_api_versions`.

Description:
In the buggy function `fetch_role_related`, the code tries to access the `self.available_api_versions` as if it is a dictionary. However, the `available_api_versions` is a method, not a dictionary.

Approach:
To fix this issue, we need to call the `available_api_versions` method instead of accessing it directly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class GalaxyAPI():
    """
    This class is meant to be used as a API client for an Ansible Galaxy server 
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def available_api_versions(self):
        # ... omitted code ...
        return {'v1': 'v1'}


    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def _call_galaxy(self, url, args=None, headers=None, method=None, auth_required=False, error_context_msg=None):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass



    # this is the corrected function
    def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
        """
        Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
        The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
        """
    
        results = []
        try:
            api_versions = self.available_api_versions()
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, api_versions['v1'], "roles", role_id, related, "?page_size=50")
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results = data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
            while not done:
                url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
                data = self._call_galaxy(url)
                results += data['results']
                done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        except Exception as e:
            display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                         % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
        return results
```

The above implementation handles the buggy behavior by correctly calling the `available_api_versions` method and using its return value as a dictionary. It should resolve the issue and execute as expected.
