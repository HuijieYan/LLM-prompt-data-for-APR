The error occurs when the `fetch_role_related` function constructs the URL using the `self.api_server` and `self.available_api_versions['v1']` values. The issue arises when the URL is constructed with an additional 'api' in the path.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly construct the URL using the provided values. The URL components should be joined using the `_urljoin` function to prevent such issues.

Here's the corrected code for the `fetch_role_related` function:

```python
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    results = []
    try:
        url = _urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions['v1'], "roles", str(role_id), related, "?page_size=50")
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                     % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```

By using the `_urljoin` function, the URL construction for the `fetch_role_related` function is fixed. This should resolve the issue encountered in the test case.
