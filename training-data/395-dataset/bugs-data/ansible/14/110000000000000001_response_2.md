Potential error location: The error could be at the `_urljoin` function call where the `page_size` parameter is not being properly formatted as part of the URL.

Reason for the bug: The bug could be due to the incorrect formatting of the URL when adding the `page_size` parameter, leading to an invalid URL being generated.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The `_urljoin` function should be checked to ensure that the URL and parameters are concatenated correctly to form a valid URL.

Corrected code:

```python
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        url = f"{self.api_server}/{self.available_api_versions['v1']}/roles/{role_id}/{related}/?page_size=50"
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv(f"Unable to retrive role (id={role_id}) data ({related}), but this is not fatal so we continue: {to_text(e)}")
    return results
```
