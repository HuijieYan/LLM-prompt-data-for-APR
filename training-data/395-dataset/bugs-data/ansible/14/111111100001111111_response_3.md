The bug in the provided code is related to the construction of the URL in the `fetch_role_related` method of the `GalaxyAPI` class. The URL is constructed using the `self.available_api_versions['v1']` attribute, which should be a function, but it is assigned a dictionary instead. This leads to incorrect construction of the URL, causing the older version of the role to be installed.

To fix this bug, the `available_api_versions` function should be called instead of accessing it as a dictionary.

The corrected code for the `fetch_role_related` method is as follows:

```python
# corrected function
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        api_version = self.available_api_versions()['v1']
        url = _urljoin(self.api_server, api_version, "roles", role_id, related, "?page_size=50")
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv(
            "Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
            % (role_id, related, to_text(e))
        )
    return results
```

By calling the `available_api_versions` function and using the returned value as `api_version`, we ensure that the correct API version is used to construct the URL. This should resolve the issue of older versions of the role being installed, as reported in the GitHub issue.
