The error seems to be occurring in the construction of the `url` variable in the `fetch_role_related` function. The function uses the `_urljoin` function to construct the URL, however, it seems that the url is being joined incorrectly, as evident from the error message and the expected value for `url` in Expected case 2. 

Possible reasons for the bug:
1. The `_urljoin` function might have a bug.
2. The presence of an extra `/api` in the buggy function in the url construction.

Proposed approach for fixing the bug:
1. It seems that an extra `/api` is being added in the URL construction. This issue can be resolved by removing `/api` from the URL construction.

Here's the corrected code for the `fetch_role_related` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        url = _urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions['v1'], "roles", role_id, related, "?page_size=50")
        url = url.replace('/api/api', '/api')  # Remove extra '/api' if present
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                     % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```

This corrected code includes a line `url = url.replace('/api/api', '/api')` to remove the extra '/api' from the constructed URL. This should address the issue observed in the test case.
