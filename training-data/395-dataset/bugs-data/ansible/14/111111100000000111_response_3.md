Potential error location: The issue appears to be with the `fetch_role_related` function inside the `GalaxyAPI` class.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug seems to stem from the incorrect handling of API versions and URL construction, which leads to the wrong version of the role being downloaded.

Approaches for fixing the bug: The `fetch_role_related` function needs to correctly handle the API version and construct the URL based on the available API versions.

Corrected code:

```python
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """
    
    results = []
    try:
        api_versions = self.available_api_versions()  # Call the available_api_versions function to get the API versions
        url = _urljoin(self.api_server, api_versions['v1'], "roles", role_id, related, "?page_size=50")  # Fixed URL construction
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                     % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```

In the corrected code, the `available_api_versions` function is called to get the available API versions, and the URL construction is fixed to use the correct API version. This should resolve the issue with incorrect versions of the role being downloaded.
