The error is occurring because the `url` variable is being constructed incorrectly in the `fetch_role_related` method of the `GalaxyAPI` class. The `available_api_versions` is a method, but it's being treated as a dictionary.

To fix this bug:
- Modify the `@g_connect(['v1'])` decorator to a normal method call within the `fetch_role_related` method.
- Pass the `versions` parameter to the `g_connect` method as a normal parameter instead of using the decorator.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id, versions=['v1']):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        api_versions = self.available_api_versions()
        url = _urljoin(self.api_server, api_versions.get(versions[0]), "roles", role_id, related, "?page_size=50")
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                     % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```

In this corrected code, the `g_connect` function is removed, and the `versions` parameter is moved to the argument list of the `fetch_role_related` method. The `available_api_versions` method is called to retrieve the API versions, and the correct version is used to construct the `url` variable.
