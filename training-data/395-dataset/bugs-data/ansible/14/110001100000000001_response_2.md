The potential error in the given code is the use of the decorator `@g_connect(['v1'])` before the `fetch_role_related` function. Decorators are normally used to modify or enhance the behavior of functions, but in this case, it is being used incorrectly.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the decorator `@g_connect(['v1'])` is being used incorrectly. Decorators are meant to be applied to functions, but the `g_connect` function is expecting a `versions` argument, which is not being passed properly in the decorator usage.

To fix the bug, the `@g_connect(['v1'])` decorator should be removed and the function `fetch_role_related` should be defined as a regular method. The `g_connect` function should be called inside the `fetch_role_related` method and passed with the `['v1']` argument.

Here's the corrected code for the `fetch_role_related` method:

```python
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        g_connect(['v1'])  # Call g_connect function here
        url = _urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions['v1'], "roles", role_id, related,
                       "?page_size=50")
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrive role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                     % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```
