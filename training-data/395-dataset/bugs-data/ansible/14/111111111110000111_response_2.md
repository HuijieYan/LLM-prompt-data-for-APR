The error message from the test function indicates that the URL being generated and called in the `fetch_role_related` function is incorrect. Specifically, the URL being called is 'https://galaxy.com/api/api/v1/roles/432/versions/?page=2&page_size=50', which should be 'https://galaxy.com/api/v1/roles/432/versions/?page=2&page_size=50'.

The bug is occurring in the `fetch_role_related` function due to the incorrect generation of the URL using the `_urljoin` function. This incorrect URL generation is causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, the `fetch_role_related` function needs to correctly generate the URL using `_urljoin` and call the `_call_galaxy` function with the correct URL.

Here's the corrected `fetch_role_related` function:

```python
class GalaxyAPI():
    # ... omitted code ...

    def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
        results = []
        try:
            url = self._urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions()['v1'], "roles", str(role_id), related, "?page_size=50")
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results = data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
            while not done:
                url = self._urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
                data = self._call_galaxy(url)
                results += data['results']
                done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        except Exception as e:
            display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                         % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
        return results
```

With this correction, the URL will be generated correctly using the `_urljoin` function, and the `_call_galaxy` function will be called with the correct URL.
