Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is in the fetch_role_related function where the _urljoin and _call_galaxy functions are being called.

Reasons for the Bug:
1. The @g_connect(['v1']) decorator is not a valid syntax for connecting to a function. It seems to be attempting to be used as a decorator, but the decorator should be defined separately and applied using the @ symbol before the function definition.
2. There is a misspelling in the method name, should be g_connet instead of g_connect.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Remove the @g_connect(['v1']) decorator from the function definition and correct the spelling of the method name to g_connect.
2. Define the decorator separately if it is necessary and apply it using @ symbol before the function definition.

Corrected Code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/ansible_14/lib/ansible/galaxy/api.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def g_connect(versions):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def _urljoin(*args):

# relative function's signature in this file
def _call_galaxy(self, url, args=None, headers=None, method=None, auth_required=False, error_context_msg=None):

# Corrected and fixed function
