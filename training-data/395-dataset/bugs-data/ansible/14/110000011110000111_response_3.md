The error in the test is due to the incorrect URL being generated by the `fetch_role_related` function. This is because the function is not properly handling the construction of the next link URL, which results in the incorrect URL for the second response.

The bug occurs because the function incorrectly constructs the URL for the next page of results, causing the test to fail due to a mismatch in the expected and actual URLs.

To fix the bug, the function should properly construct the next link URL using the `_urljoin` function for both the initial URL and subsequent pages.

Here's the corrected code for the `fetch_role_related` function:

```python
@g_connect(['v1'])
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        url = _urljoin(self.api_server, "api/v1", "roles", role_id, related)  # Modified this line
        url += "?page_size=50"  # Modified this line
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        while 'next_link' in data and data['next_link']:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])  # Modified this line
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                     % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```

With these modifications, the `fetch_role_related` method will properly construct the next link URL, which should resolve the issue and make the test case successful.
