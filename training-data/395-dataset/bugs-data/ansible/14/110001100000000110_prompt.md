# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
Ansible Galaxy installing older version of role if none specified (for geerlingguy.php)
```

## The associated detailed issue description
```text
SUMMARY
Tonight many of my roles started failing CI tests, and after an hour or so I tracked down the problem to an old version of the geerlingguy.php role being installed. The current version on Galaxy (see https://galaxy.ansible.com/geerlingguy/php) is 3.7.0.

But Molecule was downloading the release prior to that, 3.6.3.

I also tested manually installing the role (without specifying a version) on two other fresh environmentsâ€”in both cases, it still downloaded the old not-current version, 3.6.3.

So... either the Galaxy API and the Galaxy UI are out of sync, or something is wrong with Ansible's ansible-galaxy command, and it's causing older-than-latest versions of at least one role to be downloaded...

ISSUE TYPE
Bug Report
COMPONENT NAME
ansible-galaxy

ANSIBLE VERSION
ansible 2.9.0
  config file = None
  configured module search path = [u'/root/.ansible/plugins/modules', u'/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
  ansible python module location = /usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/ansible
  executable location = /usr/local/bin/ansible
  python version = 2.7.15+ (default, Oct  7 2019, 17:39:04) [GCC 7.4.0]
CONFIGURATION
N/A (no changes)
OS / ENVIRONMENT
Ubuntu 18.04: fail (3.6.3)
Ubuntu 16.04: fail (3.6.3)
Debian 10: fail (3.6.3)
Debian 9: fail (3.6.3)
Debian 8: success (3.7.0)
CentOS 8: success (3.7.0)
CentOS 7: fail (3.6.3)
Ansible 2.9.0 was used in each environment, installed via Pip. Very weird. I even ran the test in a fresh new Debian 8 and CentOS 8 environment 3 times each, and it was successful every time. And I ran the other tests at least twice each and they failed every time... so it doesn't seem to be a cache-related issue in the API.

STEPS TO REPRODUCE
ansible-galaxy install geerlingguy.php
EXPECTED RESULTS
The latest version of the role (3.7.0) should be installed.

ACTUAL RESULTS
An older version of the role (3.6.3) was installed.

Note that the proper version was installed on CentOS 8 and Debian 8... but none of the other OSes I tested, all confirmed to be running Ansible 2.9.0, installed via Pip.
