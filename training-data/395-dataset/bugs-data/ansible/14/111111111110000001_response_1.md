The error occurs in the test function where it compares two URLs and finds that they don't match exactly due to a slight variation in the URL format.

The issue originates from the `fetch_role_related` function, specifically in the `url` construction. The problem seems to be caused by the way `_urljoin` combines the URL components and the mistaken usage of the `self.available_api_versions['v1']`. It should be `self.available_api_versions()['v1']`.

To fix the issue, the `fetch_role_related` function should be updated as follows:

```python
# this is the fixed function
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        url = _urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions()['v1'], "roles", role_id, related, "?page_size=50")
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                     % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```
