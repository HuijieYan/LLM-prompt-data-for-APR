The potential error location within the problematic function is the `@g_connect(['v1'])` decorator. This decorator is not defined in the given code and its purpose is not clear, which indicates that it could be causing the error. 

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could be to remove the `@g_connect(['v1'])` decorator or to define the `@g_connect` decorator with its intended functionality.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
# this is the corrected function
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        url = _urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions()['v1'], "roles", role_id, related,
                       "?page_size=50")
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                     % (role_id, related, str(e)))
    return results
```
