The bug in the provided function `fetch_role_related` is that the `@g_connect(['v1'])` decorator is not used correctly. Also, the `self.available_api_versions` is used as a dictionary, but it should be used as a method.

The error message indicates that the incorrect version of the role is being installed, which aligns with the incorrect URL being generated in the `fetch_role_related` function. The function is using the wrong version to construct the URL when fetching role data, leading to the incorrect role version being retrieved.

To fix the bug, the `@g_connect(['v1'])` decorator should be removed from the function definition, and the `self.available_api_versions` should be called as a method. Additionally, the URL construction logic may need to be updated to correctly include the version of the role being fetched.

Here's the corrected code for the `fetch_role_related` function:

```python
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id, version='v1'):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        api_version = self.available_api_versions()[version]
        url = _urljoin(self.api_server, api_version, "roles", role_id, related, "?page_size=50")
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                     % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```

In the corrected code, the decorator `@g_connect(['v1'])` has been removed from the function definition. The `self.available_api_versions['v1']` has been replaced with `self.available_api_versions()['v1']` to correctly call the method and retrieve the version. Additionally, a default parameter `version='v1'` has been added to the function signature for flexibility.
