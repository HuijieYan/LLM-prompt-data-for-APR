The bug in the provided function is related to the url construction and concatenation part. The use of `_urljoin` function is incorrect and leading to incorrect url formation. This results in the wrong url being used to fetch data from the API, leading to incorrect data retrieval or possible errors.

To fix the bug, the correct url formation should be done using the available information such as self.api_server, self.available_api_versions, "roles", role_id, related, and query parameters like "page_size".

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    
    try:
        url = urljoin(self.api_server, f"{self.available_api_versions['v1']}/roles/{role_id}/{related}/?page_size=50")
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        
        while not done:
            url = urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv(f"Unable to retrieve role (id={role_id}) data ({related}), but this is not fatal so we continue: {to_text(e)}")
    
    return results
```

This corrected code utilizes the `urljoin` function from the `urllib.parse` module to construct the correct URL for the API call. It uses the base API server url, available API version, role_id, related item, and query parameters to form the complete URL.
