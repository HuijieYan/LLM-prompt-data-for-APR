The error in the code seems to be related to the construction of the `url` variable inside the `fetch_role_related` method. When pagination is required, the URL is not being constructed correctly, resulting in an incorrect URL.

To fix the bug, you should make sure that the `url` variable is constructed correctly, considering the cases where pagination is needed. The URL should include the correct version and page size parameters.

Here is the corrected code for the `fetch_role_related` method:

```python
    # this is the corrected function
    @g_connect(['v1'])
    def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
        """
        Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
        The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
        """
    
        results = []
        try:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions['v1'], "roles", role_id, related)
            url += "?page_size=50"  # append the page size parameter
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results = data['results']
            while data.get('next_link'):  # check for pagination
                url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
                data = self._call_galaxy(url)
                results += data['results']
        except Exception as e:
            display.vvvv("Unable to retrive role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                         % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
        return results
```

This fix should correctly handle the construction of the `url` variable, including pagination when necessary. This should address the issue described in the test case and the associated GitHub issue.
