The bug occurs in the method `fetch_role_related` of the class `GalaxyAPI`. The method is using the `@g_connect(['v1'])` decorator, which is incorrect and is likely causing the unexpected behavior.

The reason for the bug is that the `fetch_role_related` method is not being decorated correctly, and as a result, it is not handling the API request properly.

To fix the bug, the `@g_connect(['v1'])` decorator should be removed from the `fetch_role_related` method, and the method should be rewritten to properly handle the API request.

Here's the corrected code for the `fetch_role_related` method:

```python
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """
    results = []
    try:
        url = self._urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions['v1'], "roles", role_id, related,
                           "?page_size=50")
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = self._urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                     % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```

By removing the incorrect decorator and fixing the method to use the `_urljoin` and `_call_galaxy` methods properly, the bug should be resolved.

The corrected code includes the appropriate usage of the `self._urljoin` and `self._call_galaxy` methods, as well as the correct error handling.
