The error in the `fetch_role_related` function seems to be related to fetching the role related items. The bug is likely occurring due to the incorrect API version being used to fetch the role related items. This is causing an older version of the role to be installed instead of the latest version.

To fix the bug, the `fetch_role_related` function needs to correctly fetch the latest version of the role related items from the Ansible Galaxy API.

Here is the corrected code for the `fetch_role_related` function:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class GalaxyAPI():
    """
    This class is meant to be used as a API client for an Ansible Galaxy server 
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def available_api_versions(self):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def _call_galaxy(self, url, args=None, headers=None, method=None, auth_required=False, error_context_msg=None):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass



    # this is the corrected function
    def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
        """
        Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
        The URL comes from the 'related' field of the role.
        """
        results = []
        try:
            # Assume v1 is the correct API version for fetching related items
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions()['v1'], "roles", role_id, related, "?page_size=50")
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results = data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
            while not done:
                url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
                data = self._call_galaxy(url)
                results += data['results']
                done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        except Exception as e:
            display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                         % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
        return results
```

In the corrected code, the `available_api_versions` function is correctly called as a method with `()` and the correct API version 'v1' is used to fetch the related items. This should ensure that the latest version of the role related items is fetched from the Ansible Galaxy API.
