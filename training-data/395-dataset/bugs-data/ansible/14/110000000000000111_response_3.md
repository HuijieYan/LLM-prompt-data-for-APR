The error does not seem to be related to the provided function, as it is a bug with the ansible-galaxy command not installing the latest version of a role. 

However, assuming that the bug is indeed related to the provided function `fetch_role_related`, the potential error location is likely in the URL generation and API call within the `fetch_role_related` function.

The bug could be occurring due to the URL generation or API call not fetching the latest version of the role. This could be due to issues with the URL construction or potential caching issues.

To fix the bug, the URL construction and API call logic should be reviewed to ensure it is fetching the correct and latest version of the role. Additionally, caching issues should be investigated if they are indeed affecting the API call.

Here's the corrected code for the `fetch_role_related` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """
    results = []
    try:
        url = urljoin(self.api_server, f"/{self.available_api_versions['v1']}/roles/{role_id}/{related}?page_size=50")
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        while 'next_link' in data:
            url = urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv(f"Unable to retrieve role (id={role_id}) data ({related}), but this is not fatal so we continue: {str(e)}")
    return results
```

In the corrected code, the `_urljoin` function is replaced with Python's built-in `urljoin`. The logic for fetching results from the API has been simplified to a more concise and readable format.
