The error message indicates an assertion error in the test case `test_get_role_versions_pagination`. The specific comparison causing the error is related to the URL construction, indicating that the construction of the URL in the `fetch_role_related` function is incorrect.

The error location is identified in the `fetch_role_related` function where the URL construction is being performed.

The issue arises from incorrect formatting or concatenation of the URL parts, resulting in an invalid URL being constructed.

To fix this issue, the URL construction logic needs to be revised to ensure that the correct concatenation and formatting of URL parts are done.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The URL comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """
    results = []
    try:
        url = _urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions()['v1'], "roles", role_id, related,
                       "?page_size=50")
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                     % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```

In the corrected code, the `available_api_versions` function is called to retrieve the API version correctly. Additionally, the URL construction logic is modified to ensure proper concatenation of URL parts.
