The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of a decorator `@g_connect(['v1'])` which is not defined in the code provided.

The potential reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the decorator `@g_connect(['v1'])` is not a valid decorator and is not defined anywhere in the code. This can result in a syntax error when trying to define the function.

To fix this bug, the decorator needs to be removed from the function definition. If the decorator is intended to be used for some specific functionality, it needs to be defined and implemented before it can be used.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class GalaxyAPI():
    """
    This class is meant to be used as a API client for an Ansible Galaxy server 
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def available_api_versions(self):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def _call_galaxy(self, url, args=None, headers=None, method=None, auth_required=False, error_context_msg=None):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass



    # this is the corrected function
    def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
        """
        Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
        The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
        """
    
        results = []
        try:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions['v1'], "roles", role_id, related,
                           "?page_size=50")
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results = data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
            while not done:
                url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
                data = self._call_galaxy(url)
                results += data['results']
                done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        except Exception as e:
            display.vvvv("Unable to retrive role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                         % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
        return results
