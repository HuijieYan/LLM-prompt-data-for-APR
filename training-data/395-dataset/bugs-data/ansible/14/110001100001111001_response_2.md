The issue with the code is related to the URL concatenation and the way request URLs are being formed.

The `_urljoin()` function does not properly join the arguments, leading to the creation of an incorrect URL. Also, the way the URL is being formed by concatenating the server URL, API version, roles, and related items does not seem to be correct.

To fix the bug and ensure proper URL construction, we should replace the `_urljoin()` function with Python's built-in `urljoin` function to properly join the URLs.

Additionally, the `available_api_versions` is a dictionary, so it should be accessed using square brackets instead of parentheses. For example, `self.available_api_versions['v1']` instead of `self.available_api_versions('v1')`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

@g_connect(['v1'])
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The URL comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        url = urljoin(self.api_server, urljoin(self.available_api_versions['v1'], f"roles/{role_id}/{related}/?page_size=50"))
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv(f"Unable to retrieve role (id={role_id}) data ({related}), but this is not fatal so we continue: {to_text(e)}")
    return results
```

By using the `urljoin` function, we can ensure proper URL construction and avoid concatenation errors. Additionally, we have updated the dictionary access for `self.available_api_versions` to use square brackets.
