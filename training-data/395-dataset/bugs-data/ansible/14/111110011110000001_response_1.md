The error seems to be related to the creation of the `url` variable in the `fetch_role_related` function. The error message indicates that the URL being formed is incorrect.

The reason behind the bug is the incorrect usage of the `_urljoin` function. It seems that it's being used incorrectly, leading to the wrong URL being generated.

To fix this bug, one possible approach is to use the `urljoin` function from the `urllib.parse` module, assuming that `_urljoin` is a custom function that mimics or wraps around `urljoin`. If this custom function has special behavior it should be reviewed to ensure that it generates the correct URLs.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function with the assumption that `_urljoin` is a custom function based on `urllib.parse.urljoin`:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

# ...

class GalaxyAPI():
    # ... (other functions, etc.) ...

    def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
        """
        Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
        The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
        """
        results = []
        try:
            url = urljoin(self.api_server, urljoin(self.available_api_versions['v1'], f"roles/{role_id}/{related}"))
            params = {'page_size': 50}
            data = self._call_galaxy(url, args=params)
            results = data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
            while not done:
                url = urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
                data = self._call_galaxy(url)
                results += data['results']
                done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        except Exception as e:
            display.vvvv(f"Unable to retrieve role (id={role_id}) data ({related}), but this is not fatal so we continue: {to_text(e)}")
        return results
```

In the corrected code:
- The `urljoin` function from the `urllib.parse` module is used to safely join the parts of the URL.
- The parameters are correctly passed to the `_call_galaxy` function, and the URL query parameter "page_size" has been correctly included in the `url`.
