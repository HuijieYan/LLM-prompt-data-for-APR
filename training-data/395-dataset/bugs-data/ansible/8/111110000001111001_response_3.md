The bug in the `join_path` function lies in the way the backslashes are handled in the input arguments. The function attempts to convert the backslashes to forward slashes and then splits the path based on the forward slashes, but it does not handle the double backslashes properly.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_unquote` function to handle the backslashes and also fix how the path is processed in the `join_path` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `join_path` function:

```python
def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        arg = arg.replace('\\\\', '\\').replace('/', '\\')
        parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\') if a])
    path = '\\'.join(parts)
    if path.startswith('~'):
        return path
    return path
```

This code fixes the bug by first replacing all occurrences of double backslashes with single backslashes before replacing forward slashes with backslashes. Then, the code splits the path based on single backslashes and joins the parts using backslashes. This solution should handle the input paths correctly and return the expected results.
