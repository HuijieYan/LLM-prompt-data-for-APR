The identified issue with the function is that it is not properly handling the input arguments and joining the paths as intended. The function is also using the _unquote method, which is not clearly defined in the given code. It is assumed that the _unquote method is intended to remove quotes from a string, but it is not properly implemented.

The root cause of the bug is that the function is not handling the input arguments correctly and the logic for joining the paths is flawed.

To fix the bug, the function should properly handle the input arguments, remove unnecessary characters, and join the paths using the correct delimiters.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        arg = arg.replace('\\\\', '').replace('\\', '/').strip('/')
        parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('/') if a])
    path = '/'.join(parts)
    if path.startswith('~'):
        return path
    return path
```

With this corrected code, the function should properly handle the input arguments, remove unnecessary characters, and join the paths using the forward slash as the delimiter. This should resolve the issues identified in the buggy function.
