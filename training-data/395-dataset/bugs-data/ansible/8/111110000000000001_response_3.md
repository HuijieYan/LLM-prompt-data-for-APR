Potential error location: The potential error in the `join_path` function is with the `arg = self._unquote(arg).replace('/', '\\')` line. Here, the function `_unquote` is called without checking if it exists.

Reasons for the bug: The bug occurs because the `_unquote` function is called without verifying its existence, and this can cause an AttributeError if it does not exist.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Check if the `_unquote` function exists before calling it in the `join_path` function.

Corrected code:

```python
# class declaration containing the fixed function
class ShellModule(ShellBase):
    # ... omitted code ...


    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def _unquote(self, value):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def replace(m):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass



    # this is the fixed function
    def join_path(self, *args):
        parts = []
        for arg in args:
            if hasattr(self, '_unquote') and callable(getattr(self, '_unquote')):
                arg = self._unquote(arg).replace('/', '\\')
            parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\') if a])
        path = '\\'.join(parts)
        if path.startswith('~'):
            return path
        return path
```
