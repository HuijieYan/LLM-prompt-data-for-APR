The bug in the `join_path` function is caused by the incorrect handling of UNC (Universal Naming Convention) paths, which are used to access shared network resources. The incorrect handling of UNC paths leads to an incorrect path being formed and results in a "path not found" error when trying to access the file.

To fix the bug, the `_unquote` method is used to remove any quotes from the path and then the forward slashes are replaced with backslashes. Additionally, the leading double backslashes should be removed from the UNC path. 

The corrected code for the `join_path` function is as follows:

```python
def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        arg = self._unquote(arg).replace('/', '\\').strip('\\\\')
        parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\') if a])
    path = '\\'.join(parts)
    if path.startswith('~'):
        return path
    return path
```

This corrected code properly handles the UNC paths and should fix the issue with the fetch module failing to access files from remote servers.
