The provided test case `test_join_path_unc` attempts to call the `join_path` method of the `ShellModule` class with the input parameters `('\\\\host\\share\\dir1\\\\dir2\\', '\\dir3/dir4', 'dir5', 'dir6\\')`. The expected output is `'\\\\host\\share\\dir1\\dir2\\dir3\\dir4\\dir5\\dir6'`. However, the actual output is `'host\\share\\dir1\\dir2\\dir3\\dir4\\dir5\\dir6'`.

The bug is located within the `join_path` method of the `ShellModule` class. The bug appears to be caused by the incorrect splitting and joining of the `args` parameter. Additionally, the `_unquote` method and the replacement of slashes with backslashes are contributing to the incorrect result.

To fix the bug, the following steps can be taken:
1. Define a new variable `processed_args` to store the processed arguments.
2. Iterate through each argument in `args`, replace forward slashes with backslashes, split the argument using backslashes, and extend the `processed_args` list with the split parts.
3. Join the `processed_args` using backslashes and assign it to the `path` variable.
4. Return the `path` variable.

The corrected code for the `join_path` method is as follows:

```python
def join_path(self, *args):
    processed_args = []
    for arg in args:
        arg = arg.replace('/', '\\')
        processed_args.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\') if a])
    path = '\\\\'.join(processed_args)
    if path.startswith('\\\\'):
        return path
    return '\\' + path
```
