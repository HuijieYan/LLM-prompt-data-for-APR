The bug in the provided function join_path is likely caused by the improper handling of UNC paths, which are paths that begin with two backslashes. 

The function is currently using backslash as the path separator and does not handle UNC paths properly, resulting in incorrect path assembly.

To fix the bug, the function should properly handle UNC paths by checking for them and handling them as a special case.

Here's the corrected code for the join_path function:

```python
def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        arg = self._unquote(arg).replace('/', '\\')
        if arg.startswith('\\\\'):  # check for UNC path
            arg = arg.lstrip('\\')  # remove the initial backslashes in UNC path
            parts.extend(arg.split('\\'))  # split UNC path by backslashes
        else:
            parts.extend(arg.split('\\'))  # continue handling regular paths
    
    path = '\\'.join(parts)
    if path.startswith('~'):
        return path
    return path
```

With this correction, the function should now properly handle both regular paths and UNC paths, resulting in the correct assembly of the path.
