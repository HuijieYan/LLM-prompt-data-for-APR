The issue is related to the incorrect rendering of the UNC path in the fetch module. The join_path function in the ShellModule class is responsible for creating the path, and it seems to be causing the problem.

The bug is likely occurring because the current implementation of the join_path function is not handling UNC paths correctly, which is causing the fetch module to fail when trying to access the file using the rendered path.

To fix the bug, the join_path function needs to be modified to properly handle UNC paths by not modifying them and returning them as-is.

Here's the corrected code for the join_path function:

```python
def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        if arg.startswith('\\\\'):  # Check if the path is a UNC path
            parts.append(arg)
        else:
            arg = self._unquote(arg).replace('/', '\\')
            parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\') if a])
    path = '\\'.join(parts)
    if path.startswith('~'):
        return path
    return path
```

With this modification, the join_path function will now properly handle UNC paths and return them as-is without modifying them, which should resolve the issue with the fetch module failing to access the file using the rendered path.
