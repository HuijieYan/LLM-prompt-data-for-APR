The bug seems to be occurring in the `join_path` method of the `powershell.py` file. The function takes in multiple path components and joins them while replacing the forward slashes with backslashes.

The bug is likely due to the incorrect processing of UNC (Universal Naming Convention) paths, leading to a failure to fetch files from remote hosts using UNC paths.

To fix this bug, the `join_path` method needs to handle UNC paths properly and convert them into the correct format for processing on both local and remote filesystems.

Here's the corrected code for the `join_path` method:

```python
def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        arg = arg.replace('/', '\\\\')  # Replace forward slashes with double backslashes for UNC paths
        if arg.startswith('\\\\'):  # Check if the path is a UNC path
            parts.append(arg)  # Append the UNC path as it is
        else:
            arg = self._unquote(arg).replace('/', '\\')  # Process non-UNC paths as before
            parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\') if a])
    path = '\\\\'.join(parts)  # Join parts using double backslashes for UNC paths
    if path.startswith('\\\\'):
        return path
    else:
        return path.lstrip('\\')  # Remove leading backslashes for non-UNC paths
```

With this correction, the `join_path` method should be able to handle UNC paths properly and fix the issue related to fetching files from remote hosts using UNC paths.
