The issue in the given `join_path` function is that the backslashes are being replaced by forward slashes in the input arguments, and then the split method is being used on backslashes. This is resulting in incorrect path formation.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `join_path` function to correctly handle the input arguments and form the path.

Here's the corrected code for the `join_path` function:

```python
def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        arg = self._unquote(arg).replace('\\', '/').replace('//', '/')  # Replace double backslashes with single forward slashes
        parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('/') if a])  # Split using forward slashes
    path = '/'.join(parts)  # Join using forward slashes
    if path.startswith('~'):
        return path
    return path
```

By using forward slashes for splitting and joining the path, we can ensure that the path formation works correctly for both Windows and Unix-style paths.
