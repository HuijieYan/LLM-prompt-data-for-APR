Potential error location:
The issue seems to be with the handling of the UNC (Universal Naming Convention) path in the join_path function. It looks like the function is not correctly handling the double backslashes in the UNC path.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the _unquote() method is not correctly handling the double backslashes in the UNC path before replacing '/' with '\'.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
One approach to fix the bug is to update the _unquote() method to correctly handle the double backslashes in the UNC path and replace '\\' with '/' before the join_path function processes the paths.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class ShellModule(ShellBase):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _unquote(self, value):
        # Update the _unquote method to replace '\\' with '/'
        value = value.replace('\\\\', '/')
        # ... omitted code ...
        return value

    def join_path(self, *args):
        parts = []
        for arg in args:
            arg = self._unquote(arg).replace('/', '\\')
            parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\') if a])
        path = '\\'.join(parts)
        if path.startswith('~'):
            return path
        return path
```
