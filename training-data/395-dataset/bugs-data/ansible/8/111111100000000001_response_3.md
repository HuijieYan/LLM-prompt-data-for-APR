Potential error location: The call to self._unquote(arg) inside the join_path function is likely causing the bug as it's not calling the correct instance method.

Reasons behind the bug: The _unquote method is defined twice in the same class, which can cause confusion and the wrong method being called.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Remove the duplicate definition of the _unquote method in the ShellModule class to avoid confusion and ensure that the correct method is called.
2. Use the correct instance method to call the _unquote method by using self._unquote(arg) instead of calling it directly.

Corrected code:

```python
# corrected function
def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        arg = self._unquote(arg).replace('/', '\\')
        parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\') if a])
    path = '\\'.join(parts)
    if path.startswith('~'):
        return path
    return path
```
