Potential error location:
The issue seems to be with the handling of UNC (Universal Naming Convention) paths in the `join_path` function. The code is not correctly handling the UNC paths, leading to incorrect path rendering and subsequent errors.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
UNC paths require special handling due to their format, which starts with `\\`. The current code does not properly handle UNC paths, resulting in the incorrect rendering of paths and the subsequent "Path not found" error message.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the path starts with `\\` to identify UNC paths.
2. Modify the `join_path` function to handle UNC paths correctly by splitting and joining the path components.
3. Update the `_unquote` method to properly handle UNC paths and remove unnecessary characters.

Corrected code:

```python
def _unquote(self, value):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def replace(m):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        if arg.startswith('\\\\'):  # Check for UNC paths
            parts.extend(arg.strip('\\').split('\\'))  # Handle UNC paths
        else:
            arg = self._unquote(arg).replace('/', '\\')
            parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\') if a])
    path = '\\'.join(parts)
    if path.startswith('~'):
        return path
    return path
```

This corrected code includes the handling of UNC paths in the `join_path` function, ensuring that the paths are properly rendered and the fetch module can access the correct paths on the remote server.
