The error occurs because the join_path function is not handling the UNC paths correctly. It is replacing the forward slashes with backslashes without considering the UNC format.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the join_path function to handle UNC paths properly by checking for the double backslashes at the beginning of the path.

Here's the corrected code for the join_path function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        arg = arg.replace('/', '\\').replace('\\\\', '\\')  # Replace forward slashes and multiple backslashes
        parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\') if a])
    path = '\\'.join(parts)
    if path.startswith('\\\\'):  # Check for UNC path
        path = '\\\\' + path  # Add double backslashes if it's a UNC path
    return path
```
