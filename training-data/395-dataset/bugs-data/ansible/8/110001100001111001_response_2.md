The bug in the `join_path` function is likely occurring when the input arguments are processed and transformed into the `parts` list. The `_unquote` method is being used to modify the `args`, and then the modified `args` are further processed and transformed. This double modification is likely causing the issue with the path.

The `_unquote` method is intended to remove any quotes from the input, but its implementation is not provided. It is important to ensure that the `_unquote` method is correctly implemented to remove any unnecessary characters and not interfere with the functionality of the `join_path` method.

To fix the bug in the `join_path` function, the `_unquote` method should be properly implemented to remove any unwanted characters from the input arguments. Additionally, the replacement of forward slashes with backslashes should be applied more selectively to avoid unintended modifications.

Here's the corrected code for the `join_path` function:

```python
def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        # Only apply unquoting for args that need it
        if '\\' in arg:
            arg = arg.replace('/', '\\')  # Replace forward slashes with backslashes
            parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\') if a])  # Split and add valid parts to the list
        else:
            parts.append(arg)  # Add as it is if no backslashes are present
        
    path = '\\'.join(parts)
    if path.startswith('~'):
        return path
    return path
```
