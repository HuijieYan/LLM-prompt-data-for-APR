Potential Error Location:
The issue may be with the `_unquote` method being called on the string values in the `args` tuple. 

Reasons for the Bug:
The `_unquote` method is meant to remove quotes from a string, but it may be incorrectly altering the directory strings causing the unexpected output.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the implementation of the `_unquote` method to ensure it is handling directory strings as expected without changing their structure.
2. Consider using a different approach to handle the directory strings without relying on the `_unquote` method.

Corrected Code:

```python
def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        # remove unnecessary escaping and replace '/' with '\'
        arg = arg.replace('\\\\', '').replace('/', '\\')
        parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\') if a])
    path = '\\'.join(parts)
    if path.startswith('~'):
        return path
    return path
```
