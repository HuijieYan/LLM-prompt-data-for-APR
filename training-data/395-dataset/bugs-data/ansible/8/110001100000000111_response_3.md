The bug is located in the `join_path` method of the `powershell.py` file. The bug occurs because the method does not properly handle UNC paths when joining file paths.

The issue arises due to the use of the `replace` method to replace forward slashes with backslashes and the subsequent splitting of the path based on backslashes. This approach does not handle UNC paths correctly, leading to the incorrect rendering of the path.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `join_path` method to properly handle UNC paths. This can be achieved by using the `os.path.join` method to join the path components, ensuring proper handling of UNC paths.

Here's the corrected code for the `join_path` method:

```python
import os

def join_path(self, *args):
    path = os.path.join(*args)
    if path.startswith('~'):
        return path
    return path
```

By using the `os.path.join` method, we ensure that UNC paths are handled correctly, and the path is rendered as expected when used with the `fetch` module.
