Potential Error:
The potential error in this code is the use of the `_unquote` method inside the `join_path` method without a reference to `self`. Since `_unquote` is a method of the class, it should be called using `self._unquote`.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurred because the `_unquote` method was called without referencing `self`, which is necessary for calling a method within the class.

Possible Approaches:
To fix the bug, we need to call the `_unquote` method using `self._unquote` to ensure that the method is being called from within the class.

Corrected Code:

```python
def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        arg = self._unquote(self, arg).replace('/', '\\')
        parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\') if a])
    path = '\\'.join(parts)
    if path.startswith('~'):
        return path
    return path
```
