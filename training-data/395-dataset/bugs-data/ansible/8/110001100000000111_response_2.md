The error is occurring when using the fetch module with a UNC path on a Windows managed node. The fetch module fails to render the path correctly and reports a "path not found" error. This is likely due to the join_path function in the powershell.py file not correctly handling UNC paths.

The potential error location within the join_path function is in the way it is handling UNC paths. It currently uses a basic string manipulation method to replace forward slashes with backslashes, which may not be sufficient for handling UNC paths.

To fix the bug, one approach is to modify the join_path function to properly handle UNC paths. This can be achieved by applying a more robust logic to handle the conversion of path separators and to ensure proper handling of UNC paths.

Below is the corrected code for the join_path function:

```python
# corrected join_path function
def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        arg = self._unquote(arg)
        if '\\' in arg:
            parts.extend(arg.split('\\'))
        else:
            parts.append(arg)
    path = '\\'.join(parts)
    if path.startswith('~'):
        return path
    return path
```

In the corrected code, we first unquote the argument. Then, we check if the path contains backslashes. If it does, we split the path and add the parts to the list. If not, we simply add the argument to the list. Finally, we join the parts using backslashes and return the path.
