The error is occurring in the `join_path` method of the `ShellModule` class. The issue seems to be with how the path is being processed and joined together using the `_unquote` method.

The error message from the test function indicates that the actual output does not match the expected output. Specifically, it seems that the path is not being handled correctly, resulting in an incorrect output.

The bug is likely occurring because the `_unquote` function is not working as intended, and it's not handling UNC paths properly. Additionally, the backslashes in the path are not being properly escaped, leading to incorrect path parsing.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_unquote` method handles UNC paths correctly and also properly escapes the backslashes in the path.

Here's the corrected code for the `join_path` method:

```python
def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        arg = arg.replace('/', '\\\\')  # escape the backslashes
        parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\\\') if a])  # handle UNC paths
    path = '\\\\'.join(parts)  # join the parts using double backslashes
    if path.startswith('\\\\'):
        return path
    return '\\\\' + path  # handle the edge case where the path does not start with double backslashes
```

With these changes, the `join_path` method should now handle UNC paths and properly escape the backslashes, resulting in the correct path output.
