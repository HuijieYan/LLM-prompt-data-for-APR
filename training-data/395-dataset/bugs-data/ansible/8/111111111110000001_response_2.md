The error occurs in the `join_path` function of the `ShellModule` class. The function is supposed to join the given path parts into a single path string. The error message indicates that the actual value returned by the function does not match the expected value.

The issue likely stems from the incorrect use of the `_unquote` method within the `join_path` function. The `_unquote` method is supposed to remove quotes from a given value, but it is being used in the context of joining path parts, which is not its intended purpose. This misuse of the `_unquote` method is leading to the unexpected behavior of the `join_path` function.

To fix the bug, the `join_path` function should not use the `_unquote` method. Instead, it should focus on properly joining the path parts and replacing forward slashes with backslashes.

Here's the corrected code for the `join_path` function:

```python
def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        arg = arg.replace('/', '\\')  # replacing forward slashes with backslashes
        parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\') if a])
    path = '\\'.join(parts)
    if path.startswith('~'):
        return path
    return path
```

By removing the unnecessary call to the `_unquote` method, the `join_path` function should now behave as intended and pass the test case.
