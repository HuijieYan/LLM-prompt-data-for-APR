Potential error location: 

The potential error in the `join_path` method is with the `_unquote` function, as it is not being called properly.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:

The `_unquote` function is not being called with the correct syntax. Additionally, it seems that the function `replace` is also not being used within the method.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Ensure that the `_unquote` function is being called correctly with the `self` parameter.
2. Check if the `replace` function is also needed within the `join_path` method and if so, use it appropriately.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        arg = self._unquote(self, arg).replace('/', '\\')  # call _unquote with self
        parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\') if a])
    path = '\\'.join(parts)
    if path.startswith('~'):
        return path
    return path
```
