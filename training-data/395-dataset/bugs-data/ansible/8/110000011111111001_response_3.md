The issue in the given buggy function is that it's incorrectly handling and joining the path parts, resulting in an incorrect output.

The buggy function is incorrectly joining the path parts using a backslash, replacing any forward slashes with backslashes and removing any empty parts. However, in the provided buggy case, the path parts are not being correctly split and joined.

The bug occurs because the buggy function incorrectly handles the UNC path parts, resulting in an incorrect path.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the path parts are processed and joined. Additionally, we should handle UNC paths correctly by splitting them on each backslash and joining them with a proper backslash.

Here's the corrected implementation of the function:

```python
def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        arg = self._unquote(arg)
        parts.extend(arg.split('\\') if '\\' in arg else arg.split('/'))
    path = os.path.join(*parts)
    if path.startswith('~'):
        return path
    return path
```

In the corrected code, each argument is first unquoted, and then split using the correct path separator. The `os.path.join()` method is then used to join the path parts correctly. This should produce the expected output for the given input.
