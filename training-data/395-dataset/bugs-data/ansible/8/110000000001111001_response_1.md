The bug in the provided function is that it incorrectly handles backslashes and forward slashes in the input path arguments. It also fails to remove the leading double backslashes "//" in the first path argument.

The potential error location is the line where the backslashes are being replaced with double backslashes: `arg = self._unquote(arg).replace('/', '\\')`

The reason behind the bug is that the function is using an incorrect method to replace the backslashes, which leads to the incorrect splitting of the path.

To fix the bug, the function should use the `os.path.join` method to correctly handle the joining of path components. It should also use the `os.path.normpath` method to normalize the path and remove any unnecessary double backslashes. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import os

def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        arg = self._unquote(arg).replace('/', '\\')
        parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\') if a])
    path = os.path.join(*parts)
    if path.startswith('~'):
        return path
    return os.path.normpath(path)
```
