The bug is likely occurring in the `join_path` function of the `powershell.py` file. The function is supposed to join the given paths and handle Windows UNC paths appropriately. It currently seems to mishandle the given paths, causing the generated path to be incorrect, as indicated by the error message from the test function.

The `_unquote` function for removing quotes from a string appears to be missing, and there is also an undeclared variable `a` in the list comprehension.

To fix the bug, the following changes could be made to the `join_path` function:
- Remove the call to `_unquote` and handle the paths directly instead. 
- Split the path using both '/' and '\\' characters.
- Remove empty strings from the split parts.
- Join the parts using '\\' to form the Windows path.

Here's the corrected `join_path` function:

```python
def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        arg = arg.replace('/', '\\').replace('\\\\', '\\')  # Handling both / and \\ for UNC paths
        parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\') if a])  # Splitting the path using both / and \\
    path = '\\'.join(parts)
    if path.startswith('~'):
        return path
    return path
```

With these changes, the `join_path` function should handle the given paths correctly, and the test case should pass without errors.
