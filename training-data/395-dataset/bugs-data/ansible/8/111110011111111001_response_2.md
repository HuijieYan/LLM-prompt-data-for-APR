The bug in the `join_path` function is due to how the backslashes are being replaced and joined. The function currently replaces all forward slashes with backslashes, and then joins the resulting paths with backslashes. However, the expected output is a UNC path, which should start with `\\` and then use backslashes as directory separators.

To fix this bug, the function should join the path parts by using double backslashes (`\\`) as the separator, and then add a backslash at the beginning to denote a UNC path.

Here's the corrected code for the `join_path` function:

```python
def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        arg = self._unquote(arg).replace('/', '\\').strip('\\')  # strip leading and trailing backslashes
        parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\') if a])
    path = '\\\\' + '\\'.join(parts)  # use double backslashes as the separator
    return path
```

With this correction, the `join_path` function should produce the expected UNC path for the input provided in the test case.
