This function is supposed to join the given path components together into a single path. However, it currently contains a bug where it replaces the forward slashes with backslashes and then joins the components together.

The buggy line is:
```python
arg = self._unquote(arg).replace('/', '\\')
```

This line replaces all forward slashes with backslashes, which is not the correct behavior especially for UNC paths. 

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to handle UNC paths correctly. We can use the `os.path.join` method to join the path components and handle UNC paths properly. Additionally, we should remove the `_unquote` method from the function as it is not necessary for joining paths.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import os

def join_path(self, *args):
    return os.path.join(*args)
```

This implementation utilizes the `os.path.join` method, which is a platform-independent way of joining paths. It will handle UNC paths and other types of paths correctly.
