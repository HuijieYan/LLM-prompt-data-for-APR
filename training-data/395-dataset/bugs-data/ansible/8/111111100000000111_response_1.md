The test case provided is for the Fetch module failing with a path not found error when used with a UNC path on a Windows managed node.

The potential error location within the problematic function `join_path` is the improper formatting of the UNC path.

The bug occurs because the `join_path` function is incorrect in its handling of UNC paths. The function attempts to replace forward slashes with backslashes, but it does not properly handle UNC paths which begin with two backslashes.

To fix the bug, the `join_path` function should be modified to correctly handle UNC paths by checking if the path starts with two backslashes and then formatting it accordingly.

```python
def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        arg = self._unquote(arg).replace('/', '\\')
        if arg.startswith('\\\\'):
            arg = '\\' + arg
        parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\') if a])
    path = '\\'.join(parts)
    if path.startswith('~'):
        return path
    return path
```
