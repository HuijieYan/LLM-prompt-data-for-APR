The error occurs in the `join_path` method, which is supposed to join the path parts provided as arguments. The buggy function is not correctly handling the UNC path format (starting with '\\'). This is evident from the test case where the expected UNC path is '\\\\host\\share\\dir1\\dir2\\dir3\\dir4\\dir5\\dir6' but the actual path returned is missing the first double backslash and is therefore not a valid UNC path.

The reason behind this bug is that the function is incorrectly handling the input arguments, especially those of UNC path format.

To fix the bug, the `join_path` function needs to properly handle the UNC path format and also handle the case where the path starts with '~'. It should correctly join the provided path parts and return a valid path string.

Here's the corrected code for the `join_path` method:

```python
def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        if arg.startswith('\\\\'):  # handling UNC path
            parts.append(arg.lstrip('\\'))
        else:
            arg = self._unquote(arg).replace('/', '\\')
            parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\') if a])
    path = '\\'.join(parts)
    if path.startswith('~'):
        return path
    return path
```
