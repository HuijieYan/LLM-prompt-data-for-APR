The error message "Path EC2AMAZ-T130RGR\\testshare\\test123.txt is not found" implies that the path is not being rendered correctly by the fetch module.

Looking at the function provided, the issue is likely with how the function is handling the UNC (Universal Naming Convention) path, which is a network path that starts with two backslashes.

The bug seems to be related to how the function is processing the backslashes in the UNC path. The function is replacing all forward slashes with backslashes, but it's not correctly handling the initial two backslashes of the UNC path.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the UNC path by preserving the initial two backslashes and properly joining the path components.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        arg = self._unquote(arg).replace('/', '\\')
        if arg.startswith('\\\\'):  # check if UNC path
            parts.append(arg)
        else:
            parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\') if a])
    path = '\\'.join(parts)
    if path.startswith('~'):
        return path
    return path
```

In the corrected code, we check if the argument starts with two backslashes, indicating a UNC path. If it does, we simply append it to the parts list. Otherwise, we split the path and add the individual parts to the list. This ensures that the UNC path is correctly handled and joined with other components.
