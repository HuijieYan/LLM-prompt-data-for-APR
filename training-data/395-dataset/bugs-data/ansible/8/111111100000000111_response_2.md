The issue is related to the 'fetch' module failing to fetch a file from a UNC path on a Windows server. The error message indicates that the path is not found, even though it is specified correctly in the 'win_copy' module.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the 'join_path' function. It is not handling UNC paths correctly, causing the 'fetch' module to fail.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the 'join_path' function is not properly handling UNC paths. The function is replacing forward slashes with backslashes but is not considering the UNC path format '\\server\share\file'.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the 'join_path' function to properly handle UNC paths.

Here's the corrected code for the 'join_path' function:

```python
def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        if arg.startswith('\\\\'):  # Check if the path is a UNC path
            parts.extend(arg.split('\\'))  # Split the UNC path by backslashes
        else:
            arg = self._unquote(arg).replace('/', '\\')  # Replace forward slashes with backslashes
            parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\') if a])
    path = '\\'.join(parts)
    if path.startswith('~'):
        return path
    return path
```
