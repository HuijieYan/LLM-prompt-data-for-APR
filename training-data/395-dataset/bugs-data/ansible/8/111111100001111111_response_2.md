Looking at the buggy code, the `join_path` function is incorrectly handling UNC paths provided in the `args` parameter. The function uses the `_unquote` method to unquote each argument and then replaces `/` with `\`. However, this implementation does not properly handle UNC paths.

The reason for the bug is that the current implementation does not account for UNC paths, which should start with `\\`. The current implementation also does not handle the path correctly when it starts with `~`.

To fix the bug, the `join_path` function should check if the argument starts with `\\` and handle it as a UNC path. It should also handle paths starting with `~` correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `join_path` function:

```python
def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        if arg.startswith('\\\\'):  # UNC path
            parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\') if a])
        else:
            arg = self._unquote(arg).replace('/', '\\')
            parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\') if a])
    
    path = '\\'.join(parts)
    if path.startswith('~'):
        # Handle paths starting with ~
        path = os.path.expanduser(path)
    return path
```

In this corrected code, we first check if the argument starts with `\\` to identify UNC paths. If it does, we split the path based on `\` and add the parts to the `parts` list.

If the argument does not start with `\\`, we continue with the existing implementation of unquoting and replacing `/` with `\`.

After constructing the `parts` list, we join the parts using `\` and then handle paths starting with `~` using `os.path.expanduser` to ensure proper handling of those paths.
