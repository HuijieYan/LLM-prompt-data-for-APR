The bug is causing the 'join_path' function to return an incorrect path. Instead of returning '\\\\host\\share\\dir1\\dir2\\dir3\\dir4\\dir5\\dir6', it returns 'host\\share\\dir1\\dir2\\dir3\\dir4\\dir5\\dir6'. This is due to the incorrect handling of the UNC path parts.

The bug is occurring because the 'join_path' function is incorrectly processing the UNC path parts. In the for loop, for each 'arg' in 'args', it applies the '_unquote' method and replaces '/' with '\\' before splitting the parts. However, this results in the incorrect path formation.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the 'join_path' function to correctly process the UNC path parts and construct the final path.

Here's the corrected 'join_path' function:

```python
def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        arg_parts = arg.split('\\')  # Split the parts using backslash
        parts.extend([a for a in arg_parts if a])  # Extend the parts list with non-empty parts
    path = '\\'.join(parts)  # Join the parts using backslash
    if path.startswith('\\\\'):  # Check if it's a UNC path prefix
        return '\\\\' + '\\'.join(parts[1:])  # Add the UNC path prefix and return the joined parts
    return path
```

This corrected function processes the UNC path parts correctly and constructs the final path with the correct UNC path prefix.
