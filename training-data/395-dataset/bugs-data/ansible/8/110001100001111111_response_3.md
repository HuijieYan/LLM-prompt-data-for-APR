The bug occurs in the `join_path` method of the `powershell.py` file. The `join_path` method is responsible for joining Windows paths by replacing forward slashes with backslashes and unquoting the paths.

The bug occurs because the path handling logic does not correctly handle UNC (Universal Naming Convention) paths, which are used to specify file paths in a network.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `join_path` method to correctly handle UNC paths.

Here's the corrected code for the `join_path` method:

```python
def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        # Unquote the path and normalize it
        arg = self._unquote(arg).replace('/', '\\')
        # Remove the leading backslashes from UNC paths
        if arg.startswith('\\\\'):
            arg = arg[2:]
        parts.extend(arg.split('\\'))
    # Join the parts into a single path
    path = '\\'.join(parts)
    return path
```

In this corrected code, we make sure to remove the leading backslashes from the UNC paths before splitting and joining the path parts. This will ensure that the UNC paths are handled correctly and the backslashes are properly normalized.

With this modification, the `join_path` method should now correctly handle UNC paths and produce the expected output.
