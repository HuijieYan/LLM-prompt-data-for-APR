1. The given code contains a function called `join_path` which is supposed to join the input path arguments and replace '/' with '\'. However, there are two issues in the function:
   - The `_unquote` function is called without the `self` parameter, which indicates it's a method of the class.
   - The `replace` method is not a part of the class and should be explicitly defined.

2. The potential error location is at the line `arg = self._unquote(arg).replace('/', '\\')` where the `_unquote` method is called without the `self` parameter.

3. The bug occurred because the `_unquote` method is a method of the class, and it's being called without the `self` parameter, hence the method is not being used correctly. Additionally, the `replace` method is not defined within the class.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_unquote` method is called correctly with the `self` parameter, and also define the `replace` method within the class.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `join_path` function:

```python
# corrected code
class ShellModule(ShellBase):
    # ... other methods ...

    def join_path(self, *args):
        def _unquote(value):
            # ... omitted code ...
            pass

        def replace(self, m):
            # ... omitted code ...
            pass
        
        parts = []
        for arg in args:
            arg = _unquote(self, arg).replace('/', '\\')
            parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\') if a])
        path = '\\'.join(parts)
        if path.startswith('~'):
            return path
        return path
```

In the corrected code:
- The `_unquote` and `replace` methods are defined within the `join_path` method, and `_unquote` method is called with the `self` parameter.
- The `replace` method is also defined within the class and called correctly.
