The test case `test_eos_eapi_vrf` sets the module arguments with `vrf='test'` and expects the output commands to be `['management api http-commands', 'no shutdown', 'vrf test', 'no shutdown']`. However, the actual output commands are `['management api http-commands', 'no shutdown', 'no shutdown', 'vrf test']`.

The buggy function `map_obj_to_commands` is responsible for generating the output commands based on the input updates. The issue seems to be related to the sequence of commands being generated, particularly when setting the VRF state.

The `add` function, responsible for inserting commands, should be designed to account for the specific order of command insertion based on certain conditions.

It is possible that the sequence of insertions in the `add` function might not be functioning as intended due to the conditions, resulting in the incorrect sequence of commands.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `add` function to handle command sequence based on specific conditions. Additionally, we need to ensure that the conditions for inserting commands are correctly evaluated.

Here is the corrected code for the `add` and `map_obj_to_commands` functions:

```python
def add(cmd, index=0):
    if cmd not in commands:
        commands.insert(index, cmd)

def map_obj_to_commands(updates, module, warnings):
    commands = []
    want, have = updates

    def needs_update(x):
        return want.get(x) is not None and (want.get(x) != have.get(x))

    if any((needs_update('http'), needs_update('http_port'))):
        if want['http'] is False:
            add('no protocol http')
        else:
            if have['http'] is False and want['http'] in (False, None):
                warnings.append('protocol http is not enabled, not configuring http port value')
            else:
                port = want['http_port'] or 80
                add('protocol http port %s' % port)

    if any((needs_update('https'), needs_update('https_port'))):
        if want['https'] is False:
            add('no protocol https')
        else:
            if have['https'] is False and want['https'] in (False, None):
                warnings.append('protocol https is not enabled, not configuring https port value')
            else:
                port = want['https_port'] or 443
                add('protocol https port %s' % port)

    if any((needs_update('local_http'), needs_update('local_http_port'))):
        if want['local_http'] is False:
            add('no protocol http localhost')
        else:
            if have['local_http'] is False and want['local_http'] in (False, None):
                warnings.append('protocol local_http is not enabled, not configuring local_http port value')
            else:
                port = want['local_http_port'] or 8080
                add('protocol http localhost port %s' % port, index=1)

    if any((needs_update('socket'), needs_update('socket'))):
        if want['socket'] is False:
            add('no protocol unix-socket')
        else:
            add('protocol unix-socket')

    if needs_update('state') and not needs_update('vrf'):
        if want['state'] == 'stopped':
            add('shutdown')
        elif want['state'] == 'started':
            add('no shutdown')

    if needs_update('vrf'):
        add('vrf %s' % want['vrf'], index=1)
        if want['state'] == 'stopped':
            add('shutdown')
        elif want['state'] == 'started':
            add('no shutdown')

    return commands
```

In the corrected code, the `add` function has an additional parameter `index` that allows for inserting the commands at specific positions. This will address the sequence issue in the output commands.
