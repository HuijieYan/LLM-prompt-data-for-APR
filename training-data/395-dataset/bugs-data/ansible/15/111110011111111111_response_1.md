The error seems to be related to the incorrect generation of commands in the `map_obj_to_commands` function. It appears that the issue is caused by the `add` function. The `add` function should be correctly inserting new commands at index 0 only if the 'management api http-commands' is not already present in the list of commands.

One possible approach to fixing this bug is to modify the `add` function to check if the command is already present in the list before adding it. If the command is already present, it should not be added again. Additionally, the `add` function should be defined outside the `map_obj_to_commands` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `map_obj_to_commands` function:

```python
def add(commands, cmd):
    if cmd not in commands:
        commands.append(cmd)

def map_obj_to_commands(updates, module, warnings):
    commands = list()
    want, have = updates

    def needs_update(x):
        return want.get(x) is not None and (want.get(x) != have.get(x))

    if any((needs_update('http'), needs_update('http_port'))):
        if want['http'] is False:
            add(commands, 'no protocol http')
        else:
            if have['http'] is False and want['http'] in (False, None):
                warnings.append('protocol http is not enabled, not configuring http port value')
            else:
                port = want['http_port'] or 80
                add(commands, 'protocol http port %s' % port)

    # ... (other if blocks)

    return commands
```
