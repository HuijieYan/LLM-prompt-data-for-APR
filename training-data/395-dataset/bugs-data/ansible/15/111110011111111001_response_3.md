The test case `test_eos_eapi_vrf` is asserting that the `commands` returned by the `start_unconfigured` function should be equal to the expected commands list. However, the assertion fails because the order of elements in the `commands` list is different, even though the elements themselves are the same.

Upon analyzing the provided `map_obj_to_commands` function, it seems that the bug might be related to the `add` function. The `add` function always adds the provided command at the end of the `commands` list, but the order of commands is important in this scenario.

The reason for the bug is that the `add` function continually appends new commands to the end of the `commands` list, leading to a different order of commands than expected.

To fix the bug, the `add` function should prioritize the order of commands based on their type. Specifically, the `if` conditions should be updated to add commands at specified positions based on their type.

Here is the corrected code for the `map_obj_to_commands` function:

```python
def map_obj_to_commands(updates, module, warnings):
    commands = list()
    want, have = updates

    def needs_update(x):
        return want.get(x) is not None and (want.get(x) != have.get(x))

    def add(cmd):
        insert_at_start = ['management api http-commands', 'vrf', 'shutdown', 'no shutdown']
        if cmd in insert_at_start:
            commands.insert(0, cmd)
        else:
            commands.append(cmd)

    if any((needs_update('http'), needs_update('http_port'))):
        if want['http'] is False:
            add('no protocol http')
        else:
            if have['http'] is False and want['http'] in (False, None):
                warnings.append('protocol http is not enabled, not configuring http port value')
            else:
                port = want['http_port'] or 80
                add('protocol http port %s' % port)

    if any((needs_update('https'), needs_update('https_port'))):
        if want['https'] is False:
            add('no protocol https')
        else:
            if have['https'] is False and want['https'] in (False, None):
                warnings.append('protocol https is not enabled, not configuring https port value')
            else:
                port = want['https_port'] or 443
                add('protocol https port %s' % port)

    if any((needs_update('local_http'), needs_update('local_http_port'))):
        if want['local_http'] is False:
            add('no protocol http localhost')
        else:
            if have['local_http'] is False and want['local_http'] in (False, None):
                warnings.append('protocol local_http is not enabled, not configuring local_http port value')
            else:
                port = want['local_http_port'] or 8080
                add('protocol http localhost port %s' % port)

    if any((needs_update('socket'))):
        if want['socket'] is False:
            add('no protocol unix-socket')
        else:
            add('protocol unix-socket')

    if needs_update('state') and not needs_update('vrf'):
        if want['state'] == 'stopped':
            add('shutdown')
        elif want['state'] == 'started':
            add('no shutdown')

    if needs_update('vrf'):
        add('vrf %s' % want['vrf'])
        # switching operational vrfs here
        # need to add the desired state as well
        if want['state'] == 'stopped':
            add('shutdown')
        elif want['state'] == 'started':
            add('no shutdown')

    return commands
```

In the corrected code, the `add` function has been modified to check for specific commands that need to be inserted at the start of the `commands` list. If the command matches any of the statements in `insert_at_start`, it is added to the start of the list. Otherwise, it is appended as earlier. This change ensures that the order of commands matches the expected order, resolving the bug.
