The error occurs because the 'vrf' command is not being added to the 'commands' list in the correct order. The test case is comparing the 'commands' list and expects a specific order which is not being met due to the 'vrf' command being added after 'no shutdown' in the actual results.

The issue is caused by the 'add' function which inserts 'management api http-commands' at the 0 index each time it is called, resulting in it being added multiple times and creating the inconsistency in the order of the commands.

To fix the bug, the 'management api http-commands' should only be appended to the 'commands' list if it is not already present. The 'add' function should also include the VRF command at the correct index.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def map_obj_to_commands(updates, module, warnings):
    commands = list()
    want, have = updates

    def needs_update(x):
        return want.get(x) is not None and (want.get(x) != have.get(x))

    def add(cmd):
        if cmd not in commands:
            commands.append(cmd)

    if any((needs_update('http'), needs_update('http_port'))):
        if want['http'] is False:
            add('no protocol http')
        else:
            if have['http'] is False and want['http'] in (False, None):
                warnings.append('protocol http is not enabled, not configuring http port value')
            else:
                port = want['http_port'] or 80
                add('protocol http port %s' % port)

    if any((needs_update('https'), needs_update('https_port'))):
        if want['https'] is False:
            add('no protocol https')
        else:
            if have['https'] is False and want['https'] in (False, None):
                warnings.append('protocol https is not enabled, not configuring https port value')
            else:
                port = want['https_port'] or 443
                add('protocol https port %s' % port)

    if any((needs_update('local_http'), needs_update('local_http_port'))):
        if want['local_http'] is False:
            add('no protocol http localhost')
        else:
            if have['local_http'] is False and want['local_http'] in (False, None):
                warnings.append('protocol local_http is not enabled, not configuring local_http port value')
            else:
                port = want['local_http_port'] or 8080
                add('protocol http localhost port %s' % port)

    if any((needs_update('socket'), needs_update('socket'))):
        if want['socket'] is False:
            add('no protocol unix-socket')
        else:
            add('protocol unix-socket')

    if needs_update('state') and not needs_update('vrf'):
        if want['state'] == 'stopped':
            add('shutdown')
        elif want['state'] == 'started':
            add('no shutdown')

    if needs_update('vrf'):
        add('vrf %s' % want['vrf'])
        # switching operational vrfs here
        # need to add the desired state as well
        if want['state'] == 'stopped':
            add('shutdown')
        elif want['state'] == 'started':
            add('no shutdown')

    if 'management api http-commands' not in commands:
        commands.insert(0, 'management api http-commands')

    return commands
```
