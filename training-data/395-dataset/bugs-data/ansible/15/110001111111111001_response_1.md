The error occurs in the `map_obj_to_commands` function, specifically in the way the commands are being appended to the `commands` list. The `add` function does not check for the existence of the command before appending it, leading to duplicate entries when the same command is added again.

The approach to fix the bug is to modify the `add` function to check if the command already exists in the `commands` list before appending it. This can be done by using a set to keep track of commands that have already been added.

Below is the corrected code for the `map_obj_to_commands` function:

```python
def map_obj_to_commands(updates, module, warnings):
    commands = []
    want, have = updates

    existing_commands = set()

    def needs_update(x):
        return want.get(x) is not None and (want.get(x) != have.get(x))

    def add(cmd):
        if cmd not in existing_commands:
            existing_commands.add(cmd)
            commands.append(cmd)

    # rest of the code remains the same
    # ...

    return commands
```

By using the `existing_commands` set to keep track of the commands that have already been added, the duplicate commands issue should be resolved. This will ensure that only unique commands are added to the `commands` list.
