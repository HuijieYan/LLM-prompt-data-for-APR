Based on the given code and the runtime values, it seems that the issue lies in the `add` function. This is because the condition `if 'management api http-commands' not in commands` should check whether the specific command is already in the list of commands, rather than just checking for the entire string `management api http-commands`. Additionally, there are inconsistencies in handling the `wants` and `have` dictionaries, and the logic for updating the `commands` list is not clear.

The issue occurs when the function tries to add the 'management api http-commands' string to the `commands` list. It should only add this string if it doesn't already exist in the list, and it should be added at the beginning of the list. Furthermore, the conditions for handling the `wants` and `have` dictionaries are not consistent.

To fix this issue, you can update the `add` function to include the logic for checking whether a command already exists in the `commands` list. Additionally, review and update the logic for handling the `wants` and `have` dictionaries to ensure consistency.

Here's the corrected code for the `add` function and the main `map_obj_to_commands` function:

```python
def add(cmd, commands):
    if cmd not in commands:
        commands.insert(0, cmd)

def map_obj_to_commands(updates, module, warnings):
    commands = list()
    want, have = updates

    def needs_update(x):
        return want.get(x) is not None and (want.get(x) != have.get(x))

    def add(cmd):
        if cmd not in commands:
            commands.insert(0, cmd)

    if any((needs_update('http'), needs_update('http_port'))):
        if want['http'] is False:
            add('no protocol http')
        else:
            if have['http'] is False and want['http'] in (False, None):
                warnings.append('protocol http is not enabled, not configuring http port value')
            else:
                port = want['http_port'] or 80
                add('protocol http port %s' % port)

    if any((needs_update('https'), needs_update('https_port'))):
        if want['https'] is False:
            add('no protocol https')
        else:
            if have['https'] is False and want['https'] in (False, None):
                warnings.append('protocol https is not enabled, not configuring https port value')
            else:
                port = want['https_port'] or 443
                add('protocol https port %s' % port)

    if any((needs_update('local_http'), needs_update('local_http_port'))):
        if want['local_http'] is False:
            add('no protocol http localhost')
        else:
            if have['local_http'] is False and want['local_http'] in (False, None):
                warnings.append('protocol local_http is not enabled, not configuring local_http port value')
            else:
                port = want['local_http_port'] or 8080
                add('protocol http localhost port %s' % port)

    if any((needs_update('socket'), needs_update('socket'))):
        if want['socket'] is False:
            add('no protocol unix-socket')
        else:
            add('protocol unix-socket')

    if needs_update('state') and not needs_update('vrf'):
        if want['state'] == 'stopped':
            add('shutdown')
        elif want['state'] == 'started':
            add('no shutdown')

    if needs_update('vrf'):
        add('vrf %s' % want['vrf'])
        # switching operational vrfs here
        # need to add the desired state as well
        if want['state'] == 'stopped':
            add('shutdown')
        elif want['state'] == 'started':
            add('no shutdown')

    return commands
```
