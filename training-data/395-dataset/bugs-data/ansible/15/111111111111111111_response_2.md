The bug occurs in the `map_obj_to_commands` function, where the `add` function is adding duplicate commands to the `commands` list without checking for their presence. This results in additional elements being added to the `commands` list, which causes the test case to fail due to a mismatch.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `add` function so that it checks for the presence of the command before adding it to the list.

The corrected `map_obj_to_commands` function is as follows:

```python
def map_obj_to_commands(updates, module, warnings):
    commands = list()
    want, have = updates

    def needs_update(x):
        return want.get(x) is not None and (want.get(x) != have.get(x))

    # Modified add function to check for the presence of the command
    def add(cmd):
        if cmd not in commands:
            commands.append(cmd)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    if any((needs_update('http'), needs_update('http_port'))):
        if want['http'] is False:
            add('no protocol http')
        else:
            if have['http'] is False and want['http'] in (False, None):
                warnings.append('protocol http is not enabled, not configuring http port value')
            else:
                port = want['http_port'] or 80
                add('protocol http port %s' % port)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged

    return commands
```

With the above modification, the `add` function will now only add unique commands to the `commands` list, preventing the duplication issue and resolving the test case failure.
