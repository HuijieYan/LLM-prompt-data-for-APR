The test case "test_eos_eapi_vrf" is failing due to a mismatch in the expected and actual commands. The test was expecting the "commands" list to be in a specific order, but the actual command list did not match the expected order, resulting in an AssertionError.

The potential error is likely in the "map_obj_to_commands" function, where the order of commands is not being maintained correctly, leading to different ordering in the actual and expected results.

The root cause of the bug is the insertion of the "commands" list multiple times within the "add" method, which is causing the order of commands to change.

To fix the bug, one approach is to maintain a separate list for each type of command and then merge them together at the end to ensure the correct order.

Here's the corrected code for the "map_obj_to_commands" function:

```python
def map_obj_to_commands(updates, module, warnings):
    commands = []

    want, have = updates
    
    command_list_http = []
    command_list_https = []
    command_list_local_http = []

    if want.get('http') != have.get('http') or want.get('http_port') != have.get('http_port'):
        if want['http'] is False:
            command_list_http.append('no protocol http')
        else:
            if have['http'] is False and want['http'] in (False, None):
                warnings.append('protocol http is not enabled, not configuring http port value')
            else:
                port = want['http_port'] or 80
                command_list_http.append('protocol http port %s' % port)
    
    if want.get('https') != have.get('https') or want.get('https_port') != have.get('https_port'):
        if want['https'] is False:
            command_list_https.append('no protocol https')
        else:
            if have['https'] is False and want['https'] in (False, None):
                warnings.append('protocol https is not enabled, not configuring https port value')
            else:
                port = want['https_port'] or 443
                command_list_https.append('protocol https port %s' % port)
    
    if want.get('local_http') != have.get('local_http') or want.get('local_http_port') != have.get('local_http_port'):
        if want['local_http'] is False:
            command_list_local_http.append('no protocol http localhost')
        else:
            if have['local_http'] is False and want['local_http'] in (False, None):
                warnings.append('protocol local_http is not enabled, not configuring local_http port value')
            else:
                port = want['local_http_port'] or 8080
                command_list_local_http.append('protocol http localhost port %s' % port)
    
    # Combine all command lists
    commands += ['management api http-commands']
    commands += command_list_http
    commands += command_list_https
    commands += command_list_local_http
    if want.get('socket') != have.get('socket'):
        if want['socket'] is False:
            commands.append('no protocol unix-socket')
        else:
            commands.append('protocol unix-socket')
    
    if want.get('state') != have.get('state') and want.get('vrf') != have.get('vrf'):
        if want['state'] == 'stopped':
            commands.append('shutdown')
        elif want['state'] == 'started':
            commands.append('no shutdown')
        commands.append('vrf %s' % want.get('vrf'))
        # switching operational vrfs here
        # need to add the desired state as well
        if want['state'] == 'stopped':
            commands.append('shutdown')
        elif want['state'] == 'started':
            commands.append('no shutdown')

    return commands
```
