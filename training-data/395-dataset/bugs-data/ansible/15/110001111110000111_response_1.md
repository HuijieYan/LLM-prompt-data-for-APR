The error message indicates that there is an issue with the 'commands' list not matching the expected result. This discrepancy is caused by a missing 'management api http-commands' command in the list. Therefore, the potential error location within the problematic function is the 'add' function, where the 'management api http-commands' command should be added to the list of commands.

The bug occurs because the 'management api http-commands' is not being added to the 'commands' list within the 'add' function. This leads to the discrepancy between the expected and actual command lists.

To fix this bug, the 'add' function needs to be modified to ensure that 'management api http-commands' is added to the commands list before any other commands are added. Additionally, this function should only add the 'management api http-commands' command once to avoid duplicates.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def map_obj_to_commands(updates, module, warnings):
    commands = list()
    want, have = updates

    unique_commands_set = set()

    def needs_update(x):
        return want.get(x) is not None and (want.get(x) != have.get(x))

    def add(cmd):
        unique_commands_set.add(cmd)

    if any((needs_update('http'), needs_update('http_port'))):
        if want['http'] is not False:
            port = want['http_port'] or 80
            add('protocol http port %s' % port)

    if any((needs_update('https'), needs_update('https_port'))):
        if want['https'] is not False:
            port = want['https_port'] or 443
            add('protocol https port %s' % port)

    if any((needs_update('local_http'), needs_update('local_http_port'))):
        if want['local_http'] is not False:
            port = want['local_http_port'] or 8080
            add('protocol http localhost port %s' % port)

    if any((needs_update('socket'), needs_update('socket'))):
        if want['socket'] is not False:
            add('protocol unix-socket')

    if needs_update('state') and not needs_update('vrf'):
        if want['state'] == 'stopped':
            add('shutdown')
        elif want['state'] == 'started':
            add('no shutdown')

    if needs_update('vrf'):
        add('vrf %s' % want['vrf'])
        if want['state'] == 'stopped':
            add('shutdown')
        elif want['state'] == 'started':
            add('no shutdown')

    commands.append('management api http-commands')  # Adding 'management api http-commands' to the commands list
    commands += sorted(unique_commands_set)  # Add the unique commands to the list

    return commands
```

In the corrected code, a set 'unique_commands_set' is introduced to store unique commands before adding them to the 'commands' list at the end. This ensures that 'management api http-commands' is added first and no duplicates are added.
