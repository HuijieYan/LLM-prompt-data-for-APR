The error message indicates that the test is failing due to a mismatch in the expected and actual commands returned by the `map_obj_to_commands` function. Specifically, the `commands` list is not being generated correctly, leading to a mismatch in the order of commands.

The potential error location within the `map_obj_to_commands` function could be the `add` function, which inserts 'management api http-commands' into the commands list without checking if it already exists and also appends the commands to the list, potentially causing a duplicate entry.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `add` function is not handling the 'management api http-commands' correctly, and the logic for adding other commands also needs to be reviewed.

Approach for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that 'management api http-commands' is only added once to the commands list and does not create duplicate entries.
2. Review the logic for adding other commands to ensure that they are added in the correct order without creating duplicates.

Here's the corrected code for the `map_obj_to_commands` function:

```python
def map_obj_to_commands(updates, module, warnings):
    commands = []

    # Helper function to add a command to the list, checking for duplicates
    def add(cmd):
        if cmd not in commands:
            commands.append(cmd)

    want, have = updates

    if want.get('http') is False or want.get('http_port') is False:
        add('no protocol http')
    elif want.get('http') and want.get('http_port'):
        if have.get('http') is False and want.get('http') in (False, None):
            warnings.append('protocol http is not enabled, not configuring http port value')
        else:
            port = want.get('http_port') or 80
            add('protocol http port %s' % port)

    if want.get('https') is False or want.get('https_port') is False:
        add('no protocol https')
    elif want.get('https') and want.get('https_port'):
        if have.get('https') is False and want.get('https') in (False, None):
            warnings.append('protocol https is not enabled, not configuring https port value')
        else:
            port = want.get('https_port') or 443
            add('protocol https port %s' % port)

    if want.get('local_http') is False or want.get('local_http_port') is False:
        add('no protocol http localhost')
    elif want.get('local_http') and want.get('local_http_port'):
        if have.get('local_http') is False and want.get('local_http') in (False, None):
            warnings.append('protocol local_http is not enabled, not configuring local_http port value')
        else:
            port = want.get('local_http_port') or 8080
            add('protocol http localhost port %s' % port)

    if want.get('socket') is False:
        add('no protocol unix-socket')
    else:
        add('protocol unix-socket')

    if updates.get('state') and not updates.get('vrf'):
        if want.get('state') == 'stopped':
            add('shutdown')
        elif want.get('state') == 'started':
            add('no shutdown')

    if updates.get('vrf'):
        add('vrf %s' % want.get('vrf'))
        # switching operational vrfs here
        # need to add the desired state as well
        if want.get('state') == 'stopped':
            add('shutdown')
        elif want.get('state') == 'started':
            add('no shutdown')

    if 'management api http-commands' not in commands:
        commands.insert(0, 'management api http-commands')

    return commands
```

This corrected code addresses the issues with handling 'management api http-commands' and updating the commands list without creating duplicates.
