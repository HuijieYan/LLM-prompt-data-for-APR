The issue is that the 'management api http-commands' is not being turned on by default. This is because the 'no shutdown' command for the 'http' and 'https' configurations is missing.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the 'map_obj_to_commands' function, where the conditions for adding the 'no shutdown' command for 'http' and 'https' configurations are not correctly handled.

The bug occurs because the 'no shutdown' command for 'http' and 'https' configurations is not added by default, leading to the 'management api http-commands' not being turned on.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to add the 'no shutdown' command for 'http' and 'https' configurations when they are not explicitly set to False.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def map_obj_to_commands(updates, module, warnings):
    commands = list()
    want, have = updates

    def add(cmd):
        if 'management api http-commands' not in commands:
            commands.insert(0, 'management api http-commands')
        commands.append(cmd)

    if want['http'] is not False or want['http'] is not None:
        add('no shutdown')
    
    if want['https'] is not False or want['https'] is not None:
        add('no shutdown')
    
    if any((needs_update('http'), needs_update('http_port'))):
        if want['http'] is False:
            add('no protocol http')
        else:
            if have['http'] is False and want['http'] in (False, None):
                warnings.append('protocol http is not enabled, not configuring http port value')
            else:
                port = want['http_port'] or 80
                add('protocol http port %s' % port)

    if any((needs_update('https'), needs_update('https_port'))):
        if want['https'] is False:
            add('no protocol https')
        else:
            if have['https'] is False and want['https'] in (False, None):
                warnings.append('protocol https is not enabled, not configuring https port value')
            else:
                port = want['https_port'] or 443
                add('protocol https port %s' % port)

    # Rest of the code remains the same
```
In the corrected code, the 'no shutdown' commands for 'http' and 'https' configurations are added when they are not explicitly set to False or None, ensuring that the 'management api http-commands' is turned on by default.
