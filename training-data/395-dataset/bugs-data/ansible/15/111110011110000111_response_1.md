The error occurs in the function `map_obj_to_commands` as it is not properly handling the addition of the `no shutdown` command for http, https, and local_http when they are set to `True`. This resulted in the incorrect listing of commands in the test function.

The issues occurring in the function are:
1. Missing "no shutdown" command for http, https, and local_http when set to `True`.
2. Incorrect placement of the "vrf" command.

To fix the bug, the `map_obj_to_commands` function should be modified to include the "no shutdown" command for http, https, and local_http when they are set to `True`. Additionally, the "vrf" command should be added in the correct position.
Here is the corrected function:

```python
def map_obj_to_commands(updates, module, warnings):
    commands = list()

        return want.get(x) is not None and (want.get(x) != have.get(x))

    def add(cmd):
        if 'management api http-commands' not in commands:
            commands.insert(0, 'management api http-commands')
        commands.append(cmd)

            if have['http'] is False and want['http'] in (True, None):  # Changed from False to True
                add('no shutdown')  # Added "no shutdown" command
                if want['http_port'] is not None:  # Added condition
                    port = want['http_port']
                else:

                if want['local_http_port'] is not None:  # Added condition
                    port = want['local_http_port']
                else:
                    port = 8080
                add('protocol http localhost port %s' % port)

    if needs_update('socket'):
        if want['socket'] is False:
            add('no protocol unix-socket')
        else:
            add('protocol unix-socket')

    if needs_update('state') and not needs_update('vrf'):

            add('shutdown')
        elif want['state'] == 'started':
            add('no shutdown')

    if needs_update('vrf'):  # Moved the VRF command here
        add('vrf %s' % want['vrf'])
        if want['state'] == 'stopped':  # Repeated commands removed
            add('shutdown')
        elif want['state'] == 'started':
            add('no shutdown')

    return commands
