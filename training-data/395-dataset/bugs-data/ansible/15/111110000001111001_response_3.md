The bug in the code seems to be related to the `needs_update` function, which is a local function within the `map_obj_to_commands` function. The `needs_update` function is used to check if an update is needed for a specific key in the `want` and `have` dictionaries. 

The issue lies in the condition `want.get(x) != have.get(x)` within the `needs_update` function. This condition only checks if the values of `want` and `have` are equal. However, the intent seems to be to check if the keys exist in both dictionaries and if their values are different.

To fix this bug, the conditions within the `needs_update` function should be modified to correctly check if the keys exist and have different values.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def map_obj_to_commands(updates, module, warnings):
    commands = list()
    want, have = updates

    def needs_update(x):
        return x in want and x in have and want[x] != have[x]

    def add(cmd):
        if 'management api http-commands' not in commands:
            commands.insert(0, 'management api http-commands')
        commands.append(cmd)

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...

    return commands
```

The updated `needs_update` function now correctly checks if the key `x` exists in both `want` and `have` dictionaries, and then compares their values to determine if an update is needed.
