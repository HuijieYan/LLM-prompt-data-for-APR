The test case `test_eos_eapi_vrf` is attempting to verify the behavior of the `map_obj_to_commands` function by comparing the expected `commands` list with the actual `commands` list returned by the function. However, the function is not returning the expected commands, leading to an assertion error in the test case.

The issue with the `map_obj_to_commands` function lies in the conditional logic for constructing the `commands` list. It is not correctly handling the logic for adding or removing certain commands based on the provided input updates.

The main reason for the occurrence of the bug is due to incorrect conditional checks inside the function for adding or removing commands based on the `updates` input.

To fix the bug, we need to review the conditional statements inside the `map_obj_to_commands` function and ensure that the commands are added or removed accurately based on the provided updates.

Here's the corrected code for the `map_obj_to_commands` function:

```python
def map_obj_to_commands(updates, module, warnings):
    commands = list()
    want, have = updates

    def add_command(command):
        if command not in commands:
            commands.append(command)

    if want['http'] != have['http'] or want['http_port'] != have['http_port']:
        if want['http'] is False:
            add_command('no protocol http')
        else:
            port = want['http_port'] or 80
            add_command('protocol http port %s' % port)

    if want['https'] != have['https'] or want['https_port'] != have['https_port']:
        if want['https'] is False:
            add_command('no protocol https')
        else:
            port = want['https_port'] or 443
            add_command('protocol https port %s' % port)

    if want['local_http'] != have['local_http'] or want['local_http_port'] != have['local_http_port']:
        if want['local_http'] is False:
            add_command('no protocol http localhost')
        else:
            port = want['local_http_port'] or 8080
            add_command('protocol http localhost port %s' % port)

    if want['socket'] != have['socket']:
        if want['socket'] is False:
            add_command('no protocol unix-socket')
        else:
            add_command('protocol unix-socket')

    if want['state'] != have['state'] and want['state'] == 'stopped':
        add_command('shutdown')
    elif want['state'] != have['state'] and want['state'] == 'started':
        add_command('no shutdown')

    if want['vrf'] != have['vrf']:
        add_command('vrf %s' % want['vrf'])
        if want['state'] == 'stopped':
            add_command('shutdown')
        elif want['state'] == 'started':
            add_command('no shutdown')

    return commands
```

In the corrected code, we have replaced the inner functions `needs_update` and `add` with a cleaner approach to directly add commands to the `commands` list based on the desired logic. This should fix the bug and produce the expected list of commands for the given `updates`.
