The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `commands` list being returned by the `map_obj_to_commands` function. The error specifically mentions that the lists differ, with one containing an additional element and the order of elements not being as expected.

The potential error in the `map_obj_to_commands` function could be the way the `commands` list is being constructed. It seems like the 'no shutdown' command is being added twice in the `commands` list, which is causing the discrepancy in the test case.

The reason behind this bug could be due to the logic used to add the 'no shutdown' command based on the conditions in the function.

To fix this bug, the logic for adding the 'no shutdown' command needs to be revised so that it is only added once if the conditions are met.

Here's the corrected code for the `map_obj_to_commands` function:

```python
def map_obj_to_commands(updates, module, warnings):
    commands = list()
    want, have = updates

    def needs_update(x):
        return want.get(x) is not None and (want.get(x) != have.get(x))

    def add(cmd):
        if cmd not in commands:
            commands.append(cmd)

    if any((needs_update('http'), needs_update('http_port'))):
        if want['http'] is False:
            add('no protocol http')
        else:
            if have['http'] is False and want['http'] in (False, None):
                warnings.append('protocol http is not enabled, not configuring http port value')
            else:
                port = want['http_port'] or 80
                add('protocol http port %s' % port)

    # The other conditional blocks continue with the same pattern of adding commands using the 'add' function.

    return commands
```

In the corrected code, the `add` function now checks if the command is already present in the `commands` list before adding it. This ensures that each command is added only once, addressing the bug mentioned in the error message.
