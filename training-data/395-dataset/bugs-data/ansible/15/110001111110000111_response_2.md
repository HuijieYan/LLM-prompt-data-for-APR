The error in the provided code is due to the 'commands' list not being updated correctly within the 'map_obj_to_commands' function. The 'commands' list does not contain the correct order of commands as expected by the test case.

The potential error location within the 'map_obj_to_commands' function is the 'add' method, which should be responsible for appending commands to the 'commands' list.

The bug occurs because the 'add' function incorrectly checks for the presence of 'management api http-commands' in the 'commands' list. It uses the 'in' keyword, which checks for the presence of a specific string in the list, rather than checking for the presence of the command. This causes the 'management api http-commands' to be added to the 'commands' list multiple times.

To fix the bug, the 'add' function should check if the command is not already in the 'commands' list before adding it.

Here's the corrected code for the 'map_obj_to_commands' function:

```python
def map_obj_to_commands(updates, module, warnings):
    commands = list()
    want, have = updates

    def needs_update(x):
        return want.get(x) is not None and (want.get(x) != have.get(x))

    def add(cmd):
        if cmd not in commands:
            commands.append(cmd)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

With this correction, the 'add' function correctly checks if the command already exists in the 'commands' list before adding it, ensuring that duplicate commands are not added. This should resolve the issue reported in the test case.
