The potential error location within the problematic function is in the add(cmd) function. The function is attempting to check if 'management api http-commands' is not in the commands list, however, 'management api http-commands' is not a string, it seems to be an object or a dictionary that represents the configuration for API commands. 

The bug occurs because the function is checking a string value against a list, instead of checking if a particular command object exists in the list. This is likely the cause of the error message and the incorrect behavior of the function.

To fix the bug, the add(cmd) function should be modified to check if the specific command object is already in the commands list, and if not, add the command to the list.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/ansible_15/lib/ansible/modules/network/eos/eos_eapi.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def needs_update(x):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def add(cmd):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass


# this is the corrected function
def map_obj_to_commands(updates, module, warnings):
    commands = list()
    want, have = updates

    def needs_update(x):
        return want.get(x) is not None and (want.get(x) != have.get(x))

    def add(cmd):
        if cmd not in commands:  # check if the command is not already in the list
            commands.append(cmd)

    if any((needs_update('http'), needs_update('http_port'))):
        if want['http'] is False:
            add('no protocol http')
        else:
            if have['http'] is False and want['http'] in (False, None):
                warnings.append('protocol http is not enabled, not configuring http port value')
            else:
                port = want['http_port'] or 80
                add('protocol http port %s' % port)

    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    return commands
```
