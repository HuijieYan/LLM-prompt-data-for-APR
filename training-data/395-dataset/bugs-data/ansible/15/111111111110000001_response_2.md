The error message indicates that there is an issue with the order of commands in the `commands` list being constructed by the `map_obj_to_commands` function. Specifically, the order of 'vrf test' and 'no shutdown' is incorrect, causing the test to fail.

The potential error location within the `map_obj_to_commands` function is the order in which the commands are added to the `commands` list. It seems that the `add` function is adding commands in the wrong order or some commands are being duplicated.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely related to the conditional checks within the `map_obj_to_commands` function. The logic for adding the commands in the correct order might be incorrect, leading to the issue observed in the test case.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Update the `add` function to handle the addition of commands in the correct order, ensuring that duplicate commands are not added.
- Review the conditional checks within the `map_obj_to_commands` function to ensure the correct commands are being added based on the conditions.

The corrected code for the `map_obj_to_commands` function:

```python
def map_obj_to_commands(updates, module, warnings):
    commands = list()
    want, have = updates

    def add(cmd):
        if cmd not in commands:  # Check if command already exists in the list
            commands.append(cmd)

    if any((needs_update('http'), needs_update('http_port'))):
        if want['http'] is False:
            add('no protocol http')
        else:
            if have['http'] is False and want['http'] in (False, None):
                warnings.append('protocol http is not enabled, not configuring http port value')
            else:
                port = want['http_port'] or 80
                add('protocol http port %s' % port)

    # Other condition checks and command additions...

    if needs_update('vrf'):
        add('vrf %s' % want['vrf'])
        # Add the desired state as well
        if want['state'] == 'stopped':
            add('shutdown')
        elif want['state'] == 'started':
            add('no shutdown')

    return commands
```

In the corrected code, the `add` function checks if the command being added already exists in the `commands` list to avoid duplicates. The conditional checks and command additions are reviewed to ensure the correct order of commands in the `commands` list.
