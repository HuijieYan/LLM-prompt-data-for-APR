The issue seems to be related to the handling of the "to_remove" dictionary in the generate_commands function. The bug occurs because the conditional check for "vlan_id" in the "to_remove" dictionary is incorrect, which leads to the "vlan_id" incorrectly being removed from the commands list.

The buggy code checks for "vlan_id" in the "to_remove" dictionary, but it should be checking for "vlan_id" as the key in the "to_remove" list. This is why the "vlan_id" is not being correctly removed from the commands list.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the conditional check for "vlan_id" in the "to_remove" list. Additionally, we should iterate through the "to_remove" list instead of using a dictionary to remove the corresponding keys.

Here's the corrected code for the generate_commands function:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []

    if "vlan_id" in to_remove:
        commands.append("no vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if key == "vlan_id" or value is None:
            continue

        commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    for key in to_remove:
        commands.append("no {0}".format(key))

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly handle the "to_remove" list and the "vlan_id" key, and produce the expected output for the given test case.
