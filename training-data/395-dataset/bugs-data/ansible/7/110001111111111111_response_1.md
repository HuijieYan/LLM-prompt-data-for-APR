The issue is caused by the 'no' keyword being added to the commands list when in fact it should be added as 'no name' to remove the 'name' attribute for the VLAN. This behavior is causing the assertion error in the test case.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the 'for' loop that adds the 'no' statements to the commands list. Here's the corrected code for the 'generate_commands' function:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []
    if "vlan_id" in to_remove:
        return ["no vlan {0}".format(vlan_id)]

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if key == "vlan_id" or value is None:
            continue

        commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    for key, value in to_remove.items():
        commands.append("no {0} {1}".format(key, value))

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```

By making this change, the commands list will be populated with the correct 'no' statements to remove the specified attributes for the VLAN. This should resolve the issue and the test case should pass without any assertion errors.
