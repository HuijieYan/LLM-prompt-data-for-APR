The bug occurs in the `generate_commands` function. It fails to properly handle the `to_remove` dictionary when generating the commands. 

The bug is caused by the logic that checks for "vlan_id" in `to_remove`, which is incorrect. The check should be for "name". Additionally, the code appends "no {key}" for each key in `to_remove`, which is not necessary.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Change the logic to check for "name" in `to_remove` instead of "vlan_id".
2. Instead of simply appending "no {key}" for each key in `to_remove`, we should only append "no {key}" if the key is actually present in the commands.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_commands` function:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []

    if "name" in to_remove:  # Check for "name" instead of "vlan_id"
        commands.append("no name")

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if key == "vlan_id" or value is None:
            continue

        commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```
