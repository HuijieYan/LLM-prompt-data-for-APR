The issue seems to be related to the behavior of the `generate_commands` function in handling the `to_set` and `to_remove` parameters. The bug occurs because the function mistakenly removes the `to_remove` keys without checking if they exist in the `to_set` dictionary. This causes the "no {key}" commands to be executed even when the corresponding key exists in the `to_set` dictionary.

To fix this issue, the function should check if the keys present in `to_remove` also exist in `to_set` before adding the "no {key}" commands.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_commands` function:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []

    if "vlan_id" in to_remove:
        return ["no vlan {0}".format(vlan_id)]

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if key == "vlan_id" or value is None:
            continue

        commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    for key in to_remove:
        if key in to_set:
            commands.append("no {0}".format(key))

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
``` 

By checking if the keys in `to_remove` also exist in `to_set`, the corrected function ensures that the "no {key}" commands are only added if the corresponding key is present in `to_set`. This should resolve the unexpected behavior observed in the given test case.
