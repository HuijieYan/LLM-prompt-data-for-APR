The issue with the `generate_commands` function is that it's incorrectly handling the `to_remove` dictionary. It checks if "vlan_id" is in `to_remove`, but it should be checking the `vlan_id` attribute against the `to_remove` dictionary.

The reason for the bug is that the function is mistakenly checking for the existence of "vlan_id" as a key in the `to_remove` dictionary, but it should be looking for the `vlan_id` attribute within the `to_remove` dictionary.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to access the `vlan_id` attribute directly from the `to_remove` dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_commands` function:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []
    if "vlan_id" in to_remove.get('vlan_id', []):
        return ["no vlan {0}".format(vlan_id)]

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if key == "vlan_id" or value is None:
            continue

        commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    for key in to_remove.keys():
        commands.append("no {0}".format(key))

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```
