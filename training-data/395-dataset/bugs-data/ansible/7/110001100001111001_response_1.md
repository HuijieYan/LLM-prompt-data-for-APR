Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the logic for appending the "no" commands to the list of commands to remove. 

Reasons behind the bug: The bug occurs because the function is only checking if "vlan_id" is in the `to_remove` dictionary, but it should be checking the specific VLAN ID that needs to be removed. Additionally, the logic for appending "no" commands to the list of commands to remove is not correct.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the specific VLAN ID in the `to_remove` dictionary instead of just checking for "vlan_id".
2. Update the logic for appending "no" commands to the list of commands to remove to ensure it correctly removes the corresponding VLAN attributes.

Corrected code:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if key == "vlan_id" or value is None:
            continue

        commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    if "name" in to_remove:
        commands.append("no name")

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```
