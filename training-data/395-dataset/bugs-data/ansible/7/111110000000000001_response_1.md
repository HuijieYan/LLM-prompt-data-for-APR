Potential error location: 
The condition "if "vlan_id" in to_remove" is checking for the string "vlan_id" in the dictionary to_remove, but it should be checking for vlan_id as a key.

Reasons behind the bug: 
The buggy function is not correctly handling the vlan_id and is not correctly checking if it needs to remove the vlan.

Approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Update the condition to check for the key "vlan_id" in the to_remove dictionary.
2. Change the comparison to key instead of "vlan_id" to handle the vlan_id correctly.
3. Ensure that the function correctly creates the commands to set and remove VLAN configurations.

Corrected code:
```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []
    if vlan_id in to_remove:
        commands.append("no vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if key == "vlan_id" or value is None:
            continue
        commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    for key in to_remove:
        commands.append("no {0}".format(key))

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```
