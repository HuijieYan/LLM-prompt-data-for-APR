The issue here seems to be that when a key from the `to_set` dictionary matches the key "vlan_id" or its value is None, it is being skipped. This is causing the "no name" command to be appended to the `commands` list in the buggy function.

To fix this bug, we need to update the condition in the for loop that iterates through the `to_set` dictionary. We should remove the check for the "vlan_id" key and its value being None, as we want to include all key-value pairs from `to_set` in the `commands` list.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []
    if "name" in to_remove:  # Changed "vlan_id" to "name"
        return ["no name"]  # Changed "vlan" to "name"

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if value is not None:  # Removed the check for key == "vlan_id"
            commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    for key in to_remove:
        commands.append("no {0}".format(key))

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```

By making these changes, all key-value pairs from the `to_set` dictionary will be included in the `commands` list, and the "no name" command will be added only if "name" is in the `to_remove` dictionary. This should address the bug and produce the expected results.
