The problem in the `generate_commands` function is that it is not correctly handling the `to_remove` dictionary. The function checks if "vlan_id" is in the `to_remove` dictionary, when it should be checking if "name" is in the `to_remove` dictionary.

The test case `test_eos_vlan_replaced` is failing because the expected result contains the command "no name", which is not being generated by the `generate_commands` function.

To fix this bug, the function should check if "name" is in the `to_remove` dictionary, and if so, append "no name" to the list of commands.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []

    if "name" in to_remove:
        commands.append("no name")

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if key == "vlan_id" or value is None:
            continue
        commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    for key in to_remove:
        commands.append("no {0}".format(key))

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```
