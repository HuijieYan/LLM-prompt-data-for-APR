The test case "test_eos_vlan_replaced" is trying to execute the "execute_module" function and comparing the expected commands with the actual commands. The error message indicates that the actual commands differ from the expected commands.

The issue seems to be with the "generate_commands" function as it is responsible for generating the commands based on the inputs.

The bug occurs because the condition "if "vlan_id" in to_remove" should be "if vlan_id in to_remove". The current condition is checking for the string "vlan_id" instead of the variable.

To fix the bug, the condition in the "generate_commands" function needs to be updated. Additionally, the logic for appending commands also needs to be revised.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []
    if vlan_id in to_remove:  # Updated condition
        return ["no vlan {0}".format(vlan_id)]

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if key == "vlan_id" or value is None:
            continue

        commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    for key in to_remove:
        commands.append("no {0}".format(key))

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```

With these changes, the "generate_commands" function should correctly generate the expected commands, and the test case should pass without any assertion errors.
