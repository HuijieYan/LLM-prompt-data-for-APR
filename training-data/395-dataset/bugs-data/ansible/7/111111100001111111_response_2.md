The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of the "to_remove" dictionary. The function is checking if "vlan_id" is in "to_remove", but it should be checking if the key "vlan_id" is in the dictionary "to_remove" instead.

The reason for the bug is that the function is incorrectly handling the "to_remove" dictionary. It should check for the presence of the "vlan_id" key in the dictionary, but it is currently checking for the literal string "vlan_id".

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional check for "vlan_id" in the "to_remove" dictionary. Additionally, we should update the expected output for the test case to reflect the corrected behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []
    if "vlan_id" in to_remove.keys():  # Check if "vlan_id" is in the keys of to_remove
        return ["no vlan {0}".format(vlan_id)]

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if key == "vlan_id" or value is None:
            continue

        commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    for key in to_remove:
        commands.append("no {0}".format(key))

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```

With this correction, the function should handle the "to_remove" dictionary correctly, and the test case should produce the expected output as mentioned in the issue description.
