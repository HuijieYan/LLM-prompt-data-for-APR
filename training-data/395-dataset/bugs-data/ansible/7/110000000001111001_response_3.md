The bug in the provided function is that it is checking for the key "vlan_id" in the dictionary `to_remove`, but it should be checking for the key `vlan_id` in the `to_set` dictionary. 

The reason for the bug is that the if statement `if "vlan_id" in to_remove:` is incorrectly checking the wrong dictionary for the key "vlan_id", leading to the wrong commands being generated.

To fix the bug, the function needs to check if "vlan_id" is in the `to_set` dictionary instead of the `to_remove` dictionary. Additionally, the if statement `if key == "vlan_id" or value is None:` should be removed, as it is not necessary.

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if value is not None:
            commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    for key in to_remove:
        commands.append("no {0}".format(key))

    commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```
