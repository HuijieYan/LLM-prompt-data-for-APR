The issue seems to be related to the behavior of the `generate_commands` function when setting the VLAN name and then removing it. 

The bug is likely occurring in the line `if "vlan_id" in to_remove:` as it is checking for "vlan_id" in `to_remove` instead of `to_set`. This means that when trying to remove the VLAN name, it is not detected and hence not removed.

To fix this bug, we should check if "name" is present in the `to_set` dictionary and add it to the `to_remove` list if it's present. Then we can remove it when generating the commands.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_commands` function:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []

    if "name" in to_set:
        to_remove.append("name")

    if "vlan_id" in to_remove:
        return ["no vlan {0}".format(vlan_id)]

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if value is None:
            continue
        commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    for key in to_remove:
        commands.append("no {0}".format(key))

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```
