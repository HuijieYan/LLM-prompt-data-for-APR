The bug is occurring due to a wrong check in the `generate_commands` function. The function is incorrectly checking if "vlan_id" is in `to_remove` instead of checking if `vlan_id` key is in the `to_remove` dictionary.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly check for the presence of the "vlan_id" key in the `to_remove` dictionary. Additionally, the function should also include the "vlan_id" in the list of keys to remove if it exists in the `to_remove` dictionary.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []

    if "vlan_id" in to_remove:
        return ["no vlan {0}".format(vlan_id)]

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if value is not None:
            commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    for key in to_remove:
        if key == "vlan_id":
            commands.append("no vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))
        else:
            commands.append("no {0}".format(key))

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```

With this correction, the function should now behave as expected and should return the correct list of commands based on the input parameters.
