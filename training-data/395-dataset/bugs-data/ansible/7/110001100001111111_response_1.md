The problem here is that the loop that removes keys from the `to_remove` dictionary is mistakenly removing keys from the `to_set` dictionary as well. This is happening because the loop is not checking if the key exists in the `to_set` dictionary before removing it.

To fix this bug, we need to update the loop that removes keys to only remove keys from the `to_remove` dictionary, not the `to_set` dictionary. We can achieve this by adding a condition to check if the key exists in the `to_remove` dictionary before removing it.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []
    if "vlan_id" in to_remove:
        return ["no vlan {0}".format(vlan_id)]

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if key == "vlan_id" or value is None:
            continue

        commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    for key in to_remove:
        if key in to_set:
            commands.append("no {0}".format(key))

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```

After fixing the function, the expected output with the given input parameters will be:
```
['vlan 10', 'name tenreplaced', 'state suspend', 'no name']
```
