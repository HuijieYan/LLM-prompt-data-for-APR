The potential error in the provided function is with the if condition `if "vlan_id" in to_remove:`. The intention behind this if condition seems to be to check if the key "vlan_id" exists in the `to_remove` dictionary, but due to the use of quotes around `vlan_id`, it is treated as a string literal instead of the variable `vlan_id`. This is resulting in the incorrect check and is not achieving the intended functionality.

The reason for the bug is that the condition `if "vlan_id" in to_remove` is always evaluating as False because the string "vlan_id" is not actually in `to_remove`, and as a result, the "no vlan {0}" command is never added to the commands list.

To fix this bug, the condition needs to be changed to check if the variable `vlan_id` is in `to_remove` instead of the string "vlan_id".

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []

    if vlan_id in to_remove:  # Check if vlan_id is in to_remove
        commands.append("no vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if key == "vlan_id" or value is None:
            continue
        commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    for key in to_remove:
        commands.append("no {0}".format(key))

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly add the "no vlan {0}" command to the commands list if the vlan_id exists in the to_remove dictionary.
