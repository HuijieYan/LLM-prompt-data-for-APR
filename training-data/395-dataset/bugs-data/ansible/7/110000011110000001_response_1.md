The error message is coming from the `test_eos_vlan_replaced` function, where it is comparing the expected `commands` list with the actual `commands` list returned from the `execute_module` function.

The potential error in the `generate_commands` function seems to be in the conditions for checking if "vlan_id" is in `to_remove` and iterating through the `to_set` items.

The issue in the code is that the condition checking for "vlan_id" in `to_remove` is incorrect. It should be checking for `vlan_id` instead of "vlan_id". Additionally, the iteration for `to_set` should not continue if the value is `None`.

To fix the issue, the code should be modified to:
```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []
    if vlan_id in to_remove:  # Fixed condition check
        return ["no vlan {0}".format(vlan_id)]

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if key != "vlan_id" and value is not None:  # Fix iteration condition and value check
            commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    for key in to_remove:
        commands.append("no {0}".format(key))

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```

This corrected code addresses the issues identified and should resolve the error message seen in the test function.
