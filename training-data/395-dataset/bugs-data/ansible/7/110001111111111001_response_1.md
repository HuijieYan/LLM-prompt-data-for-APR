The error stems from the mismatch in the order of elements and the presence of an additional element in the `commands` list. 

Upon analyzing the function, the issue seems to arise from the loop for `to_remove` items. The current implementation only appends `no {key}` to the `commands` list, but it should be appending `no {value}` as well. This causes the mismatch in the test case output.

To fix the bug, the function `generate_commands` needs to be modified to include the `to_set` and `to_remove` items properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_commands` function:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if key == "vlan_id" or value is None:
            continue

        commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    for key in to_remove:
        commands.append("no {0}".format(key))
        commands.append("no {0}".format(to_remove[key]))

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
``` 

This updated code resolves the issue by properly appending `no {value}` for each item in `to_remove`.
