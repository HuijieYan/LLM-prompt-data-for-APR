The bug occurs in the for loop that appends the "no" command for each key in the "to_remove" dictionary. The bug causes the "no" command to be added for keys that are not present in the "to_set" dictionary, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the for loop to only append the "no" command for keys that are also present in the "to_set" dictionary. This will ensure that the "no" command is only added for keys that are being removed.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if key == "vlan_id" or value is None:
            continue
        commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))
    
    for key in to_remove:
        if key in to_set:
            commands.append("no {0}".format(key))

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```

This fix ensures that the "no" command is only added for keys that are present in the "to_set" dictionary, avoiding the unexpected behavior observed in the bug report.
