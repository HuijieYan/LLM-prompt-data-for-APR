Potential error location: 

The potential error location is within the for loop that iterates over `to_set` items. The condition `if key == "vlan_id" or value is None` skips the iteration if the key is "vlan_id" or the value is None, which is not the intended behavior based on the test case.

Reasons behind the bug: 

The condition `if key == "vlan_id" or value is None` skips the iteration for the key "vlan_id", which is not the expected behavior. Additionally, the "no" commands are not being properly handled as per the test case, which leads to issues with removing the correct commands.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:

1. Remove the condition `if key == "vlan_id" or value is None` to prevent skipping the iteration for the "vlan_id" key.
2. Adjust the handling of "no" commands to correctly remove the specified commands.

Corrected code:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if value is not None:
            commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    for key in to_remove:
        if key != "vlan_id":
            commands.append("no {0}".format(key))

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```
