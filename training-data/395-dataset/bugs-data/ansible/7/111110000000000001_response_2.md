Potential error location: 
The if statement "if "vlan_id" in to_remove" is checking for the string "vlan_id" in the to_remove list, which is probably not the intended behavior.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The if statement "if "vlan_id" in to_remove" is checking for the string "vlan_id" in the to_remove list instead of checking for the key "vlan_id" in the dictionary.
2. The condition "if key == "vlan_id" or value is None" is incorrectly structured, as it assumes that the key is "vlan_id" when it should be comparing with vlan_id that is input to the function.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Change the if statement to check for the key "vlan_id" in the to_remove dictionary.
2. Modify the condition "if key == "vlan_id" or value is None" to correctly compare the key with the input vlan_id.

Corrected code:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []

    if vlan_id in to_remove:
        commands.append("no vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if key == vlan_id or value is None:
            continue

        commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    for key in to_remove:
        commands.append("no {0}".format(key))

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```
