The issue in the `generate_commands` function is that when "to_remove" contains a key "name", it adds "no name" to the commands list. However, it should be removed from the "to_set" dictionary instead.

The error in the test case stems from the incorrect handling of the "no name" command, leading to a mismatch with the expected commands list.

To fix this issue, the logic for handling the "name" field should be modified. The "no name" command should be removed from the "commands" list, and instead, the "name" key and its corresponding value should be removed from the "to_set" dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_commands` function:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []

    if "vlan_id" in to_remove:
        return ["no vlan {0}".format(vlan_id)]

    # Remove the 'name' key from to_set if it exists in to_remove
    if "name" in to_remove:
        del to_set["name"]
        commands.append("no name")

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if value is not None:
            commands.append(f"{key} {value}")

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, f"vlan {vlan_id}")

    return commands
```

With this change, the "no name" command will be correctly handled, and the test case should pass without errors.
