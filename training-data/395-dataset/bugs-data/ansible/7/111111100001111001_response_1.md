The bug in the `generate_commands` function lies in the condition `if "vlan_id" in to_remove:`. The intention of this condition is to check if the key "vlan_id" exists in the `to_remove` dictionary, but it is incorrectly written as a string literal "vlan_id" instead of a variable reference `vlan_id`.

This results in the condition always evaluating to `False` and the "no vlan {0}".format(vlan_id) command is never being added to the `commands` list.

To fix this bug, the condition should be changed to `if vlan_id in to_remove:`.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_commands` function:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []
    if vlan_id in to_remove:
        commands.append("no vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if key == "vlan_id" or value is None:
            continue
        commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    for key in to_remove:
        commands.append("no {0}".format(key))

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```
