Potential Error Location: 
The if statement "if "vlan_id" in to_remove" is checking if the string "vlan_id" is in the list to_remove, but it should be checking if the integer vlan_id is in the list.

Reason for the Bug:
The if statement is checking the wrong condition, leading to incorrect checks and results.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Change the if statement to check if vlan_id is in to_remove instead of "vlan_id" in to_remove.
2. Also, update the for loop to only append "no" commands for keys that are in to_remove, not all.

Corrected Code:
```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []
    if vlan_id in to_remove:
        return ["no vlan {0}".format(vlan_id)]

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if key == "vlan_id" or value is None:
            continue

        commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    for key in to_remove:
        if key != vlan_id:
            commands.append("no {0}".format(key))

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```
