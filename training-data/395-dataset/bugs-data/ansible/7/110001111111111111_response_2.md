The issue here is that the "no" commands are being added to the commands list without checking if they are present in the to_remove dictionary. This is leading to the extra "no name" command being added, causing the assertion error in the test case.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the generate_commands function to correctly handle the to_remove dictionary and prevent unnecessary "no" commands from being added.

Here is the corrected code for the generate_commands function:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []
    if "name" in to_remove:  # Check specifically for "name" in to_remove
        commands.append("no name")  # Add "no name" command

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if key == "vlan_id" or value is None:
            continue

        commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    if commands:  # Only insert "vlan {0}" command if commands list is not empty
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```

With this change, the unnecessary "no" commands are only added if the corresponding keys are present in the to_remove dictionary. This should resolve the issue and the test case should pass without any assertion errors.
