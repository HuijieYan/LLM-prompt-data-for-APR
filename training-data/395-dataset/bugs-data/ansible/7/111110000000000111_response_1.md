The potential error in the provided code is with the line `if "vlan_id" in to_remove:`. It should be `if "vlan" in to_remove:` because "to_remove" is a list that contains strings. Also, the comparison should be with the "vlan" keyword, not "vlan_id".

The bug occurs because the code checks for "vlan_id" in the "to_remove" list, but the correct keyword to check for is "vlan" as the list contains keywords to be removed, not values.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be updated to check for "vlan" instead of "vlan_id" in the "to_remove" list.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []
    if "vlan" in to_remove:  # check for "vlan" instead of "vlan_id"
        return ["no vlan {0}".format(vlan_id)]

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if key == "vlan_id" or value is None:
            continue

        commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    for key in to_remove:
        commands.append("no {0}".format(key))

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```
