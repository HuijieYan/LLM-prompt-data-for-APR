Potential error location: The if condition to check for "vlan_id" in to_remove is incorrect as it is using quotes around "vlan_id" which means it is looking for the string "vlan_id" in the dictionary key, instead of the actual value of vlan_id.

Reason behind the bug: The incorrect if condition is preventing the "no vlan {0}" command from being added to the commands list when the vlan_id needs to be removed.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Remove the quotes around "vlan_id" in the if condition, and also change the if condition to check if vlan_id is in the keys of to_remove instead of checking for "vlan_id" specifically.

Corrected code:
```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []
    if vlan_id in to_remove:
        return ["no vlan {0}".format(vlan_id)]

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if key == "vlan_id" or value is None:
            continue

        commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    for key in to_remove:
        commands.append("no {0}".format(key))

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```
