The problem occurs because the code is incorrectly checking for "vlan_id" in the `to_remove` dictionary. It should be checking for the actual `vlan_id` provided as a parameter to the function.

Additionally, the code is adding the "no" commands for removal at the wrong place. It should be added before any other set commands.

To fix the bug, we need to do the following:
1. Change the condition `if "vlan_id" in to_remove` to `if "vlan_id" in to_remove.keys()`.
2. Change `commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))` to `commands.append("no {0}".format(key))` for removing commands.
3. Move the insertion of removal commands to the beginning of the `commands` list, before any other set commands.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []

    if "vlan_id" in to_remove.keys():
        commands.append("no vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if key == "vlan_id" or value is None:
            continue
        commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    for key in to_remove:
        commands.insert(0, "no {0}".format(key))

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```
