The bug seems to be related to the behavior of the `generate_commands` function in the `eos_vlans` module. The user is expecting the `vlan_id` to override other data, but the `name` attribute is being removed for some reason, resulting in unexpected behavior.

Upon analyzing the `generate_commands` function, it seems that the issue might be related to the condition `if "vlan_id" in to_remove`, which is checking for the presence of the 'vlan_id' key in the `to_remove` dictionary. However, it should instead be checking for the presence of the 'name' key, as the user is experiencing issues with the 'name' attribute being removed.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the condition is incorrectly checking for the 'vlan_id' key instead of the 'name' key, which results in the 'name' attribute not being handled as expected.

To fix the bug, the condition should be updated to check for the presence of the 'name' key in the `to_remove` dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_commands` function:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []
    
    if "name" in to_remove:  # Update the condition to check for the presence of 'name' key
        commands.append("no name")

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if key == "vlan_id" or value is None:
            continue

        commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    for key in to_remove:
        if key != "name":  # Skip adding 'no name' command as it's handled separately
            commands.append("no {0}".format(key))

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```

With this correction, the `generate_commands` function should now correctly handle the 'name' attribute and not remove it unexpectedly.
