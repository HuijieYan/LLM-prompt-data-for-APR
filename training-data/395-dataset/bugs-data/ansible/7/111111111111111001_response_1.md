The issue with the buggy function `generate_commands` is in handling the removal of keys from the dictionary `to_remove`. The code currently checks if "vlan_id" is in to_remove and returns a specific command, but it should be checking if the key "vlan_id" is in to_remove.keys().

The reason for the bug is that the function does not correctly handle the removal of keys from the `to_remove` dictionary. It is currently assuming that "vlan_id" is directly in the `to_remove` dictionary, which is not the case.

To fix the bug, the function should check for the presence of the key "vlan_id" in the `to_remove` dictionary using `if "vlan_id" in to_remove.keys():` instead of `if "vlan_id" in to_remove:`.

Additionally, the function should also append "no {key}" for each key in `to_remove` to the `commands` list. 

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []
    if "vlan_id" in to_remove.keys():
        commands.append("no vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if key == "vlan_id" or value is None:
            continue
        commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    for key in to_remove:
        commands.append("no {0}".format(key))

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```
