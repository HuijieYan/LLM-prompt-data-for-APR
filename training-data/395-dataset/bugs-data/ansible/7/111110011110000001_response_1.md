The error occurs because the "no" prefix is not being added for the attributes to be removed. For example, in the test, the "name" attribute is being replaced, so the command should include "no name".

The potential error location is identified in the loop where commands for attributes to be removed are being added using the "no" prefix.

The bug occurs because the loop for attributes to be removed is not adding the "no" prefix to the key when creating commands. This results in the absence of the "no" prefix in the output commands, leading to the assertion error in the test case.

To fix the bug, we need to update the loop for attributes to be removed to add the "no" prefix to the key when creating commands for removal.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []
    if "vlan_id" in to_remove:
        return ["no vlan {0}".format(vlan_id)]

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if key == "vlan_id" or value is None:
            continue

        commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    for key in to_remove:
        commands.append("no {0}".format(key))  # Fix: Add "no" prefix for attributes to be removed

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```
