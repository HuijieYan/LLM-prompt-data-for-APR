The error message indicates a TypeError occurring at the `for api in apis:` line inside the `from_name` method. This is likely because the `apis` variable is expected to be iterable, but it's being passed as a single `GalaxyAPI` object instead.

The potential error location is the `collection.verify_collections` function where the `from_name` method is being called with `apis` as an argument.

The bug occurred because the `from_name` method is expecting `apis` to be an iterable object, but it's being passed a single object (`GalaxyAPI`).

To fix this bug, we can modify the `collection.verify_collections` function to pass `apis` as an iterable, which might mean creating a list or tuple containing the `GalaxyAPI` object.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def verify_collections(collections, search_paths, apis, validate_certs, ignore_errors, allow_pre_release=False):
    with _display_progress():
        with _tempdir() as b_temp_path:
            for collection in collections:
                try:

                    # ... (code omitted for brevity) ...

                    # Download collection on a galaxy server for comparison
                    try:
                        remote_collection = CollectionRequirement.from_name(collection_name, [apis], collection_version, False, parent=None,
                                                                            allow_pre_release=allow_pre_release)
                    except AnsibleError as e:
                        if e.message == 'Failed to find collection %s:%s' % (collection[0], collection[1]):
                            raise AnsibleError('Failed to find remote collection %s:%s on any of the galaxy servers' % (collection[0], collection[1]))
                        raise

                    # ... (code omitted for brevity) ...

                except AnsibleError as err:
                    if ignore_errors:
                        display.warning("Failed to verify collection %s but skipping due to --ignore-errors being set. "
                                        "Error: %s" % (collection[0], to_text(err)))
                    else:
                        raise
``` 

In the corrected code, the `apis` argument is now wrapped in a list `[apis]` when passing it to the `from_name` method, which ensures it's iterable.
