Potential error location: The error might occur in the section where the download_url is being used to download a remote collection for comparison.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug could be occurring due to incorrect handling of the download URL or invalid comparison logic.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Properly handling the download URL and ensuring it is valid.
2. Implementing correct comparison logic for local and remote collections.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def verify_collections(collections, search_paths, apis, validate_certs, ignore_errors, allow_pre_release=False):
    
    with _display_progress():
        with _tempdir() as b_temp_path:

                    collection_name = collection[0]
                    namespace, name = collection_name.split('.')
                    collection_version = collection[1]

                    # Verify local collection exists before downloading it from a galaxy server
                    for search_path in search_paths:
                        b_search_path = to_bytes(os.path.join(search_path, namespace, name), errors='surrogate_or_strict')
                        if os.path.isdir(b_search_path):
                            local_collection = CollectionRequirement.from_path(b_search_path, False)
                            break
                    if local_collection is None:
                        raise AnsibleError(message='Collection %s is not installed in any of the collection paths.' % collection_name)

                    # Download collection from a galaxy server for comparison
                    remote_collection = CollectionRequirement.from_name(collection_name, apis, collection_version, False, parent=None, allow_pre_release=allow_pre_release)

                    download_url = remote_collection.metadata().get('download_url')
                    headers = {}

                    b_temp_tar_path = _download_file(download_url, b_temp_path, None, validate_certs, headers=headers)

                    local_collection.verify(remote_collection, search_path, b_temp_tar_path)

                except AnsibleError as err:
                    if ignore_errors:
                        display.warning("Failed to verify collection %s but skipping due to --ignore-errors being set. "
                                        "Error: %s" % (collection[0], to_text(err)))
                    else:
                        raise
