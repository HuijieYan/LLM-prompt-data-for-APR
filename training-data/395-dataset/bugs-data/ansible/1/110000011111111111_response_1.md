The error message states that the TypeError occurred in the `from_name` method within the `verify_collections` function. The error indicates that the `apis` parameter is not iterable.

Upon reviewing the `verify_collections` function, it seems that the issue is with the `apis` parameter being passed to the `from_name` method. It is being passed as a single object, but the `from_name` method expects an iterable for the `apis` parameter. This suggests that the `apis` parameter should be an iterable, but it is being used as a single object.

To fix this issue, we need to pass the `apis` as an iterable to the `from_name` method. This can be achieved by wrapping the `apis` in a list or tuple before passing it to the method.

Here's the corrected code for the `verify_collections` function:

```python
def verify_collections(collections, search_paths, apis, validate_certs, ignore_errors, allow_pre_release=False):

    with _display_progress():
        with _tempdir() as b_temp_path:
            for collection in collections:
                try:

                    local_collection = None
                    b_collection = to_bytes(collection[0], errors='surrogate_or_strict')

                    if os.path.isfile(b_collection) or urlparse(collection[0]).scheme.lower() in ['http', 'https'] or len(collection[0].split('.')) != 2:
                        raise AnsibleError(message="'%s' is not a valid collection name. The format namespace.name is expected." % collection[0])

                    collection_name = collection[0]
                    namespace, name = collection_name.split('.')
                    collection_version = collection[1]

                    # Verify local collection exists before downloading it from a galaxy server
                    for search_path in search_paths:
                        b_search_path = to_bytes(os.path.join(search_path, namespace, name), errors='surrogate_or_strict')
                        if os.path.isdir(b_search_path):
                            local_collection = CollectionRequirement.from_path(b_search_path, False)
                            break
                    if local_collection is None:
                        raise AnsibleError(message='Collection %s is not installed in any of the collection paths.' % collection_name)

                    # Download collection on a galaxy server for comparison
                    try:
                        remote_collection = CollectionRequirement.from_name(collection_name, [apis], collection_version, False, parent=None,
                                                                            allow_pre_release=allow_pre_release)  # Pass apis as an iterable
                    except AnsibleError as e:
                        if e.message == 'Failed to find collection %s:%s' % (collection[0], collection[1]):
                            raise AnsibleError('Failed to find remote collection %s:%s on any of the galaxy servers' % (collection[0], collection[1]))
                        raise

                    download_url = remote_collection.metadata.download_url
                    headers = {}
                    remote_collection.api._add_auth_token(headers, download_url, required=False)
                    b_temp_tar_path = _download_file(download_url, b_temp_path, None, validate_certs, headers=headers)

                    local_collection.verify(remote_collection, search_path, b_temp_tar_path)

                except AnsibleError as err:
                    if ignore_errors:
                        display.warning("Failed to verify collection %s but skipping due to --ignore-errors being set. "
                                        "Error: %s" % (collection[0], to_text(err)))
                    else:
                        raise
```
In the corrected code, the `apis` parameter is modified to be passed as `[apis]` to make it an iterable before being passed to the `from_name` method.
