The error message indicates a TypeError: 'GalaxyAPI' object is not iterable. This error occurs at the `for api in apis` loop in the `from_name` method of the `CollectionRequirement` class. The `apis` variable is expected to be iterable (like a list), but it appears to be a single object of type `GalaxyAPI`.

The potential error location within the `verify_collections` function is when calling the `CollectionRequirement.from_name` method with the `apis` argument.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `apis` argument is expected to be an iterable (like a list of `GalaxyAPI` objects), but it is not being passed correctly as an iterable.

To fix this bug, the `apis` variable should be passed as an iterable (list, tuple, etc.) to the `from_name` method. It seems that the intention was to pass a list of `GalaxyAPI` objects but currently, it is being passed as a single `GalaxyAPI` object.

Below is the corrected `verify_collections` function:
