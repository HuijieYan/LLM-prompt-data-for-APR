The error message indicates that the bug occurs in the `from_name` method of the `CollectionRequirement` class in the `galaxy/collection.py` file. It states a `TypeError: 'GalaxyAPI' object is not iterable`, which means that the `apis` parameter passed to the `from_name` method is being used as an iterable (probably in a for loop), but it is not iterable.

The bug occurs because the `apis` parameter passed to the `from_name` method is expected to be iterable, but it is being passed a single `GalaxyAPI` object instead.

To fix this bug, the `apis` parameter should be passed as an iterable (e.g., a list) containing the `GalaxyAPI` object.

Here's the corrected code for the `verify_collections` function:

```python
def verify_collections(collections, search_paths, apis, validate_certs, ignore_errors, allow_pre_release=False):
    with _display_progress():
        with _tempdir() as b_temp_path:
            for collection in collections:
                try:
                    # existing code remains the same

                    # Download collection on a galaxy server for comparison
                    remote_collection = CollectionRequirement.from_name(
                        collection_name, [apis], collection_version, False, parent=None, 
                        allow_pre_release=allow_pre_release
                    )
                    
                    # existing code remains the same

                except AnsibleError as err:
                    if ignore_errors:
                        display.warning(
                            "Failed to verify collection %s but skipping due to --ignore-errors being set. "
                            "Error: %s" % (collection[0], to_text(err))
                        )
                    else:
                        raise
```

In the corrected code, the `apis` parameter is passed as a list `[apis]` to ensure that it is treated as an iterable, even if it contains only one `GalaxyAPI` object.
