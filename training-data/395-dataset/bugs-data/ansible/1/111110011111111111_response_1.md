The error occurs at the line `for api in apis:` in the `from_name` method of the `CollectionRequirement` class. The error message indicates that `apis` is not an iterable object, which means it cannot be looped over as if it were a list.

The reason for this bug is likely that the `apis` variable is expected to be iterable, but it is of the wrong type or structure.

One approach to fixing this bug is to ensure that the `apis` variable passed to the `from_name` method is iterable, such as a list or a tuple. It's possible that the `apis` variable is being passed incorrectly or not being initialized correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `verify_collections` function:

```python
def verify_collections(collections, search_paths, apis, validate_certs, ignore_errors, allow_pre_release=False):
    with _display_progress():
        with _tempdir() as b_temp_path:
            for collection in collections:
                try:
                    local_collection = None
                    b_collection = to_bytes(collection[0], errors='surrogate_or_strict')

                    if os.path.isfile(b_collection) or urlparse(collection[0]).scheme.lower() in ['http', 'https'] or len(collection[0].split('.')) != 2:
                        raise AnsibleError(message="'%s' is not a valid collection name. The format namespace.name is expected." % collection[0])

                    collection_name = collection[0]
                    namespace, name = collection_name.split('.')
                    collection_version = collection[1]

                    for search_path in search_paths:
                        b_search_path = to_bytes(os.path.join(search_path, namespace, name), errors='surrogate_or_strict')
                        if os.path.isdir(b_search_path):
                            local_collection = CollectionRequirement.from_path(b_search_path, False)
                            break
                    if local_collection is None:
                        raise AnsibleError(message='Collection %s is not installed in any of the collection paths.' % collection_name)

                    remote_collection = CollectionRequirement.from_name(collection_name, [apis], collection_version, False, parent=None, allow_pre_release=allow_pre_release)

                    download_url = remote_collection.metadata.download_url
                    headers = {}
                    remote_collection.api._add_auth_token(headers, download_url, required=False)
                    b_temp_tar_path = _download_file(download_url, b_temp_path, None, validate_certs, headers=headers)

                    local_collection.verify(remote_collection, search_path, b_temp_tar_path)

                except AnsibleError as err:
                    if ignore_errors:
                        display.warning("Failed to verify collection %s but skipping due to --ignore-errors being set. "
                                        "Error: %s" % (collection[0], to_text(err)))
                    else:
                        raise
``` 

In the corrected code, the `from_name` method is called with `apis` as a list `[apis]` to ensure it is iterable. This should fix the TypeError issue mentioned in the error message.
