It seems that the problematic function is intended to verify collections by downloading them and comparing the local and remote versions. 

The potential error location within the function is the use of the `_display_progress()` and `_tempdir()` functions. It seems like these functions are intended to be context managers (used with the `with` keyword), but they are not defined as such.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the `_display_progress()` and `_tempdir()` functions are not defined as context managers, causing a syntax error when used with the `with` keyword.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to define `_display_progress()` and `_tempdir()` as context managers using the `@contextlib.contextmanager` decorator in Python.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function with the context managers defined:

```python
import contextlib

# existing code ...

def verify_collections(collections, search_paths, apis, validate_certs, ignore_errors, allow_pre_release=False):
    
    @contextlib.contextmanager
    def display_progress():
        try:
            yield
        finally:
            # ... omitted code ...
            pass

    @contextlib.contextmanager
    def tempdir():
        try:
            yield
        finally:
            # ... omitted code ...
            pass

    with display_progress():
        with tempdir() as b_temp_path:
            # ... existing code ...
            pass
```

With the context managers defined, the syntax error involving the `with` keyword and the `_display_progress()` and `_tempdir()` functions will be resolved.
