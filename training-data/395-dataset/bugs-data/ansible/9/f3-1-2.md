SUMMARY
Using the redhat_subscription module with pool_ids and no quantities on a physical server causes the quantity to be forced to 1. This results in a warning on stdout from redhat_subscription and a return code of 1. This causes the action to be marked as FAILED although subscription_manager does the right thing.

ISSUE TYPE
Bug Report
COMPONENT NAME
redhat_subscription

ANSIBLE VERSION
ansible 2.8.6
  config file = /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
  configured module search path = [u'/home/morrisa/.ansible/plugins/modules', u'/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
  ansible python module location = /usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages/ansible
  executable location = /usr/bin/ansible
  python version = 2.7.5 (default, Jun 11 2019, 14:33:56) [GCC 4.8.5 20150623 (Red Hat 4.8.5-39)]
CONFIGURATION
DEFAULT_ROLES_PATH(/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg) = [u'/etc/ansible/roles', u'/usr/share/ansible/roles']
OS / ENVIRONMENT
Tested with Ansible 2.9, not tested with the development version yet but the issue is still there in the code. Target OS Version is RedHat Enterprise Linux 7.6 on a two socket physical server.

STEPS TO REPRODUCE
Using a physical server with two sockets execute the equivalent of the yaml below.

- name: Same as above but subscribe to a specific pool by ID.
  redhat_subscription:
    state: present
    username: joe_user
    password: somepass
    pool_ids: 0123456789abcdef0123456789abcdef
EXPECTED RESULTS
I expect the system to be subscribed to a given pool.

ACTUAL RESULTS
This play fails with a warning on stdout that Quantity needs to be a multiple of 2 and a return code of 1. Subscription-manager does the right thing but the return code causes Ansible to choke.

In the main code if pool_ids is provided without a quantity then it is set to 1. This is not valid for a two socket physical server.
