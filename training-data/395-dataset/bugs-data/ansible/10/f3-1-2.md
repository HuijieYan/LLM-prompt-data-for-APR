SUMMARY
I have a pam.d file which has no comments and only pam directives in it. I was attempting to remove the very first one, which is also the first line of the file. This results in an error. By adding a dummy comment to the file as the first line, I was able to successfully remove the line I needed.

My guess is that because the append method does not set the prev and next linked-list properties when the line being append is the first line, the exception occurs. In the case of if self._head is None, prev and next should be set to None.

STEPS TO REPRODUCE
Example pam.d file that does not work (deepin-auth-keyboard):

auth	[success=2 default=ignore]	pam_lsass.so
auth	[success=1 default=ignore]	pam_unix.so nullok_secure try_first_pass
auth	requisite	pam_deny.so
auth	required	pam_permit.so
Playbook task:

- name: Remove lsass from Deepin pam.d
  pamd:
    name: deepin-auth-keyboard
    type: auth
    control: "[success=2 default=ignore]"
    module_path: pam_lsass.so
    state: absent
EXPECTED RESULTS
I expect that the first line of the file is removed
