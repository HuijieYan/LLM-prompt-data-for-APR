The issue seems to be related to the encoding of UTF-8 characters in the environment variable value. The buggy function attempts to fetch environment variable values using the os.getenv method, but it doesn't handle UTF-8 characters correctly. This results in the error message related to decoding issues.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the environment variable values are properly encoded and decoded. We can use the `os.environ` dictionary to access environment variables and handle encoding and decoding manually.

Here's the corrected code for the `env.py` file:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/ansible_12/lib/ansible/plugins/lookup/env.py
import os

def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
    ret = []
    for term in terms:
        var = term.split()[0]
        var_value = os.environ.get(var, '').encode('utf-8')  # Encode the variable value to UTF-8
        ret.append(var_value.decode('utf-8'))  # Decode the variable value to UTF-8
    return ret
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle UTF-8 encoded environment variable values and the issue related to decoding errors should be resolved.
