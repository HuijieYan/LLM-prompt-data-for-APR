The bug occurs in the `run` function of the `LookupModule` class. The function splits the input terms, takes the first part of the split term, and then uses it to retrieve the environment variable value with `os.getenv`. The bug occurs because the `os.getenv` method is unable to handle UTF-8 characters properly, leading to the function returning an empty string instead of the expected environment variable value.

To fix the bug, the recommended approach is to use Python's `os.environ.get` method instead of `os.getenv`. This method can handle UTF-8 characters properly and will return the expected environment variable value.

Here is the corrected code for the `run` function:

```python
import os

class LookupModule(LookupBase):
    # ... other code ...

    def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
    
        ret = []
        for term in terms:
            var = term.split()[0]
            ret.append(os.environ.get(var, ''))

        return ret
```

By using `os.environ.get` instead of `os.getenv`, the `run` function should now be able to properly handle UTF-8 characters in the environment variable values and return the expected results.
