The issue with the provided code is that it tries to extract environment variables using `os.getenv` without importing the `os` module. This causes the code to fail and return an empty string for each term.

To fix this issue, we need to import the `os` module at the beginning of the file. Then, we can call `os.getenv` to retrieve the environment variables.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import os

# class declaration containing the buggy function
class LookupModule(LookupBase):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # This is the corrected function
    def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
        ret = []
        for term in terms:
            var = term.split()[0]
            ret.append(os.getenv(var, ''))
        return ret
```

With this correction, the `os` module is imported, and `os.getenv` can be used to retrieve the environment variables. This should fix the issue and the function should work as expected.
