The bug in the provided function `run` is that it is trying to get the environment variable value using `os.getenv(var, '')`. However, it should be using `os.environ.get(var, '')` to obtain the environment variable value.

The error occurs because the function is using `os.getenv` instead of `os.environ.get`, which leads to an empty list being returned for all the test cases.

To fix the bug, the `run` function should be modified to use `os.environ.get` to retrieve the environment variable values.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
import os

def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
    ret = []
    for term in terms:
        var = term.split()[0]
        ret.append(os.environ.get(var, ''))
    return ret
```

The corrected function uses `os.environ.get` to get the environment variable values and appends them to the `ret` list, which is then returned.
