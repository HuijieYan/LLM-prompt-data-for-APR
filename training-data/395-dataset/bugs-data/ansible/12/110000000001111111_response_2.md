The bug in the provided function is that it attempts to split the term using a space and then looks for the resulting variable in the environment using `os.getenv()`. However, this approach assumes that the variable names are always the first part of the term, which may not be true in all cases, as shown in the test cases.

The function is also not handling the case where the environment variable contains UTF-8 characters, which is causing the lookup to fail with an error.

To fix the bug:
1. Instead of splitting the term and taking the first part as the variable name, we should directly use the term as the variable name for environment lookup.
2. We should handle the case where the environment variable value contains UTF-8 characters by appropriately encoding/decoding it.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import os

def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
    ret = []
    for term in terms:
        ret.append(os.getenv(term, '').encode('utf-8').decode('utf-8'))
    return ret
```

With this correction, the function directly uses the term as the variable name for environment lookup, and it also handles UTF-8 characters in the environment variable values.
