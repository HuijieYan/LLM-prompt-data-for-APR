The buggy function `run` splits each term in the input list `terms` and retrieves the environment variable corresponding to the split term. The retrieved values are then appended to the list `ret` and returned. However, the os module is not imported in the provided code, which leads to an error when trying to retrieve the environment variable.

To fix this bug, the os module needs to be imported at the beginning of the code. Once the os module is imported, the environment variables can be retrieved using `os.getenv()`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
import os

class LookupModule(LookupBase):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
        ret = []
        for term in terms:
            var = term.split()[0]
            ret.append(os.getenv(var, ''))
    
        return ret
```
By importing the `os` module at the beginning of the code, we ensure that the `os.getenv()` function can be used to retrieve the environment variables without encountering an error.
