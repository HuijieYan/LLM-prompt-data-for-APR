The buggy function `run` takes a list of environment variable names as input, retrieves their values from the system environment, and returns a list of these values.

The error occurs because the function splits the variable names in `terms` and only takes the first part, which would cause it to not retrieve the correct environment variable. It also does not handle the case where the environment variable is not found, which leads to an empty string being appended to the return list. 

To fix the bug, we should modify the function as follows:
1. Split each term at the `=` sign and take the first part as the variable name.
2. Use `os.environ.get` to get the environment variable, and if it is not found, append `None` to the return list instead of an empty string.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import os

class LookupModule(LookupBase):

    def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
        ret = []

        for term in terms:
            var = term.split('=')[0]  # Split each term at the `=` sign and take the first part as the variable name
            val = os.environ.get(var)  # Use `os.environ.get` to get the environment variable
            ret.append(val if val is not None else '')  # Append `None` to the return list if the environment variable is not found

        return ret
```
