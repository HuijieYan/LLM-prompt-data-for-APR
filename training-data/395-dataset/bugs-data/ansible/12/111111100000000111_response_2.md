Potential error location: 
The error is likely occurring when attempting to retrieve the environment variable value using `os.getenv(var, '')`. The usage of `os.getenv` in Python 2.7 may not handle UTF-8 characters properly, leading to the error.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
Python 2.7's `os.getenv` may not handle UTF-8 characters properly, leading to decoding errors when retrieving environment variable values.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use Python 3.x's `os.getenv` method, which handles UTF-8 characters properly.
2. Manually decode the environment variable value using the `decode('utf-8')` method to handle UTF-8 characters.

Corrected code:

```python
import os

# class declaration containing the corrected function
class LookupModule(LookupBase):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # the corrected function
    def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
        ret = []
        for term in terms:
            var = term.split()[0]
            value = os.getenv(var, '').decode('utf-8')  # Manually decode the environment variable value
            ret.append(value)

        return ret
```
