Potential error location:
The issue lies within the `run` function where the `os.getenv` method is used to retrieve environment variable values. The bug is likely due to encoding issues as the function is not handling UTF-8 characters properly.

Reasons behind the bug occurrence:
The bug occurs because the `os.getenv` method does not handle non-ASCII characters properly, leading to encoding errors when trying to retrieve the values of environment variables that contain UTF-8 characters.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use Python's `os.environ.get` method instead of `os.getenv` to retrieve environment variable values. This method handles UTF-8 characters properly.
2. Explicitly set the encoding when retrieving the environment variable values to ensure proper handling of non-ASCII characters.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import os

class EnvLookupPlugin:
    def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
        ret = []
        for term in terms:
            var = term.split()[0]
            value = os.environ.get(var, '').encode('utf-8')
            ret.append(value.decode('utf-8'))
        return ret
```

In the corrected code, the `os.environ.get` method is used to retrieve the environment variable values, and the `encode` and `decode` methods are used to handle UTF-8 encoding and decoding. This should resolve the issue with UTF-8 characters in the environment variable values.
