The issue with the given function is that it always returns the value of the environment variable corresponding to the first word in the `terms` list, regardless of whether that environment variable exists or not. This behavior does not match the expected behavior described in the test cases because the function should return an empty string if the environment variable does not exist.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to check if the environment variable exists before appending its value to the `ret` list. If it exists, we append its value, otherwise, we append an empty string.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import os

def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
    ret = []
    for term in terms:
        var = term.split()[0]
        value = os.getenv(var)
        if value:
            ret.append(value)
        else:
            ret.append('')
    return ret
```
