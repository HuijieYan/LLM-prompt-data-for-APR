The error occurs in the `run` function of the `LookupModule` class. In this function, the environment variable value is being retrieved using `os.getenv(var, '')`, where `var` is the name of the environment variable. The bug occurs when the environment variable value contains UTF-8 characters. The function is not able to handle UTF-8 characters correctly, which leads to the assertion errors in the test cases.

To fix this bug, the function should use the `os.environ` dictionary directly to retrieve the environment variable value, and should not manipulate or split the environment variable name. This will ensure that UTF-8 characters are handled correctly.

The corrected code for the `run` function is as follows:

```python
import os

class LookupModule(LookupBase):

    # ...

    def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
        ret = []
        for term in terms:
            ret.append(os.environ.get(term, ''))
        return ret
```

By using `os.environ.get(term, '')`, the function is directly retrieving the value of the environment variable specified in the `term` variable and handling UTF-8 characters correctly. This should resolve the issue with the environment lookup plugin not handling UTF-8 characters properly.
