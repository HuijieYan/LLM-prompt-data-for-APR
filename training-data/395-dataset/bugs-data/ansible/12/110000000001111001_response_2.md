The issue with the provided function is that it attempts to split each term in the 'terms' list and extract the variable name, but it does not use the 'variables' input parameter in any way. Instead, it uses os.getenv which retrieves environment variables, and it stores the result in the 'ret' list without considering the 'variables' input parameter.

To fix this function, it should utilize the 'variables' input parameter to retrieve the values for the specified variables. Additionally, it should handle cases where the specified variables are not found in the environment by appending an empty string to the 'ret' list.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import os

def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
    ret = []
    for term in terms:
        if term in variables:
            ret.append(variables[term])
        else:
            ret.append('')

    return ret
```

In this corrected code, we use the 'variables' input parameter to retrieve the values for the specified variables. If the variable exists in the 'variables' dictionary, its value is appended to the 'ret' list. If not, an empty string is appended instead. This ensures that the 'ret' list contains the values for the specified variables or empty strings if the variables are not found.
