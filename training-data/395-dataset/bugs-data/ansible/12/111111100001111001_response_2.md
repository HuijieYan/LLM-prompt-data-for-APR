The buggy function takes a list of terms and returns a list containing the environment variable values for each term. However, the function is splitting each term on spaces and taking the first part as the variable name. This approach might not work for all cases, especially when the term itself contains spaces or is not a valid variable name.

To fix this, the function should directly use each term as the variable name and retrieve its value from the environment using os.getenv().

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import os

# class declaration containing the fixed function
class LookupModule(LookupBase):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
        ret = []
        for term in terms:
            ret.append(os.getenv(term, ''))
    
        return ret
```
