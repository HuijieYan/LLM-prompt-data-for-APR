The error is occurring due to the incorrect behavior of the `run` function in the `env` lookup plugin. The function is splitting the term and trying to retrieve the environment variable value using `os.getenv(var, '')`, but it's not correctly retrieving the environment variable values.

The bug is caused by the fact that the `os.getenv` method is unable to handle UTF8 characters properly, leading to incorrect results in the tests with UTF8 characters in the environment variable values.

To fix the bug, the function should use the `os.environ.get` method instead of `os.getenv`. The `os.environ.get` method can handle UTF8 characters properly and retrieve the environment variable values correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `run` function in the `env` lookup plugin:

```python
import os

def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
    ret = []
    for term in terms:
        var = term
        ret.append(os.environ.get(var, ''))

    return ret
```

With this change, the function will handle UTF8 characters correctly and retrieve the environment variable values as expected. This should resolve the issues with the tests and fix the bug in the `env` lookup plugin.
