The error in the provided code is caused by the incorrect usage of the `os.getenv` function. The function `os.getenv(var, '')` is being used to get the environment variable value, but it's not correctly handling the situation where the environment variable is not defined.

To fix this issue, the function should use `os.environ.get(var, '')` instead of `os.getenv(var, '')`. The `get` method of the `environ` dictionary will correctly handle cases where the environment variable is not defined, returning an empty string as specified in the default value.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
import os

def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
    ret = []
    for term in terms:
        var = term.split()[0]
        ret.append(os.environ.get(var, ''))

    return ret
```

By using `os.environ.get(var, '')` instead of `os.getenv(var, '')`, the function will be able to handle cases where the environment variable is not defined, and it should resolve the errors observed in the test cases.
