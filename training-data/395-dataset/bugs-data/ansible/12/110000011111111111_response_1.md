The problem with the `run` function is that it does not correctly handle the scenario where the environment variable value is not found. Instead of returning an empty string when the environment variable is not found, it returns the list containing the previous environment variable value.

To fix the bug, the function should check if the environment variable exists before appending its value to the `ret` list. If the environment variable is not found, it should append an empty string to the `ret` list.

Here's the corrected code for the `run` function:

```python
import os

def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
    ret = []
    for term in terms:
        var = term.split()[0]
        var_value = os.getenv(var, '')
        ret.append(var_value)

    return ret
```

With this correction, the function will check for the existence of the environment variable before appending its value to the `ret` list. If the environment variable is not found, it will append an empty string to the `ret` list.

This fix should resolve the issue and the test cases should now pass without errors. It will also address the reported GitHub issue related to UTF8 characters in the variable value.
