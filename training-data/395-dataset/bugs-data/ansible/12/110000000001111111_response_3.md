The buggy function `run` is attempting to retrieve the value of environment variables based on the input `terms` and add them to a list `ret`. However, the current implementation does not handle the case where the environment variable contains UTF-8 characters.

The issue occurs because the `os.getenv` function does not handle UTF-8 characters properly, resulting in the `ascii` codec error.

To fix the bug, we can use the `os.environ` dictionary directly to retrieve the environment variable values, as it handles UTF-8 characters properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `run` function:

```python
import os

def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
    ret = []
    for term in terms:
        var = term.split()[0]
        ret.append(os.environ.get(var, ''))
    return ret
```

With this change, the function should now be able to handle UTF-8 characters in the environment variable values without causing errors.
