The error is occurring because the function `run` is splitting the term using `split()` without specifying a delimiter, which is causing issues when retrieving the environment variables.

The potential error location is the line `var = term.split()[0]`. This line splits the `term` without specifying a delimiter, which may result in unexpected results.

The reason behind the bug is that `split()` without a delimiter splits the string by whitespace. If the environment variable does not contain any whitespaces, only the original value is being returned causing the assertions to fail in the tests.

To fix the bug:
1. We need to split the `term` using the `=` delimiter to separate the variable name and its value.
2. We also need to remove any leading or trailing whitespaces from the variable name.

Here's the corrected code for the `run` function:

```python
import os

# class declaration containing the corrected function
class LookupModule(LookupBase):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
        ret = []
        for term in terms:
            # split the term using '=' as a delimiter
            var, value = term.split('=', 1)
            # removing leading or trailing whitespaces from the variable name
            var = var.strip()
            ret.append(os.getenv(var, value))
        return ret
```
