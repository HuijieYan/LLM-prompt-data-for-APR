Based on the given information, it appears that the issue with the `env` lookup plugin arises when dealing with UTF-8 characters in the environment variable values. The problem occurs since Ansible 2.9 and only with Python 2.7.

The buggy function `run` attempts to retrieve environment variable values for each term in the input list. However, it splits the term and only uses the first part, assuming it is the variable name. This approach may lead to issues when handling UTF-8 characters or multi-word variable names.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to directly use the entire term as the variable name, without splitting it. Additionally, we need to handle the decoding of the UTF-8 characters properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `run` function:

```python
import os

def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
    ret = []
    for term in terms:
        ret.append(os.getenv(term, '').decode('utf-8'))
    return ret
```

By using the entire term as the variable name and decoding the environment variable value as UTF-8, we can address the issue with UTF-8 characters in the environment variable values.
