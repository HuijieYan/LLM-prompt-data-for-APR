The error occurs because the `os` module is used in the `run` method without being imported. This causes the `os.getenv` function to fail, resulting in the observed failures in the test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to import the `os` module at the beginning of the `env.py` file.

Here's the corrected code for the `run` method in the `env.py` file:

```python
import os

# ... omitted code ...

# this is the corrected run method
def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
    ret = []
    for term in terms:
        var = term.split()[0]
        ret.append(os.getenv(var, ''))
    return ret
```

By adding the `import os` statement at the beginning of the file, the `os.getenv` function will work as expected, and the test cases should pass without any errors.
