The issue seems to be related to the encoding of the environment variable value containing UTF-8 characters. The error message mentions that the 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xc3, indicating that there might be an encoding mismatch when trying to work with UTF-8 characters in Python 2.7.

To fix the issue, we can modify the `run` function inside the `env.py` file to handle the UTF-8 encoding properly. One way to do this is by explicitly specifying the encoding when retrieving the environment variable value using `os.getenv`.

Here's the corrected code for the `run` function:

```python
import os
import sys
# ... other necessary imports ...

# class declaration containing the corrected function
class LookupModule(LookupBase):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # the corrected function
    def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
        ret = []
        for term in terms:
            var = term.split()[0]
            value = os.getenv(var, '').decode(sys.getfilesystemencoding())
            ret.append(value)
        return ret
```

In the corrected code, we use `sys.getfilesystemencoding()` to decode the environment variable value with the appropriate encoding. This should handle the UTF-8 characters properly and avoid the encoding-related error mentioned in the GitHub issue.
