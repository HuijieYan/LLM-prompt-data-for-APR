Potential error location: The issue seems to be related to the use of the `os.getenv` function, which is failing to handle UTF-8 characters properly.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
- The use of `os.getenv` in the original function does not handle UTF-8 characters properly, leading to the error when trying to retrieve environment variable values containing UTF-8 characters.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Instead of using `os.getenv`, the `os.environ` dictionary can be used to directly access the environment variables. This would handle UTF-8 characters correctly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import os

def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
    ret = []
    for term in terms:
        var = term.split()[0]
        ret.append(os.environ.get(var, ''))
    return ret
```
