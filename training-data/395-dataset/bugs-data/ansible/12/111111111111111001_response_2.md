The issue seems to lie within the `run` function of the `LookupModule` class. The function is intended to retrieve environment variables using `os.getenv` and return their values in a list.

Looking at the error messages, the problem is that the function always returns an empty string (`''`) instead of the actual environment variable value.

The reason behind this bug is that the function is splitting the term and selecting the first part as the variable, but this is not a reliable approach, especially in cases where the environment variable may contain spaces or special characters.

To fix this bug, the function should directly use the term as the environment variable name and fetch its value using `os.getenv`.

Here's the corrected code for the `run` function:

```python
import os  # Add this import statement if it's not already present

def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
    ret = []
    for term in terms:
        ret.append(os.getenv(term, ''))
    return ret
```

This corrected code directly uses the term as the environment variable name and retrieves its value using `os.getenv`. This approach bypasses the need to split the term and ensures that the correct variable value is retrieved.
