Potential Error Location: The potential error in the run function is the use of the os module without importing it.

Reason behind the Bug: The os module is used in the function to access the environment variables, but it has not been imported in the code.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug: Import the os module at the beginning of the file to resolve the NameError when using os.getenv.

```python
import os

class LookupModule(LookupBase):

    def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
    
        ret = []
        for term in terms:
            var = term.split()[0]
            ret.append(os.getenv(var, ''))
    
        return ret
```
