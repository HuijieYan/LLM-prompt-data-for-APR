The issue is with the `run` method of the `env_lookup` class. It should be able to retrieve the environment variables using `os.getenv(var, '')` but it's not returning the expected values, leading to failed test cases.

The bug occurs because the `run` method is using the `os.getenv(var, '')` function, which is not the correct approach to retrieve environment variables. It should use the `os.environ.get(var, '')` function instead.

To fix the bug, the `run` method should be updated to use the correct function `os.environ.get()` to retrieve the environment variables.

Here is the corrected code for the `run` method:

```python
import os

def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
    ret = []
    for term in terms:
        ret.append(os.environ.get(term, ''))
    return ret
```
