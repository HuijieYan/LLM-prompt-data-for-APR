The problematic function 'run' is intended to retrieve the environment variables specified in the 'terms' list and return their values. However, the bug seems to be in the way the environment variable values are being retrieved and added to the 'ret' list during each iteration. The function is using the split() method, but it should be using the os.environ.get() method to retrieve the environment variable values.

The reason for the bug is that the function uses the split() method to separate the environment variable name from its value, which is unnecessary. Since the function intends to retrieve the environment variable value, it should use the os.environ.get() method.

To fix the bug, the 'run' function needs to be updated to use the os.environ.get() method to retrieve the environment variable values directly, without splitting the values into separate strings.

Here's the corrected code for the 'run' function:

```python
import os

def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
    ret = []
    for term in terms:
        ret.append(os.environ.get(term, ''))

    return ret
```
