The potential error in the provided function is the failure to fetch the environment variable values when they contain UTF-8 characters. This is because the `os.getenv` method is not suitable for handling UTF-8 characters, especially in Python 2.7.

To fix this bug, you can use the `os.environ` dictionary to get the environment variable values instead of using `os.getenv`. Then, handle the UTF-8 characters appropriately by ensuring the encoding and decoding are done correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `run` method:

```python
import os

# class declaration containing the buggy function
class LookupModule(LookupBase):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
        ret = []
        for term in terms:
            var = term.split()[0]
            value = os.environ.get(var, '')
            ret.append(value)

        return ret
```

In this corrected code, the `os.environ` dictionary is used to fetch the environment variable values, and the retrieved values are appended to the `ret` list. This should now handle UTF-8 characters correctly and address the issue mentioned in the provided test cases and error messages.
