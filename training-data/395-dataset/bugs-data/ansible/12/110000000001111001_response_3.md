The issue with the provided function is that it tries to split each term using a space and then retrieve the environment variable based on the first part of the split. However, in the buggy function, it is not actually importing the `os` module. This will result in a `NameError` when `os` is referenced.

To fix this issue, we need to import the `os` module at the beginning of the function. Then we can use the `os.getenv` function to retrieve the environment variable. If the environment variable does not exist, the function should return an empty string.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
import os

def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
    ret = []
    for term in terms:
        var = term
        ret.append(os.getenv(var, ''))

    return ret
```
