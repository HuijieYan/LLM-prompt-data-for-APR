The error is occurring because the function `run` is not importing the `os` module and it does not have access to the `os.getenv` method. As a result, it is returning an empty list for all the environment variables provided in the `terms` list.

To fix this issue, we need to import the `os` module in the `env.py` file so that the function can access the `os.getenv` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `run` function:

```python
import os  # Add this line to import the os module

def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
    ret = []
    for term in terms:
        var = term.split()[0]
        ret.append(os.getenv(var, ''))

    return ret
```

By adding the `import os` line at the beginning of the file, the `run` function will now be able to access the `os.getenv` method and retrieve the environment variables correctly.

By making this change, the `run` function will now be able to retrieve and return the expected values for the environment variables, resolving the issues seen in the test cases.
