The error in the problematic function `run` lies in the line `ret.append(os.getenv(var, ''))`. This line attempts to retrieve the environment variable's value using `os.getenv` but it doesn't seem to import the `os` module. This is causing the function to always return an empty string `''`.

To fix this bug, the `os` module needs to be imported at the beginning of the file.

Here's the corrected code for the `run` function:

```python
import os

def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
    ret = []
    for term in terms:
        var = term.split()[0]
        ret.append(os.getenv(var, ''))

    return ret
```
