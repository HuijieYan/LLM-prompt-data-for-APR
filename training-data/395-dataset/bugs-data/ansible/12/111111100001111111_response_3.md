The bug is likely occurring in the `os.getenv` function within the `run` method of the `env` lookup plugin. The issue seems to be related to UTF-8 characters not being handled properly, causing the lookup to fail when environment variable values contain such characters.

The reason behind the bug is that the `os.getenv` function may not be properly handling UTF-8 characters in the environment variable values, leading to encoding errors.

To fix this bug, it's important to ensure that the `os.getenv` function properly handles UTF-8 encoding and decoding. This may involve modifying the `run` method to explicitly handle UTF-8 encoding and decoding when retrieving environment variable values.

Corrected code:
```python
import os

class LookupModule(LookupBase):
    
    def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
        ret = []
        for term in terms:
            var = term.split()[0]
            value = os.getenv(var, '').encode('utf-8').decode('utf-8')
            ret.append(value)
    
        return ret
```
