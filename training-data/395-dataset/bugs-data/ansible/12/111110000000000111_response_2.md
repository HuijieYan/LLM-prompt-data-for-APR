The bug is occurring because the original function does not handle UTF-8 characters properly when retrieving environment variable values. This causes the function to fail when encountering UTF-8 characters in the environment variable value.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to properly handle UTF-8 characters when retrieving environment variable values.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import os

# class declaration containing the fixed function
class LookupModule(LookupBase):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the fixed function
    def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
        ret = []
        for term in terms:
            var = term.split()[0]
            ret.append(os.getenv(var, '').decode('utf-8'))

        return ret
```

In the corrected code, we use the `os.getenv` function to retrieve the environment variable value and then decode it using UTF-8 decoding to properly handle UTF-8 characters. This should resolve the issue with the environment lookup plugin failing with UTF8 characters in the variable value.
