Potential bug location: The bug is likely located in the `run` function of the `LookupModule` class. The issue seems to be with the `os.getenv` function, which is not returning the expected environment variable values.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug occurs because the `os.getenv` function is used incorrectly. It should be used to fetch the environment variable values, but the current implementation is splitting the term and attempting to fetch the value, which is not the correct usage.

Possible approaches to fix the bug:
1. Instead of splitting the term and fetching the value separately, directly fetch the environment variable value using `os.getenv`.
2. Check if the environment variable exists before fetching its value to avoid potential errors.

Corrected code for the `run` function of the `LookupModule` class:
```python
import os

class LookupModule(LookupBase):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
        ret = []
        for term in terms:
            ret.append(os.getenv(term, ''))

        return ret
```
