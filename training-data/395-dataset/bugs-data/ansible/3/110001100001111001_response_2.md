The issue with the function is that it is not handling the condition for the 'Debian' distribution_release properly. The function does not handle the case when 'distribution_release' is 'NA' properly.

The potential error location is in the 'if' condition where it checks if 'collected_facts['distribution_release'] == 'NA'. This condition is not handled properly as it should check if the value is not available.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the 'if' condition to properly handle the case when 'distribution_release' is 'NA'. We should also update the code to extract the release version in that case.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import re

def parse_distribution_file_Debian(self, name, data, path, collected_facts):
    debian_facts = {}
    if 'Debian' in data or 'Raspbian' in data:
        debian_facts['distribution'] = 'Debian'
        release = re.search(r"PRETTY_NAME=[^(]+ \(?([^)]+?)\)", data)
        if release:
            debian_facts['distribution_release'] = collected_facts['distribution_release']
            # handle the case when distribution_release is 'NA'
            if collected_facts['distribution_release'] == 'NA':
                # extract the release version from the data
                release_match = re.search(r"VERSION_ID=\"(.*)\"", data)
                if release_match:
                    debian_facts['distribution_release'] = release_match.group(1)

        # Last resort: try to find release from tzdata as either lsb is missing or this is very old debian
        if collected_facts['distribution_release'] == 'NA' and 'Debian' in data:
            dpkg_cmd = self.module.get_bin_path('dpkg')
            if dpkg_cmd:
                cmd = "%s --status tzdata|grep Provides|cut -f2 -d'-'" % dpkg_cmd
                rc, out, err = self.module.run_command(cmd)
                if rc == 0:
                    debian_facts['distribution_release'] = out.strip()
    # rest of the code remains the same

    return True, debian_facts
```
