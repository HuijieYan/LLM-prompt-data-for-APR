The bug in the code seems to be related to the `re.search` function not returning the expected results. The `re.search` function is used to extract information from the `data` string, but it is not returning the expected values in some cases. This could be due to incorrect regular expressions or incorrect extraction of groups from the match object.

To fix the bug, the regular expressions used in the `re.search` function need to be reviewed to ensure they are extracting the correct information. Additionally, the way the groups are being extracted from the match object needs to be checked to make sure the correct groups are being accessed.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
import re

def parse_distribution_file_Debian(self, name, data, path, collected_facts):
    debian_facts = {}
    if 'Debian' in data or 'Raspbian' in data:
        debian_facts['distribution'] = 'Debian'
        release = re.search(r'PRETTY_NAME="([^"]+)"', data)
        if release:
            debian_facts['distribution_release'] = release.group(1)
        # ... (other conditions and extraction logic)

    # ... (other conditions and extraction logic)
    
    return True, debian_facts
```
