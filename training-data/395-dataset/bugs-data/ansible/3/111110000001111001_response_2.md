The buggy function `parse_distribution_file_Debian` has several issues:

1. The function logic is too complex and hard to follow, making it prone to errors.
2. There are missing imports in the function (e.g., `re` is used, but not imported).
3. The function returns a boolean and a dictionary, which can be confusing for the caller.

To fix the function, it can be refactored to simplify the logic and improve readability. The import for the `re` module should also be added to the function. Additionally, the return value should be simplified to just return the dictionary of `debian_facts`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re  # Add import for the re module

# class declaration containing the buggy function
class DistributionFiles():
    """
    has-a various distro file parsers (os-release, etc) and logic for finding the right one.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def parse_distribution_file_Debian(self, name, data, path, collected_facts):
        debian_facts = {}

        if 'Debian' in data or 'Raspbian' in data:
            debian_facts['distribution'] = 'Debian'
            release_match = re.search(r"PRETTY_NAME=[^(]+ \(?([^)]+?)\)", data)
            if release_match:
                debian_facts['distribution_release'] = release_match.groups()[0]

            # Last resort: try to find release from tzdata as either lsb is missing or this is very old debian
            if collected_facts['distribution_release'] == 'NA' and 'Debian' in data:
                dpkg_cmd = self.module.get_bin_path('dpkg')
                if dpkg_cmd:
                    cmd = "%s --status tzdata|grep Provides|cut -f2 -d'-'" % dpkg_cmd
                    rc, out, err = self.module.run_command(cmd)
                    if rc == 0:
                        debian_facts['distribution_release'] = out.strip()
        
        return debian_facts
```

In this corrected version of the function, the `re` module is imported at the beginning. The function logic is simplified and the return value is only the `debian_facts` dictionary.

This should resolve the issues and make the function more readable and maintainable.
