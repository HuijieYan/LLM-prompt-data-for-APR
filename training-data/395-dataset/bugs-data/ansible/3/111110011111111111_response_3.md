The bug seems to be occurring in the comparison of the generated distribution name. The error message indicates that the expected value is "Kali" while the generated value is "Kali GNU/Linux".

This discrepancy is likely due to the fact that the function is not handling the distribution name consistently. It seems that the function is not taking into account the presence of "GNU/Linux" in the distribution name.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to handle the distribution name consistently by including "GNU/Linux" in the comparison.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def parse_distribution_file_Debian(self, name, data, path, collected_facts):
    debian_facts = {}
    if 'Debian' in data or 'Raspbian' in data:
        debian_facts['distribution'] = 'Debian GNU/Linux'
        release = re.search(r"PRETTY_NAME=[^(]+ \(?([^)]+?)\)", data)
        if release:
            debian_facts['distribution_release'] = release.groups()[0]

        # Rest of the code remains the same
        # ...

    return True, debian_facts
```
