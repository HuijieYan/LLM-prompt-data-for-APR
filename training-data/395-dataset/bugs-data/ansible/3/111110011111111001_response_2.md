The error is occurring because the test case expects the `distribution` key to have a value of "Kali", but the actual output is "Kali GNU/Linux". This discrepancy is causing the test to fail.

The potential error location within the function is the `parse_distribution_file_Debian` method, specifically in the logic related to setting the `debian_facts['distribution']` value.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not setting the `debian_facts['distribution']` value correctly. It is missing the "GNU/Linux" portion in the value.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the `debian_facts['distribution']` value includes "GNU/Linux". This can be achieved by modifying the logic related to setting this value in the function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class DistributionFiles():
    """
    has-a various distro file parsers (os-release, etc) and logic for finding the right one.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def parse_distribution_file_Debian(self, name, data, path, collected_facts):
        debian_facts = {}
        if 'Debian' in data or 'Raspbian' in data:
            debian_facts['distribution'] = 'Debian GNU/Linux'  # Fix: include "GNU/Linux" in the distribution value
            release = re.search(r"PRETTY_NAME=[^(]+ \(?([^)]+?)\)", data)
            if release:
                debian_facts['distribution_release'] = release.groups()[0]
    
            # Rest of the code...

        # Rest of the code...

        return True, debian_facts
```

By correcting the code in the `parse_distribution_file_Debian` method to include "GNU/Linux" in the `debian_facts['distribution']` value, the function should now produce the expected output and pass the test case.
