The bug seems to be in the function `parse_distribution_file_Debian` which is supposed to parse Debian distribution information but is not correctly parsing some variations such as Kali 2020.2.

It seems that the issue is related to the fact that when Kali 2020.2 is encountered, the function is returning the distribution as 'Kali GNU/Linux Rolling' instead of just 'Kali'. This is causing the assertion in the test case to fail since it expects the distribution to be 'Kali'.

To fix this bug, we can modify the condition where 'Kali' is checked and set the 'distribution' key to 'Kali' instead of the full distribution name of 'Kali GNU/Linux Rolling'.

Here is the corrected function for `parse_distribution_file_Debian`:

```python
import re

def parse_distribution_file_Debian(self, name, data, path, collected_facts):
    debian_facts = {}
    if 'Debian' in data or 'Raspbian' in data:
        debian_facts['distribution'] = 'Debian'
        release = re.search(r"PRETTY_NAME=[^(]+ \(?([^)]+?)\)", data)
        if release:
            debian_facts['distribution_release'] = release.groups()[0]
        
        # ... (other condition checks)

    elif path == '/etc/lsb-release' and 'Kali' in data:
        debian_facts['distribution'] = 'Kali'  # Corrected line
        release = re.search('DISTRIB_RELEASE=(.*)', data)
        if release:
            debian_facts['distribution_release'] = release.groups()[0]
        # ... (other condition checks)

    else:
        return False, debian_facts

    return True, debian_facts
```

With this correction, the function should correctly parse the distribution as 'Kali' when encountering 'Kali 2020.2' and pass the test case.
