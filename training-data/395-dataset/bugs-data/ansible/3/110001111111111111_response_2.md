The error is occurring in the test function where it is expecting the value of the 'distribution' variable to be 'Kali', but the actual value is 'Kali GNU/Linux'. This is causing the assertion to fail.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the 'parse_distribution_file_Debian' function. The function is not returning the correct value for the 'distribution' variable.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function 'parse_distribution_file_Debian' is not setting the 'distribution' variable correctly. It should set the 'distribution' variable to be 'Kali', but it is setting it as 'Kali GNU/Linux'.

To fix the bug, the function 'parse_distribution_file_Debian' should be modified to correctly set the 'distribution' variable to 'Kali' instead of 'Kali GNU/Linux'.

Here's the corrected code for the 'parse_distribution_file_Debian' function:

```python
import re

def parse_distribution_file_Debian(self, name, data, path, collected_facts):
    debian_facts = {}
    if 'Debian' in data or 'Raspbian' in data:
        debian_facts['distribution'] = 'Debian'
        # existing code remains unchanged
    elif 'Ubuntu' in data:
        debian_facts['distribution'] = 'Ubuntu'
        # existing code remains unchanged
    # ... (other conditions remain unchanged)
    else:
        return False, debian_facts

    return True, debian_facts
```
