The error occurs in the `test_distribution_version` function, where the test case is comparing the value of `generated_facts['distribution']` with the expected value (`val`) for the key 'distribution'. The expected value is 'Kali', but the actual value is 'Kali GNU/Linux', leading to the assertion error.

The bug in the `parse_distribution_file_Debian` function is likely to be caused by incorrect parsing of the release information from the distribution data. This results in the 'distribution' facts containing additional information ('GNU/Linux') causing the assertion error in the test case.

To fix this bug, the release information should be parsed correctly from the distribution data to ensure that the 'distribution' facts only contain the name of the distribution without any additional information.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected function
import re

def parse_distribution_file_Debian(self, name, data, path, collected_facts):
    debian_facts = {}
    
    if 'Debian' in data or 'Raspbian' in data:
        debian_facts['distribution'] = 'Debian'
        release = re.search(r"PRETTY_NAME=[^(]+ \(?([^)]+?)\)", data)
        if release:
            debian_facts['distribution_release'] = release.group(1)

    # rest of the conditions go here

    return True, debian_facts
```
