The test case "Kali 2020.2" is expecting the value "Kali" for the "distribution" key, but the actual value is "Kali GNU/Linux". This mismatch is causing the assertion error.

The potential error location within the function is likely the part where "Kali GNU/Linux" is being assigned to the "distribution" key instead of just "Kali".

The bug occurred because the function is not correctly assigning the name of the distribution. It is appending "GNU/Linux" to the distribution name, which is causing the mismatch in the test case.

To fix the bug, we can modify the code to only assign the distribution name without appending "GNU/Linux" to it.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def parse_distribution_file_Debian(self, name, data, path, collected_facts):
    debian_facts = {}
    if 'Debian' in data or 'Raspbian' in data:
        debian_facts['distribution'] = 'Debian'  # Updated assignment to remove "GNU/Linux" from the name
        release = re.search(r"PRETTY_NAME=[^(]+ \(?([^)]+?)\)", data)
        if release:
            debian_facts['distribution_release'] = release.groups()[0]

        # Rest of the code remains unchanged...

    return True, debian_facts
```
