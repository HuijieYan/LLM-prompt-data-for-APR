The error occurs because the expected value for the `distribution` key in the `generated_facts` dictionary is `'Kali'`, while the actual value is `'Kali GNU/Linux'`.

The bug in the function is due to the incorrect comparison of the `generated_facts[key]` with `val`. This causes the assertion to fail.

The bug occurs because the expected value of the `distribution` key is missing the 'GNU/Linux' suffix that is present in the actual value. This inconsistency in the comparison leads to the assertion failure.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the expected value for the `distribution` key to include the 'GNU/Linux' suffix.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected function for parsing distribution file
def parse_distribution_file_Debian(self, name, data, path, collected_facts):
    debian_facts = {}
    if 'Debian' in data or 'Raspbian' in data:
        debian_facts['distribution'] = 'Debian GNU/Linux'  # Include the 'GNU/Linux' suffix
        release = re.search(r"PRETTY_NAME=[^(]+ \(?([^)]+?)\)", data)
        if release:
            debian_facts['distribution_release'] = release.groups()[0]

        # Rest of the code remains the same
        # ...
```
