Potential error location: 
The `_load_collections` function is not handling the input parameter `ds` correctly. It is not checking if the input `ds` is a list before trying to access its elements.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: 
The bug seems to be occurring because the function is assuming `ds` to be a list without checking its type, which leads to an error when trying to access its elements.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add a check to ensure that `ds` is a list before attempting to access its elements.
2. Handle the case where `ds` is not a list and return `None`.
3. Validate the input `ds` and handle any potential errors or unexpected input values.

Corrected code:

```python
# class declaration containing the fixed function
class CollectionSearch():
    # ... omitted code ...

    # This is the fixed function
    def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
        # this will only be called if someone specified a value; call the shared value
        _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds)
    
        if not isinstance(ds, list):  # check if ds is a list
            return None  # return None if ds is not a list
    
        if not ds:  # don't return an empty collection list, just return None
            return None
    
        return ds
```
