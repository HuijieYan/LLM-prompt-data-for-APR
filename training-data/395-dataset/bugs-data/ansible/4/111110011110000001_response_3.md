The error occurs because the buggy function `_load_collections` is not correctly handling the case where `ds` is a list with a single value that is a string with a template variable (e.g., 'foo.{{bar}}'). The function should handle this case and return the list as is.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to check if the input is a list and the elements are non-empty strings. If so, the function should return the list as is; otherwise, it should return None.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
class CollectionSearch():
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
        # this will only be called if someone specified a value; call the shared value
        _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds)
    
        if not ds or not all(isinstance(elem, str) and elem for elem in ds):
            return None
    
        return ds
```

With this corrected implementation, the test case should pass without any errors.
