Potential error location: The if statement `if not ds` is causing the function to return `None` if the list `ds` is empty, which may not be the desired behavior.

Reason for the bug: The if statement `if not ds` checks if the list `ds` is empty, and if it is, it returns `None`. However, the expected behavior is to return the list `ds`, even if it is empty.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Modify the if statement to return the list `ds` if it is not empty, and remove the check for an empty list.

Corrected code:
```python
def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
    # this will only be called if someone specified a value; call the shared value
    _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds)

    return ds
```
