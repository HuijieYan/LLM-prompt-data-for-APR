The issue with the provided function is that it checks for the presence of `ds` and then returns it. If `ds` is empty, it returns `None`. However, in the buggy case, even if `ds` is not empty, it's not returning the expected value. 

The reason for the bug is that the function is not considering the case where `ds` is not empty, and instead just returns the value of `ds`.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if `ds` is not empty, and if it is not empty, then return `ds`. Otherwise, return `None`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class CollectionSearch():
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
        if ds:  # check if ds is not empty
            return ds  # return ds if it's not empty
        else:
            return None  # return None if ds is empty
```
