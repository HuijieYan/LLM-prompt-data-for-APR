Potential Error:
The potential error in the given function is that the `ds` argument is being checked against an empty value before it is being used in the `_ensure_default_collection` and the subsequent `return` statement. This is unnecessary and might cause issues if `ds` is expected to have a default value.

Reason for the Bug:
The function checks if `ds` is empty and returns `None` without considering if `ds` has a default value. This might cause unintended behavior and does not handle the default value correctly.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we can remove the check for `ds` being empty and directly call the `_ensure_default_collection` function with the `ds` argument. This will ensure that the default collection is loaded if `ds` is not specified, and then simply return the `ds` value.

Corrected Code:
```python
# class declaration containing the fixed function
class CollectionSearch():
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the fixed function
    def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
        _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds)
        return ds
```
