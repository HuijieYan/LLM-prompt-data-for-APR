## Analysis
The function `_load_collections` is responsible for loading collections, and it seems to be handling the `ds` variable incorrectly. Based on the bug report and the test case, it appears that the function is not processing the collection name properly when it contains a variable.

## Error Reason
The function `_load_collections` should handle the collection name as a string, but it's not able to process it correctly when the name contains a variable. This is likely causing the role to not be recognized as part of the collection.

## Possible Approaches
1. Check if the function is handling the dynamic collection name properly.
2. Ensure that the function can process and resolve the collection name when it includes a variable like `{{ collection_var_name }}`.

## Corrected Code
```python
def _load_collections(self, attr, ds, env=None, collection_name=None):
    _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds)

    if not ds:
        return None

    if env and collection_name:
        resolved_collection_name = env.from_string(collection_name).render()
        return [item for item in ds if item == resolved_collection_name]
    else:
        return ds
```
In the corrected code, the function now accepts `env` and `collection_name` as optional parameters. It checks if both `env` and `collection_name` are provided, and if so, it resolves the collection name using `env.from_string(collection_name).render()` and returns the matching collection. Otherwise, it returns the input `ds`. This should handle dynamic collection names properly and address the issue.
