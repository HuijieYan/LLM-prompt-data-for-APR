The error message indicates an assertion failure in the test function `test_collection_static_warning`. The specific assertion that fails is `assert '[WARNING]: "collections" is not templatable, but we found: %s' % collection_name in std_err`.

The potential error location within the `_load_collections` function is the call to `_ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds)`. This call is made without using `self` to access the function within the class instance.

The reason behind the bug is that `_ensure_default_collection` is a method of the class containing `_load_collections`, and it should be called using `self` to access it from within the class.

To fix the bug, the call to `_ensure_default_collection` should be updated to use `self` to access the method within the class.

Here's the corrected code for the `_load_collections` method:

```python
def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
    # this will only be called if someone specified a value; call the shared value
    self._ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds)

    if not ds:  # don't return an empty collection list, just return None
        return None

    return ds
```
