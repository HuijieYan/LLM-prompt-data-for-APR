Please fix the function/method provided below and provide the corrected function/method as the output.


# Buggy function source code
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/ansible_4/lib/ansible/playbook/collectionsearch.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=None):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# class declaration containing the buggy function
class CollectionSearch():
    # ... omitted code ...




    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
        # this will only be called if someone specified a value; call the shared value
        _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds)
    
        if not ds:  # don't return an empty collection list, just return None
            return None
    
        return ds
    
```

# Variable runtime value and type inside buggy function
## Buggy case 1
### input parameter runtime value and type for buggy function
ds, value: `['foo.{{bar}}']`, type: `list`

### variable runtime value and type before buggy function return
ds, value: `['foo.{{bar}}', 'ansible.legacy']`, type: `list`

env, value: `<jinja2.environment.Environment object at 0x10efb0a10>`, type: `Environment`

collection_name, value: `'ansible.legacy'`, type: `str`



# Expected variable value and type in tests
## Expected case 1
### Input parameter value and type
ds, value: `['foo.{{bar}}']`, type: `list`

### Expected variable value and type before function return
ds, expected value: `['foo.{{bar}}', 'ansible.legacy']`, type: `list`






# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
Using a variable in FQCN of the collection called inside the playbook does not find the roles
```

## The associated detailed issue description
```text
SUMMARY
While trying to include roles from collections in a dynamic manner, I used a variable as name for the collection name (eg. my_namespace.{{ collection_var_name }}.role1 ). By doing so, the role is not found. Replacing the collection_var_name with the collection name correctly i can use the role without issues.

ISSUE TYPE
Bug Report
COMPONENT NAME
Collections

ANSIBLE VERSION

ansible 2.9.6
  configured module search path = [u'/Users/alexandruvinogradov/.ansible/plugins/modules', u'/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
  ansible python module location = /Users/alexandruvinogradov/Library/Python/2.7/lib/python/site-packages/ansible
  executable location = /usr/local/bin/ansible
  python version = 2.7.16 (default, Jan 27 2020, 04:46:15) [GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 10.0.1 (clang-1001.0.37.14)]

CONFIGURATION
no modification
OS / ENVIRONMENT
MacOS Mojave 10.14.6

STEPS TO REPRODUCE
Use the playbook below to try to execute role1 from a pre-created collection. Call the collection by passing the var collection_name to match the collection name.
ansible-playbook playbook.yml -e'{"collection_name":"name"}'

---
- hosts: all  
  collections:
   - namespace.{{ collection_name }}
  tasks:
    - import_role:
        name: role1
EXPECTED RESULTS
The expected behaviour would be that the role from the collection passed as variable gets executed. If i were to replace the variable in the playbook with the actual passed name, the role gets executed correctly.

ACTUAL RESULTS
The role is not recognized as part of the collection.

ERROR! the role 'role1' was not found

The error appears to be in 'playbook.yml': line 7, column 15, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:

    - import_role:
        name: role1
              ^ here
```
