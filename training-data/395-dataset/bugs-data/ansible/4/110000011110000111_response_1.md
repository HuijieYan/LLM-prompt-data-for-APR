The error occurs when trying to use a variable as the name for a collection in a playbook. The error message mentions that the role 'role1' was not found, indicating that the variable collection name is not being resolved correctly.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the _load_collections method, specifically in the line where it checks for the presence of a collection name. It seems that the function is not handling the variable collection name correctly, which leads to the role not being found.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the _load_collections method is not properly handling the case where a variable is used as the collection name. This results in the collection not being resolved correctly when used in a playbook.

To fix the bug, the _load_collections method should be modified to properly handle cases where a variable is used as the collection name. It should ensure that the variable collection name is properly resolved before returning the collection list.

Here's the corrected code for the _load_collections method:

```python
def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
    # this will only be called if someone specified a value; call the shared value
    _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds)

    if not ds:  # don't return an empty collection list, just return None
        return None
    
    return [attr]  # assuming attr is the variable collection name
```
