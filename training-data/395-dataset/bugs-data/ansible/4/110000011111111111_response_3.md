The issue seems to be related to a variable name 'collection_name' not being properly substituted in the playbook when loading the collections. 

The `_load_collections` function checks if the input list is empty and returns `None` if it is. However, in this case, the input list is not empty, but it might not be processing the Jinja template syntax properly.

The potential error location is within the `_load_collections` function, specifically where it checks if `ds` is not empty and should return it. 

The bug occurs because the function is not properly processing the Jinja template syntax in the input list `ds`. 

To fix the bug, the function should process the Jinja template syntax using the provided `jinja2.Environment` object before returning the `ds`. This can be done by iterating through the input list `ds` and rendering each item using the `jinja2.Environment` object.

Here's the corrected code for the `_load_collections` function:

```python
def _load_collections(self, attr, ds, env):
    # this will only be called if someone specified a value; call the shared value
    _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds)

    if not ds:  # don't return an empty collection list, just return None
        return None

    rendered_ds = [env.from_string(item).render() for item in ds]
    return rendered_ds
```

Additionally, the test function should provide the `jinja2.Environment` object as an input when calling the `_load_collections` function in order to properly process the Jinja templates.
