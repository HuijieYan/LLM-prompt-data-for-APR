The issue appears to be related to using a variable as the name for the collection in the playbook. It seems that this causes the role to not be found when trying to execute it. 

The error likely occurs in the `_load_collections` function, specifically in the call to `_ensure_default_collection` where the `collection_list` parameter is set to `ds`.

The reason behind the bug is that when using a variable as the collection name, it is not being properly resolved in the `_ensure_default_collection` function. This may be due to the way the variable is being passed or used within the function.

To fix this bug, the `collection_list` parameter in the call to `_ensure_default_collection` needs to be replaced with the actual collection name rather than the variable `ds`.

Here is the corrected code for the `_load_collections` function:

```python
def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
    # this will only be called if someone specified a value; call the shared value
    _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=attr)
    
    if not ds:  # don't return an empty collection list, just return None
        return None
    
    return ds
```

In this corrected code, the `collection_list` parameter is replaced with the actual collection name `attr`, which should resolve the issue of using a variable as the collection name.
