Potential error location: 
The potential error is in the condition `if not ds`, which is checking if the value of `ds` is falsy. This could be problematic because it could incorrectly return `None` when `ds` is an empty collection instead of a falsy value.

Reason for the bug:
The condition `if not ds` will return `True` if `ds` is an empty collection, causing the function to return `None` when it should return the empty collection.

Approach to fix the bug:
Instead of checking if `ds` is falsy, use a specific check to determine if `ds` is an empty collection and return it, rather than returning `None`.

Corrected code:

```python
def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
    # this will only be called if someone specified a value; call the shared value
    _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds)

    if not ds:  # use a specific check for an empty collection
        return []
    
    return ds
```
