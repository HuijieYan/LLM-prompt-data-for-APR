The bug is likely occurring in the `_load_collections` method where the `_ensure_default_collection` function is called. The issue seems to be related to the usage of variables in the collection name, as described in the GitHub issue.

The bug occurs because when a variable is used in the collection name, it is not being evaluated properly before being passed to the `_ensure_default_collection` function. This results in the collection not being found when trying to import a role from it.

To fix the bug, the variable should be properly evaluated before being passed to the `_ensure_default_collection` function. This can be achieved by using Jinja2's environment to render the variable value, especially if the collection name contains Jinja2 variables.

Here's the corrected code for the `_load_collections` method:

```python
from jinja2 import Environment

# ... (other code) ...

class SomeClass:
    # ... (other methods) ...

    def _load_collections(self, attr, ds, env, collection_name):
        # this will only be called if someone specified a value; call the shared value
        collection_list = env.from_string(collection_name).render()
        _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=collection_list)
    
        if not ds:  # don't return an empty collection list, just return None
            return None
    
        return ds
```

In this corrected code, we are using the `env` parameter, which seems to be an instance of Jinja2's environment as per the given test case. We are rendering the `collection_name` variable using Jinja2's environment before passing it to the `_ensure_default_collection` function. This should ensure that the collection name is properly evaluated before its usage.
