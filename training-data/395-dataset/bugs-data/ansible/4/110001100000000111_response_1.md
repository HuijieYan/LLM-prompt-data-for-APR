Potential error location:
The issue seems to be related to the dynamic nature of the collection name not being properly handled in the code. Specifically, the `_load_collections` method is not correctly handling the dynamic collection name.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `_load_collections` method is not taking into account the dynamic nature of the collection name. It seems to be assuming a static collection name, which causes the role to not be found when using a variable as part of the collection name.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `_load_collections` method to properly handle the dynamic collection name by evaluating the variable and substituting it with the actual collection name.
2. Ensure that the `_ensure_default_collection` method is properly handling the collection list and is able to handle dynamic collection names.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# relative function's signature in this file
def _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=None):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
    if collection_list is not None:
        _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=collection_list)
    
    if not ds:  # don't return an empty collection list, just return None
        return None

    return ds
```
