SUMMARY
While trying to include roles from collections in a dynamic manner, I used a variable as name for the collection name (eg. my_namespace.{{ collection_var_name }}.role1 ). By doing so, the role is not found. Replacing the collection_var_name with the collection name correctly i can use the role without issues.

ANSIBLE VERSION

ansible 2.9.6
  configured module search path = [u'/Users/alexandruvinogradov/.ansible/plugins/modules', u'/usr/share/ansible/plugins/modules']
  ansible python module location = /Users/alexandruvinogradov/Library/Python/2.7/lib/python/site-packages/ansible

  python version = 2.7.16 (default, Jan 27 2020, 04:46:15) [GCC 4.2.1 Compatible Apple LLVM 10.0.1 (clang-1001.0.37.14)]

CONFIGURATION

OS / ENVIRONMENT
MacOS Mojave 10.14.6

STEPS TO REPRODUCE
Use the playbook below to try to execute role1 from a pre-created collection. Call the collection by passing the var collection_name to match the collection name.
ansible-playbook playbook.yml -e'{"collection_name":"name"}'

---
- hosts: all  
  collections:
   - namespace.{{ collection_name }}
  tasks:
    - import_role:
        name: role1
EXPECTED RESULTS
The expected behaviour would be that the role from the collection passed as variable gets executed. If i were to replace the variable in the playbook with the actual passed name, the role gets executed correctly.

ACTUAL RESULTS
The role is not recognized as part of the collection.

ERROR! the role 'role1' was not found

The error appears to be in 'playbook.yml': line 7, column 15, but may
be elsewhere in the file depending on the exact syntax problem.

The offending line appears to be:

    - import_role:
        name: role1
              ^ here
```
