Potential error location:
The issue may be with the `_ensure_default_collection` function. It seems that it's not handling the Jinja2 variable `{{bar}}` properly, which is causing the problem when trying to load the collection.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The function `_ensure_default_collection` is not handling the Jinja2 variable `{{bar}}` properly, which is causing the issue when trying to load the collection. This is likely causing the role to not be recognized as part of the collection.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `_ensure_default_collection` function to handle Jinja2 variables properly.
2. Ensure that the collection name is being resolved correctly before attempting to load the collection.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
    if ds is not None:
        collection_list = [item.resolve() for item in ds]
        _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=collection_list)
    else:
        return None
    return ds
```

In this corrected code, the function `_load_collections` now checks if `ds` is not None and then resolves any Jinja2 variables before calling `_ensure_default_collection`. This should fix the issue with loading the collection and resolving the roles properly.
