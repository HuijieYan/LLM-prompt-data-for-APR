The issue arises from the fact that the `_load_collections` function is not correctly handling templated collection names. When a collection name includes a variable, e.g., `'foo.{{bar}}'`, the `_load_collections` function doesn't correctly handle this and fails to load the collection with the templated name.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_load_collections` function to correctly handle templated collection names. When the collection names contain variables, the function should use the environment to render the template and then load the collection with the resolved name.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
    # this will only be called if someone specified a value; call the shared value
    _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds)

    if not ds:  # don't return an empty collection list, just return None
        return None

    # Resolve any template variables in the collection names
    resolved_collections = []
    for collection_name in ds:
        resolved_collections.append(env.from_string(collection_name).render())
    
    return resolved_collections
```

In this corrected function, we first ensure the default collection by calling `_ensure_default_collection` as before. We then iterate through the provided collection names (`ds`), use Jinja `env` to resolve any template variables, and store the resolved collection names in the `resolved_collections` list. Finally, we return the list of resolved collection names.
