```python
# class declaration containing the fixed function
class CollectionSearch():
    # ... omitted code ...


    # this is the fixed function
    def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
        # this will only be called if someone specified a value; call the shared value
        _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds)  # assuming _ensure_default_collection is defined elsewhere
    
        if not ds:  # don't return an empty collection list, just return None
            return None
    
        return [ds]  # return ds as a list

```
The fixed function will now return the `ds` input as a list, which is consistent with the test function that expects the collection name to be in the list.
