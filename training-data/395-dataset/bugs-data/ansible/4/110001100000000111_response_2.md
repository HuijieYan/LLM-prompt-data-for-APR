The potential error location within the problematic function is the `_load_collections` method. The error is likely occurring because the input `ds` (which presumably stands for `default_collection` or something similar) is not being handled correctly. The function then checks if `ds` is empty and returns None, but the handling of `ds` before that in the function is unclear. It seems that `ds` should be set to some default value if it is None, and this is likely where the bug lies.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `ds` has a default value if it is None, and then return it at the end of the function. Additionally, we need to call the `_ensure_default_collection` method correctly within the function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _load_collections(self, attr, ds=None):
    if ds is None:
        # set ds to a default value
        ds = # (some default value)

    _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds)

    return ds
```
