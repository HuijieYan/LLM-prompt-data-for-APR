Potential error location: The potential error in the code is with the condition `if not ds`. This condition will return True for any empty or falsy value in `ds`, which includes empty lists, empty strings, None, etc. This may not be the intended behavior.

Reason for the bug: The function is incorrectly returning `None` if `ds` is empty, which may not be the desired behavior. It should return `ds` regardless of its content, unless `ds` is explicitly set to `None`.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Change the condition to explicitly check if `ds` is `None` and return None in that case, otherwise return `ds`.


The corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
    # this will only be called if someone specified a value; call the shared value
    _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds)

    if ds is None:  # check if ds is explicitly set to None
        return None

    return ds
```
