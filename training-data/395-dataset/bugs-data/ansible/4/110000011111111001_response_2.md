The issue with the provided code is that the _load_collections function is not handling the case where the 'collection_name' is a templated string. This is causing the test to fail and raise an assertion error.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the _load_collections function to render the 'collection_list' using the Jinja2 environment before returning it. This will ensure that any templated values are resolved before being returned. 

Here's the corrected code for the _load_collections function:

```python
from jinja2 import Template

def _load_collections(self, attr, ds, env=None):
    # this will only be called if someone specified a value; call the shared value
    _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds)

    if not ds:  # don't return an empty collection list, just return None
        return None

    if env:
        rendered_collections = [Template(item).render() for item in ds]
        return rendered_collections
    else:
        return ds
```

This updated function takes an additional parameter 'env' which represents the Jinja2 environment. If 'env' is provided, it renders each item in the 'collection_list' using the Jinja2 Template before returning the rendered collection. If 'env' is not provided, it simply returns the original 'collection_list'. This allows the function to handle both templated and non-templated collection names.
