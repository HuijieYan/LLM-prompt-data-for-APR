The test case is checking if the warning message is correctly generated when the collection name is not templatable. The test is failing because the message is not being printed to `std_err` as expected.

The potential error location within the `_load_collections` function is the call to the `_ensure_default_collection` function. This function is called with a keyword argument `collection_list=ds`, but the `ds` variable might not have been set, which is causing an issue.

The bug occurs because `ds` is being checked for truthiness with `if not ds`, and if it's not set, the function returns `None`. The `_ensure_default_collection` function is then called with `collection_list=None`, which is not the intended behavior.

To fix the bug, we should make sure that the `ds` variable is always set before calling `_ensure_default_collection`, and then modify the function logic accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
    if ds is None:  # Check if ds is None instead of truthiness check
        ds = []  # Set ds to an empty list if it's None
    
    _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds)  # Call _ensure_default_collection with the correct value
    
    return ds  # Return ds after ensuring default collection
```
