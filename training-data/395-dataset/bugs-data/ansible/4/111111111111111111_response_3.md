The error is caused by using a variable as the collection name, but the function `_load_collections()` does not handle templated collection names correctly and does not raise a warning.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `_load_collections()` function to properly handle templated collection names and raise a warning if a templated collection name is detected.

Here is the corrected code for the `_load_collections()` function:

```python
def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
    # Ensure default collection is loaded
    default_collection = []
    _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=default_collection)

    if not ds:  # don't return an empty collection list, just return None
        return None

    if any('{{' in collection for collection in ds) or any('}}' in collection for collection in ds):
        import warnings
        warnings.warn('[WARNING]: "collections" is not templatable, but we found: %s' % ds, UserWarning)

    return ds
```

With this modification, the function will check if any of the collection names contain '{{' or '}}' and raise a warning if detected.

This fixed implementation will address the issue of using a variable in the fully qualified collection name (FQCN) and handle templated collection names.
