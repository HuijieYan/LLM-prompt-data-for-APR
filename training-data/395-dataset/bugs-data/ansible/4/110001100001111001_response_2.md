Potential error location: 
The issue is likely with the line `_ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds)`, where the `collection_list` parameter is being passed as `ds`. Since `ds` is a list, this should not be the correct way to pass the value.

Reasons for the bug:
The `collection_list` parameter is being incorrectly passed as `ds`, which is a list. This is likely causing the function to not work as intended.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Change the `collection_list` parameter to accept a list of collections instead of a single collection. This will allow for the correct behavior when passing the `ds` list.
2. Iterate through the list of collections in `ds` and call `_ensure_default_collection` for each collection.

Here's the corrected code:
```python
def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
    # this will only be called if someone specified a value; call the shared value
    for collection in ds:
        _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=[collection])
    
    if not ds:  # don't return an empty collection list, just return None
        return None

    return ds
```
