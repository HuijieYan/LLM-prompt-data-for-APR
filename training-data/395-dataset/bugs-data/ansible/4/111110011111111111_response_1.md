The provided error message suggests that there is an issue with the test case `test_collection_static_warning`. Specifically, the test is failing at the assert statement where it is checking for the presence of a warning message related to the templating of the collection name.

The potential error location within the `CollectionSearch` class is the `_load_collections` method. The method is not handling the templated collection names correctly, which is causing the test failure.

The bug occurred because the `_load_collections` method did not handle the templated collection names properly. When a collection name contains a template variable, the method should ensure that it is resolved before checking for its presence in the collection list.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_load_collections` method to handle templated collection names correctly. This involves resolving the template variable using the provided `jinja2.environment.Environment` object and then checking for the presence of the resolved collection name in the collection list.

Here's the corrected code for the `_load_collections` method:

```python
import jinja2

class CollectionSearch():
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _load_collections(self, attr, ds, env, collection_name):
        _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds)

        if not ds:  # don't return an empty collection list, just return None
            return None
        
        # Resolve the template variable in the collection name
        template = env.from_string(collection_name)
        resolved_collection_name = template.render()

        if resolved_collection_name in ds:
            return ds
        else:
            return None
```

In this corrected code, the `jinja2.environment.Environment` object `env` and the `collection_name` are passed as parameters to the `_load_collections` method. The method uses the `env` to render the `collection_name` and then checks for the presence of the resolved name in the collection list `ds`. If the resolved name is found, the method returns the collection list, otherwise it returns None.

By making these changes, the method will handle templated collection names correctly and the test case should pass as expected.
