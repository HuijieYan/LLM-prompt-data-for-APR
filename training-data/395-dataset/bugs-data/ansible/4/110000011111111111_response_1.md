The problem is with the `_load_collections` function. The issue arises from the fact that the function is only returning the input collection if it's not empty. However, in the test case `collection_name` used within the `test_collection_static_warning` function is `'foo.{{bar}}'`, which is a templated value. Currently, the function isn't handling templated values properly, resulting in an incorrect behavior.

To fix this issue, we need to make sure that the function accounts for templated values and properly evaluates them before returning the collection list.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _load_collections(self, attr, ds, env=None):
    # this will only be called if someone specified a value; call the shared value
    _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds)

    if not ds:  # Don't return an empty collection list, just return None
        return None
    
    # If env is provided, evaluate any templated values in the ds list
    if env:
        ds = [env.from_string(item).render() for item in ds]

    return ds
```

With this corrected function, we explicitly check for the templated values and use the provided Jinja2 environment (if available) to render those values before returning the collection list. This should ensure that the function handles templated values properly, fixing the bug.
