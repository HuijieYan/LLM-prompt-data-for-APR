The error in the provided function `_load_collections` is that it does not handle templated collection names correctly. The error message from the test function indicates that there is a problem with the templated collection name.

The error occurs because the function `_load_collections` does not handle templated collection names properly. When the collection name is templated, it is not resolved correctly, leading to the error message in the test function.

To fix this bug, the function `_load_collections` needs to properly handle templated collection names. This can be achieved by using Ansible's templating engine to render the collection name before attempting to load it.

Here's the corrected function with the fix:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class CollectionSearch():
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
        from ansible.parsing.dataloader import DataLoader
        from ansible.template import Templar

        loader = DataLoader()
        templar = Templar(loader)

        ds = templar.template(ds)  # Render the collection name

        _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds)

        if not ds:  # don't return an empty collection list, just return None
            return None

        return ds
```

By using the Ansible templating engine to render the collection name, the corrected function now properly handles templated collection names. This should fix the issue with using a variable in the Fully Qualified Collection Name (FQCN).
