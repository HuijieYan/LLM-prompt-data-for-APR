The bug seems to be related to the usage of a variable as the name of the collection in the playbook and not being able to find the roles within that collection. The issue seems to be in the `_load_collections` method of the `CollectionSearch` class.

The problematic part in the `_load_collections` method is the call to the `_ensure_default_collection` method. The `collection_list` parameter is being passed as `ds`, which appears to be a variable that may or may not contain the name of the collection. This could be causing the method to not work as intended when trying to load the collections.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_load_collections` method to properly handle the loading of collections and make sure that the collection name is being passed correctly.

Here is the corrected code for the `_load_collections` method:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class CollectionSearch():
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
        if ds:  # check if the collection name is provided
            _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds)  # call the method with the collection name
        else:
            return None  # if the collection name is not provided, return None

        return ds
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the collection name is provided (not empty). If it is, then we call the `_ensure_default_collection` method with the collection name. If the collection name is not provided, we return `None`. This should ensure that the collections are loaded correctly and address the issue of not being able to find the roles within the collection.
