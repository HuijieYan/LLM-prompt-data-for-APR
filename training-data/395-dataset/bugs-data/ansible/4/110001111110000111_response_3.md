The error occurs in the `_load_collections` method of the `CollectionSearch` class. The error message from the test function is related to the testing of this method, which checks whether a warning message is displayed when a collection name is not templated.

The bug is caused by the incorrect use of the private method `_ensure_default_collection` within the `_load_collections` method. The method `_ensure_default_collection` is used without properly referencing it using `self`, however, by analyzing the code it appears that it's meant to be a private method of the same class `CollectionSearch`. 

To fix this bug, the method `_ensure_default_collection` should be invoked using `self._ensure_default_collection()` instead of directly calling it.

Here is the corrected code for the `_load_collections` method:

```python
def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
    self._ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds)
    
    if not ds:  # don't return an empty collection list, just return None
        return None

    return ds
```
