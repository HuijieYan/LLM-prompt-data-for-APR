The error occurs because the `_load_collections` function doesn't correctly handle the `collection_list` parameter when it contains a templated value. The function should check if the collection name is templated and, if it is, handle it appropriately.

The potential error location is within the `_load_collections` function, specifically in the logic that handles the `collection_list` parameter.

The bug occurs because the function doesn't check for templated values in the `collection_list` parameter. When the collection name is templated, it should not just return the `collection_list` as is, but instead, it should use the `jinja2` environment to render the templated value and add it to the collection list.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_load_collections` function to check if the collection name is templated. If it is, we should render the templated value using the provided `jinja2` environment and then add it to the collection list before returning it.

Here's the corrected code for the `_load_collections` function:

```python
def _load_collections(self, attr, ds, env):
    # this will only be called if someone specified a value; call the shared value
    _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds)

    if not ds:  # don't return an empty collection list, just return None
        return None

    # Check if the collection name is templated
    templated_collection_names = [c for c in ds if '{{' in c and '}}' in c]

    # If there are templated collection names, render the templates using the provided environment
    if templated_collection_names:
        rendered_collections = [env.from_string(c).render() for c in templated_collection_names]
        ds.extend(rendered_collections)

    return ds
```
