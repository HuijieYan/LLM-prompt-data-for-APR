The issue seems to be related to using a variable in the collection name, which is then not recognized when trying to load roles from the collection.

The potential error location is within the `_load_collections` method, specifically in the call to `_ensure_default_collection()`.

The bug occurs because the `_ensure_default_collection` function is called with the `collection_list` parameter set to the input `ds` without evaluating it first. This means that any variables inside `ds` are not being properly substituted before being used as the collection name. This leads to the role not being found when trying to import it.

To fix the bug, the `ds` input list should be evaluated and any variables inside its strings should be substituted before passing it to `_ensure_default_collection()`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_load_collections` method:
```python
def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
    # evaluate ds to replace any variables
    evaluated_ds = [self.env.from_string(item).render() for item in ds]  # evaluate each item in the list
    
    _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=evaluated_ds)
    
    if not ds:  # don't return an empty collection list, just return None
        return None
    
    return ds
```
This code evaluates each item in the `ds` list using the Jinja2 environment, rendering any variables inside the strings. The evaluated list is then passed to the `_ensure_default_collection()` function.
