The test case "test_collection_static_warning" is trying to test if the "_load_collections" function is correctly handling a collection that includes a template variable "{{bar}}". The test expects a warning to be printed to stderr as a result of this collection containing a templated value.

The error message indicates that the test is failing because the expected warning message is not found in the standard error output.

The potential error in the "_load_collections" function is that it's not checking for templated collection names and issuing a warning as expected by the test case.

The bug is occurring because the function is not checking for templated collection names and issuing a warning message if found.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the "_load_collections" function to check for templated collection names and print a warning message if found. 

Here's the corrected code for the "_load_collections" function:

```python
def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
    # this will only be called if someone specified a value; call the shared value
    _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds)

    if not ds:  # don't return an empty collection list, just return None
        return None

    for collection in ds:
        if '{{' in collection and '}}' in collection:
            print('[WARNING]: "collections" is not templatable, but we found: %s' % collection, file=sys.stderr)
    
    return ds
```

This updated function now checks each collection for the presence of template variables and prints a warning message to stderr if found.
