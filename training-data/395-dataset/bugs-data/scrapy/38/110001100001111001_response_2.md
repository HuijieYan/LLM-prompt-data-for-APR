Potential Error Location:
In the condition `if not clickables:`, it is expected that if there are no clickable elements found, an empty list should be returned. However, the current code has a return statement with no value, which might be causing unexpected behavior.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the return statement in the condition `if not clickables:` does not return anything when there are no clickable elements found. This can lead to unintended behavior or errors in the calling code.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to make sure that when there are no clickable elements found, we return an empty list as expected. This will ensure that the calling code handles the absence of clickable elements appropriately.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _get_clickable(clickdata, form):
    """
    Returns the clickable element specified in clickdata,
    if the latter is given. If not, it returns the first
    clickable element found
    """
    clickables = [
        el for el in form.xpath(
            'descendant::*[(self::input or self::button)'
            ' and re:test(@type, "^submit$", "i")]'
            '|descendant::button[not(@type)]',
            namespaces={"re": "http://exslt.org/regular-expressions"})
    ]

    # If we don't have clickables, we just return an empty list
    if not clickables:
        return []

    # Other logic remains the same
    # ...
    # ...
```
