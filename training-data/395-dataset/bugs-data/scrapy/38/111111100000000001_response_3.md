The error in the function `_get_clickable` lies in the line `el = form.xpath(xpath)` where it is trying to extract a clickable element using XPath. The problem is that the XPath expression is not constructed properly because there is an incorrect usage of the u'' prefix and also the iteration over items needs to be rectified.

The reason behind the bug is that the XPath expression is not being built correctly and hence it fails to retrieve the clickable element.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to construct the XPath expression using string concatenation and also properly iterate over the items to form the correct expression.


```python
import six

def _get_clickable(clickdata, form):
    """
    Returns the clickable element specified in clickdata,
    if the latter is given. If not, it returns the first
    clickable element found
    """
    clickables = [
        el for el in form.xpath(
            'descendant::*[(self::input or self::button)'
            ' and re:test(@type, "^submit$", "i")]'
            '|descendant::button[not(@type)]',
            namespaces={"re": "http://exslt.org/regular-expressions"})
        ]
    if not clickables:
        return

    # If we don't have clickdata, we just use the first clickable element
    if clickdata is None:
        el = clickables[0]
        return (el.get('name'), el.get('value') or '')

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged

    # Construct the XPath expression
    xpath = u'.//*'
    for key, value in clickdata.items():
        xpath += '[{}="{}"]'.format(key, value)

    el = form.xpath(xpath)
    if len(el) == 1:
        return (el[0].get('name'), el[0].get('value') or '')
    elif len(el) > 1:
        raise ValueError("Multiple elements found (%r) matching the criteria "
                         "in clickdata: %r" % (el, clickdata))
    else:
        raise ValueError('No clickable element matching clickdata: %r' % (clickdata,))
```
In the corrected code, the XPath expression is now constructed using string concatenation and the iteration over items is done properly to form the correct expression.
