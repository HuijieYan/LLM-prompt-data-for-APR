Potential error location: The issue seems to be occurring in the part of the code where it tries to access the first clickable element from the list "clickables" and return its name and value.

Reason for the bug: The bug seems to be occurring because the code is not handling the case where there are no clickable elements found, leading to an IndexError when trying to access the first element in the list.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add a check to see if the list "clickables" is empty, and if so, return an appropriate value or handle the case accordingly.
2. Handle the IndexError when trying to access the first element in the list to prevent the code from crashing.

Corrected code:

```python
def _get_clickable(clickdata, form):
    clickables = [
        el for el in form.xpath(
            'descendant::*[(self::input or self::button)'
            ' and re:test(@type, "^submit$", "i")]'
            '|descendant::button[not(@type)]',
            namespaces={"re": "http://exslt.org/regular-expressions"})
        ]
    if not clickables:
        return  # or handle the case appropriately

    if clickdata is None:
        el = clickables[0]
        return (el.get('name'), el.get('value') or '')

    nr = clickdata.get('nr', None)
    if nr is not None:
        try:
            el = list(form.inputs)[nr]
        except IndexError:
            pass
        else:
            return (el.get('name'), el.get('value') or '')

    xpath = u'.//*' + \
            u''.join(u'[@%s="%s"]' % c for c in six.iteritems(clickdata))
    el = form.xpath(xpath)
    if el:
        return (el[0].get('name'), el[0].get('value') or '')
    else:
        return  # or handle the case appropriately
```
