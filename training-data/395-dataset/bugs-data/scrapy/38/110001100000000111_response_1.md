Potential error location: The problem seems to be in the section that handles the clickdata to find the clickable element. The code does not seem to handle input[type=image] elements.

Reasons behind the bug: The function is not properly handling the input[type=image] elements, which are valid clickable elements in HTML forms. This is causing the function to ignore them and not consider them as clickable elements.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: The function should be modified to properly handle input[type=image] elements as clickable elements.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_clickable(clickdata, form):
    """
    Returns the clickable element specified in clickdata,
    if the latter is given. If not, it returns the first
    clickable element found
    """
    clickables = [
        el for el in form.xpath(
            'descendant::*[(self::input or self::button or self::img)'  # Modified to include input[type=image]
            ' and re:test(@type, "^submit$|^image$", "i")]'  # Modified to include image type
            '|descendant::button[not(@type)]',
            namespaces={"re": "http://exslt.org/regular-expressions"})
        ]
    if not clickables:
        return

    # If we don't have clickdata, we just use the first clickable element
    if clickdata is None:
        el = clickables[0]
        return (el.get('name'), el.get('value') or '')

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```
With this correction, the function should now properly handle input[type=image] elements as clickable elements in HTML forms.
