1. The test case `test_from_response_clickdata_does_not_ignore_image` is checking if the FormRequest ignores the `input[type=image]` element when creating the request. The expected result is a dictionary containing the name-value pairs of the form fields. The error message indicates that the `input[type=image]` element is being ignored, leading to a mismatch in the expected and actual result.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the code that selects clickable elements in the form. There might be an issue with the XPath expression used to identify clickable elements, potentially excluding `input[type=image]` elements.

3. The bug occurs because the XPath expression used in the `_get_clickable` function does not include `input[type=image]` when selecting clickable elements in the form. As a result, the `input[type=image]` element is ignored when choosing clickable elements, leading to mismatches in the output of the test case.

4. To fix the bug, the XPath expression used for selecting clickable elements should be modified to include `input[type=image]`. Additionally, the comparison of the expected and actual results should be adjusted to account for the presence of `input[type=image]` elements in the form.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_get_clickable` function:

```python
def _get_clickable(clickdata, form):
    clickables = [
        el for el in form.xpath(
            'descendant::*[(self::input or self::button or self::image)'
            ' and (re:test(@type, "^submit$", "i") or self::image)]'
            '|descendant::button[not(@type)]',
            namespaces={"re": "http://exslt.org/regular-expressions"})
        ]
    if not clickables:
        return

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
    # ...
```

The corrected code includes `self::image` within the XPath expression to ensure that `input[type=image]` elements are also included when selecting clickable elements.

With this correction, the `_get_clickable` function should now properly handle `input[type=image]` elements, resolving the bug.
