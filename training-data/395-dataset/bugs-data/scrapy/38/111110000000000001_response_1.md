Potential Error Location: 
The potential error is occurring in the line where the XPath expression is being built using the clickdata arguments. It seems that the XPath expression is not being constructed correctly, resulting in incorrect matching of clickable elements.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug is occurring because the XPath expression is not being built correctly from the clickdata arguments. This may be due to incorrect concatenation of XPath expressions or improper formatting of the clickdata arguments.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the formatting and concatenation of the XPath expression to ensure it is being constructed properly.
2. Verify that the clickdata arguments are being used correctly to build the XPath expression.
3. Test the function with different clickdata arguments to identify the specific issue with constructing the XPath expression.

Corrected Code:
```python
import six

def _get_clickable(clickdata, form):
    """
    Returns the clickable element specified in clickdata,
    if the latter is given. If not, it returns the first
    clickable element found
    """
    clickables = form.xpath(
        'descendant::*[(self::input or self::button) and (@type="submit" or not(@type))]'
    )
    
    if not clickables:
        return None

    # If we don't have clickdata, we just use the first clickable element
    if clickdata is None:
        el = clickables[0]
        return (el.get('name'), el.get('value') or '')

    # If clickdata is given, we compare it to the clickable elements to find a
    # match.
    for el in clickables:
        if all(el.attrib.get(k) == v for k, v in six.iteritems(clickdata)):
            return (el.get('name'), el.get('value') or '')

    raise ValueError('No clickable element matching clickdata: %r' % (clickdata,))
