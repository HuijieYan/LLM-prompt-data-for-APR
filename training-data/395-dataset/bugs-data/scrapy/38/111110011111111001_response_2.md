The test case `test_from_response_clickdata_does_not_ignore_image` attempts to build a response with a form and then create a request from it. The form has two input elements: one of type "text" with name "i1" and value "i1v", and the other of type "image" with name "i2" and value "i2v". The expected result is a dictionary with these input elements and their respective values.

The error message indicates that the actual result does not match the expected result. The expected result is `{'i1': [b'i1v'], 'i2': [b'i2v']}`, but the actual result is `{'i1': [b'i1v']}`.

Upon inspecting the provided code, the `_get_clickable` function is identified as the potential source of the issue. The function aims to return the clickable element specified in `clickdata` or, if not given, the first clickable element found.

The issue arises from the implementation of the `_get_clickable` function. When clickdata is None, the first clickable element from the `clickables` list is returned. However, in the given context, there is only one clickable element, and an empty list should be returned instead of selecting the first element.

To fix the bug, the logic for returning the clickable element when clickdata is None should explicitly check for the presence of elements in `clickables` and return an empty list if no elements are found.

Corrected function:

```python
def _get_clickable(clickdata, form):
    """
    Returns the clickable element specified in clickdata,
    if the latter is given. If not, it returns the first
    clickable element found
    """
    clickables = [
        el for el in form.xpath(
            'descendant::*[(self::input or self::button)'
            ' and re:test(@type, "^submit$", "i")]'
            '|descendant::button[not(@type)]',
            namespaces={"re": "http://exslt.org/regular-expressions"})
    ]
    if not clickables:
        return []

    if clickdata is None:
        return []

    # ... (rest of the logic remains unchanged)
```

By explicitly returning an empty list when clickdata is None, the function ensures that the correct result is returned in the given context.
