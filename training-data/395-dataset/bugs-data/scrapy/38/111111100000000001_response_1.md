Potential error location: The code is trying to return the clickable element specified in clickdata, but there are several conditional checks and XPath operations which could potentially lead to issues.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The code does not handle the case where the XPath operation returns no elements.
2. There are multiple conditional checks and different XPath operations, which could make the code difficult to follow and debug.
3. The code includes multiple return statements, making it hard to understand the flow of the function.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the XPath operation returns at least one element, and handle the case where it does not.
2. Simplify the conditional checks and operations to make the code more readable and easier to maintain.
3. Consider refactoring the function to have a single return statement, which also makes it easier to understand the flow of the function.

Corrected code:
