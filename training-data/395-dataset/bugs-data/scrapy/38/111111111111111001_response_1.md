The provided code contains a function named _get_clickable that seems to be part of a web scraping framework. The function is responsible for identifying clickable elements in a web form.

Based on the provided test case, it seems that the function is not handling the clickables correctly, resulting in a failure in the test case. The comparison made in the test case is failing because the expected form data (`{b'i1': [b'i1v'], b'i2': [b'i2v']}`) is not being generated properly.

Upon analyzing the function, the issue seems to be related to the generation of clickables and the subsequent extraction of element attributes. The "el.get('name')" and "el.get('value')" calls do not seem to extract the correct values based on the input.

The potential reasons for the bug could be:
1. Incorrect extraction of element attributes from the clickable elements.
2. Incorrect identification of clickable elements within the form.

To fix this bug, the function needs to accurately determine the clickable elements and extract their attributes. Additionally, the way form data is generated needs to be reviewed.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _get_clickable(clickdata, form):
    """
    Returns the clickable element specified in clickdata,
    if the latter is given. If not, it returns the first
    clickable element found
    """
    clickables = [
        el for el in form.xpath(
            'descendant::*[(self::input or self::button)'
            ' and re:test(@type, "^submit$", "i")]'
            '|descendant::button[not(@type)]',
            namespaces={"re": "http://exslt.org/regular-expressions"})
    ]
    if not clickables:
        return

    if clickdata is None:
        el = clickables[0]
        return (el.get('name'), el.get('value') or '')

    nr = clickdata.get('nr', None)
    if nr is not None:
        try:
            el = clickables[nr]  # Modify this line to use the correct index from clickables list
            return (el.get('name'), el.get('value') or '')
        except IndexError:
            pass

    xpath = u'.//' + '|'.join([('input[@%s="%s"]' % (k, v)) for k, v in clickdata.items()])
    el = form.xpath(xpath)
    if len(el) == 1:
        return (el[0].get('name'), el[0].get('value') or '')
    elif len(el) > 1:
        raise ValueError("Multiple elements found (%r) matching the criteria in clickdata: %r" % (el, clickdata))
    else:
        raise ValueError('No clickable element matching clickdata: %r' % (clickdata,))
```

In the corrected code, the selection of the clickable element based on the "nr" attribute is fixed by using the correct index from the clickables list. Additionally, the XPath expression for building the clickable element is modified to accurately identify the element based on the criteria provided in clickdata. These modifications should address the issues and resolve the bug.
