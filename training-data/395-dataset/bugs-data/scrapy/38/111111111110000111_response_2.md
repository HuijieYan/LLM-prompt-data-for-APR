The test case is trying to validate whether the FormRequest class is correctly extracting the form fields from a response containing a form with two input fields. The error message indicates that the function is not correctly extracting the form fields, specifically missing the 'i2' input which is of type 'image'.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the `_get_clickable` function, where it determines the clickable elements in the form. It seems to be missing the logic to handle input elements of type 'image'.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the current implementation of the `_get_clickable` function does not consider input elements of type 'image' as clickable elements.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the `_get_clickable` function to also include input elements of type 'image' as clickable elements. This can be achieved by adding logic to handle input elements of type 'image' and include them as clickable elements in the function's result.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def _get_clickable(clickdata, form):
    """
    Returns the clickable element specified in clickdata,
    if the latter is given. If not, it returns the first
    clickable element found
    """
    clickables = [
        el for el in form.xpath(
            'descendant::*[(self::input or self::button)'
            ' and re:test(@type, "^submit$|^image$", "i")]'
            '|descendant::button[not(@type)]',
            namespaces={"re": "http://exslt.org/regular-expressions"})
        ]
    if not clickables:
        return

    # If we don't have clickdata, we just use the first clickable element
    if clickdata is None:
        el = clickables[0]
        return (el.get('name'), el.get('value') or '')

    # If clickdata is given, we compare it to the clickable elements to find a
    # match. We first look to see if the number is specified in clickdata,
    # because that uniquely identifies the element
    nr = clickdata.get('nr', None)
    if nr is not None:
        try:
            el = list(form.inputs)[nr]
        except IndexError:
            pass
        else:
            return (el.get('name'), el.get('value') or '')

    # We didn't find it, so now we build an XPath expression out of the other
    # arguments, because they can be used as such
    xpath = u'.//*' + \
            u''.join(u'[@%s="%s"]' % c for c in six.iteritems(clickdata))
    el = form.xpath(xpath)
    if len(el) == 1:
        return (el[0].get('name'), el[0].get('value') or '')
    elif len(el) > 1:
        raise ValueError("Multiple elements found (%r) matching the criteria "
                         "in clickdata: %r" % (el, clickdata))
    else:
        raise ValueError('No clickable element matching clickdata: %r' % (clickdata,))
