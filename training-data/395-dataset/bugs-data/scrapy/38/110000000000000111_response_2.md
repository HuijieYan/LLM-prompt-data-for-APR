Potential Error Location:
The issue is likely in the section where the function tries to find a clickable element based on the provided clickdata.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The function does not handle the case where the clickable element is an image input properly, causing it to ignore image inputs.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the XPath expression to include image inputs.
2. Add a condition to handle image inputs separately.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _get_clickable(clickdata, form):
    """
    Returns the clickable element specified in clickdata,
    if the latter is given. If not, it returns the first
    clickable element found
    """
    clickables = [
        el for el in form.xpath(
            'descendant::*[(self::input or self::button or self::img)'  # Modified XPath expression to include image inputs
            ' and re:test(@type, "^submit$", "i")]'
            '|descendant::button[not(@type)]',
            namespaces={"re": "http://exslt.org/regular-expressions"})
        ]
    if not clickables:
        return

    # If we don't have clickdata, we just use the first clickable element
    if clickdata is None:
        el = clickables[0]
        return (el.get('name'), el.get('value') or '')

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
```
