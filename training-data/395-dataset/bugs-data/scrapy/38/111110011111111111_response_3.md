The issue seems to be with the `_get_clickable` function in the `test_from_response_clickdata_does_not_ignore_image` test. The error message indicates that the `fs` variable does not match the expected value.

The potential error in the `_get_clickable` function is that it is not properly handling the case when an image input is present in the form. The `clickables` list is not being constructed correctly due to the presence of an image input, and this is likely causing issues in the test case.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_get_clickable` function to handle image inputs properly. The function should be updated to identify and handle image inputs separately from other types of clickable elements. Additionally, the xpath query used to find clickable elements may need to be adjusted to include image inputs.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_clickable` function:

```python
def _get_clickable(clickdata, form):
    """
    Returns the clickable element specified in clickdata,
    if the latter is given. If not, it returns the first
    clickable element found
    """
    clickables = [
        el for el in form.xpath(
            'descendant::*[(self::input or self::button)'
            ' and re:test(@type, "^submit$", "i")]'
            '|descendant::button[not(@type)]'
            '|descendant::input[@type="image"]',
            namespaces={"re": "http://exslt.org/regular-expressions"})
        ]
    if not clickables:
        return

    # Rest of the function remains the same.
```

By including `descendant::input[@type="image"]` in the xpath query, we can ensure that image inputs are included in the list of clickable elements.

With this modification, the `test_from_response_clickdata_does_not_ignore_image` should pass without any assertion errors.
