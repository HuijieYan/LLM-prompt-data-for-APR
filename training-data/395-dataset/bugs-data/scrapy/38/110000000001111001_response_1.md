The error occurs when the function tries to retrieve the first clickable element from the form. The function is structured to select clickable elements based on certain conditions, but if no clickable elements are found, the code does not handle this situation correctly.

The potential bug occurs when the function attempts to access the first clickable element from the form.inputs. This results in an IndexError if there are no clickable elements, which is not handled properly.

To fix the bug, we can check the length of clickables and return an empty list if there are no clickable elements found. This will prevent the IndexError from occurring.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _get_clickable(clickdata, form):
    """
    Returns the clickable element specified in clickdata,
    if the latter is given. If not, it returns the first
    clickable element found
    """
    clickables = [
        el for el in form.xpath(
            'descendant::*[(self::input or self::button)'
            ' and re:test(@type, "^submit$", "i")]'
            '|descendant::button[not(@type)]',
            namespaces={"re": "http://exslt.org/regular-expressions"})
    ]
    if not clickables:
        return []

    # If we don't have clickdata, we just use the first clickable element
    if clickdata is None:
        el = clickables[0]
        return (el.get('name'), el.get('value') or '')

    # ... rest of the function remains the same
```

In the corrected code, if there are no clickable elements found, the function will return an empty list as expected.

With this fix, the function should handle the case when there are no clickable elements found and prevent the IndexError from occurring.
