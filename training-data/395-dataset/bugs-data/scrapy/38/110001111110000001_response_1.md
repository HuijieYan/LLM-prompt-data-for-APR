The test case test_from_response_clickdata_does_not_ignore_image is testing the construction of a FormRequest using the from_response method. The form in the response contains two input fields: one text input and one image input. The test checks whether these fields are correctly parsed and included in the FormRequest object.

The error message indicates that the assertion self.assertEqual(fs, {b'i1': [b'i1v'], b'i2': [b'i2v']}) failed. The expected dictionary should contain both 'i1' and 'i2' keys with their respective values. However, the actual result only contains the 'i1' key and its value.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the _get_clickable method. It is responsible for extracting clickable elements from an HTML form and returning their attributes. In this case, it is not correctly identifying the image input element ('i2') and including it in the result.

The bug occurs because the _get_clickable method is using an XPath expression to identify clickable elements, but it is not properly handling image inputs. Image inputs are different from regular inputs and have specific attributes like 'src' and 'alt' instead of 'type'. The current XPath expression used in _get_clickable does not account for this difference, leading to the failure to capture the image input.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the XPath expression in _get_clickable to properly handle image inputs. The expression should be updated to include image input elements by checking for the presence of the 'type' attribute with the value 'image'.

Additionally, the method should be updated to include image inputs in the result dictionary by extracting their attributes such as 'name' and 'value'.

Here's the corrected code for the _get_clickable method:

```python
def _get_clickable(clickdata, form):
    """
    Returns the clickable element specified in clickdata,
    if the latter is given. If not, it returns the first
    clickable element found
    """
    clickables = form.xpath(
        'descendant::input[(self::input and @type="submit") or @type="image"] | descendant::button[not(@type)]'
    )
    if not clickables:
        return

    # If we don't have clickdata, we just use the first clickable element
    if clickdata is None:
        el = clickables[0]
        return (el.get('name'), el.get('value') or '')

    # If clickdata is given, we compare it to the clickable elements to find a match.
    # If the 'nr' attribute is specified in clickdata, we use it to identify the element
    nr = clickdata.get('nr', None)
    if nr is not None:
        try:
            el = list(form.inputs)[nr]
            return (el.get('name'), el.get('value') or '')
        except IndexError:
            pass

    # For other cases, build an XPath expression using the attributes in clickdata
    xpath_attrs = ['@{0}="{1}"'.format(k, v) for k, v in clickdata.items()]
    xpath = 'descendant::*[' + ' and '.join(xpath_attrs) + ']'
    el = form.xpath(xpath)
    if len(el) == 1:
        return (el[0].get('name'), el[0].get('value') or '')
    elif len(el) > 1:
        raise ValueError("Multiple elements found ({}) matching the criteria in clickdata: {}".format(el, clickdata))
    else:
        raise ValueError('No clickable element matching clickdata: {}'.format(clickdata))
```
