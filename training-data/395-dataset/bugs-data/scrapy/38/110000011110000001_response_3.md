The test case `test_from_response_clickdata_does_not_ignore_image` is checking if a form submission includes both input fields `i1` and `i2`, but it failed due to missing the `i2` field. This is likely related to the `_get_clickable` function that is used to extract the clickable elements from the HTML form.

The potential error location within the `_get_clickable` function is likely in the XPath expression generation and matching process. It seems that the XPath expression used to find the clickable elements is not correctly identifying all the input fields within the form.

The bug occurred because the XPath expression used to find the clickable elements in the form was not capturing the `input` element with type `image`. The current XPath is only capturing input elements with type `submit`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the XPath expression to include the `input` element with type `image`. Additionally, we should ensure that the correct input fields are being extracted according to the test case requirements.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_clickable` function:

```python
def _get_clickable(clickdata, form):
    clickables = [
        el for el in form.xpath(
            'descendant::*[(self::input or self::button or self::image)'
            ' and re:test(@type, "^submit$|^image$", "i")]'
            '|descendant::button[not(@type)]',
            namespaces={"re": "http://exslt.org/regular-expressions"})
    ]
    if not clickables:
        return

    if clickdata is None:
        el = clickables[0]
        return (el.get('name'), el.get('value') or '')

    nr = clickdata.get('nr', None)
    if nr is not None:
        try:
            el = list(form.inputs)[nr]
        except IndexError:
            pass
        else:
            return (el.get('name'), el.get('value') or '')

    xpath = u'.//*' + \
            u''.join(u'[@%s="%s"]' % c for c in six.iteritems(clickdata))
    el = form.xpath(xpath)
    if len(el) == 1:
        return (el[0].get('name'), el[0].get('value') or '')
    elif len(el) > 1:
        raise ValueError("Multiple elements found (%r) matching the criteria "
                         "in clickdata: %r" % (el, clickdata))
    else:
        raise ValueError('No clickable element matching clickdata: %r' % (clickdata,))
``` 

In the corrected code, the XPath expression in the `form.xpath` call has been updated to include `self::image` along with `self::input` and `self::button`. This change allows the XPath expression to capture input elements with type `image` as well.
