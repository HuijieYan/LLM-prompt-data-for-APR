1. The test case `test_from_response_clickdata_does_not_ignore_image` is comparing the form data (fs) generated from the `req` object with the expected form data `{b'i1': [b'i1v'], b'i2': [b'i2v']}`. The error message indicates that the actual form data only contains `{b'i1': [b'i1v']}` and does not include the image input `i2`. This suggests that the image input is being ignored or not included in the form data as expected.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the `_get_clickable` method, as this method is responsible for identifying clickable elements in a form, and it might not be handling image inputs correctly.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `_get_clickable` method is not properly handling image inputs when constructing the form data.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Modifying the XPath query or logic in the `_get_clickable` method to correctly identify and include image inputs in the list of clickable elements.
   - Verifying that the XPath query used in the `_get_clickable` method captures all necessary input types, including image inputs.

5. Corrected code for the `_get_clickable` method:

```python
from lxml import etree
import six
import re

def _get_clickable(clickdata, form):
    clickables = [
        el for el in form.xpath(
            'descendant::*[(self::input or self::button or self::image)'
            ' and re:test(@type, "^submit$", "i")]'
            '|descendant::button[not(@type)]',
            namespaces={"re": "http://exslt.org/regular-expressions"})
    ]
    if not clickables:
        return

    if clickdata is None:
        el = clickables[0]
        return (el.get('name'), el.get('value') or '')

    nr = clickdata.get('nr', None)
    if nr is not None:
        try:
            el = list(form.inputs)[nr]
        except IndexError:
            pass
        else:
            return (el.get('name'), el.get('value') or '')

    other_attrs = {k: v for k, v in six.iteritems(clickdata) if k != 'nr'}
    xpath = u".//*" + u"".join(u'[@%s="%s"]' % c for c in six.iteritems(other_attrs))
    el = form.xpath(xpath)
    if len(el) == 1:
        return (el[0].get('name'), el[0].get('value') or '')
    elif len(el) > 1:
        raise ValueError("Multiple elements found (%r) matching the criteria in clickdata: %r" % (el, clickdata))
    else:
        raise ValueError('No clickable element matching clickdata: %r' % (clickdata,))
``` 

In the corrected code, the XPath query in the `_get_clickable` method has been modified to include `self::image` along with `self::input` and `self::button` to capture image inputs as clickable elements. This should address the issue of ignoring image inputs and ensure that they are included in the list of clickable elements.
