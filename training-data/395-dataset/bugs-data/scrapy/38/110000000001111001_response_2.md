Potential Error Location:
The issue is likely occurring in the section of the code where the first clickable element is being returned if no clickdata is provided. It seems that the code is not checking for the presence of a button element.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug may be occurring because the code is only checking for input elements with type="submit" and button elements without a type attribute. It is not properly handling the case where a button element with type="submit" is present.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the XPath expression to include button elements with type="submit". Additionally, we should handle the case where a button element with type="submit" is present.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _get_clickable(clickdata, form):
    clickables = [
        el for el in form.xpath(
            'descendant::*[(self::input or (self::button and (@type="submit" or not(@type))))]'
            '|descendant::button[not(@type)]',
            namespaces={"re": "http://exslt.org/regular-expressions"})
    ]
    if not clickables:
        return

    # If we don't have clickdata, we just use the first clickable element
    if clickdata is None:
        el = clickables[0]
        return (el.get('name'), el.get('value') or '')

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```
In the corrected code, the XPath expression has been modified to include button elements with type="submit" as well. This should address the issue of not properly identifying button elements.
