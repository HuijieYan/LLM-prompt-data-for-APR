The issue is that the function `_get_clickable` is not identifying the image input element correctly. In the provided test case, the form data `fs` is expected to include both `i1` and `i2` with their respective values. However, the function is not identifying the image input element correctly, resulting in the incorrect form data.

The potential error location is within the section of the code where the function is identifying clickable elements. Specifically, the condition for identifying image input elements may be incorrect.

The bug occurs because the function is not correctly identifying image input elements. The code is using an XPath expression to find clickable elements, but the expression does not correctly include image input elements.

To fix the bug, the condition for identifying image input elements needs to be updated to ensure they are included in the list of `clickables`. This can be done by modifying the XPath expression to also target image input elements.

Here is the corrected code for the `_get_clickable` function:

```python
def _get_clickable(clickdata, form):
    clickables = [
        el for el in form.xpath(
            'descendant::*[(self::input or self::button or (self::input and @type="image"))'
            ' and re:test(@type, "^submit$", "i")]'
            '|descendant::button[not(@type)]',
            namespaces={"re": "http://exslt.org/regular-expressions"})
        ]
    if not clickables:
        return

    # If we don't have clickdata, we just use the first clickable element
    if clickdata is None:
        el = clickables[0]
        return (el.get('name'), el.get('value') or '')

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

By including `(self::input and @type="image")` in the XPath expression, image input elements will now be correctly identified as clickable elements. This should resolve the issue with the form data not including the image input element when using the `FormRequest.from_response` method.
