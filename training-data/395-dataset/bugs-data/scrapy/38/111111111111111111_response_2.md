The test case `test_from_response_clickdata_does_not_ignore_image` in the file `/Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_38/tests/test_http_request.py` sets up an HTML form with two input elements - one for text and one for an image. It then checks if the form data generated from the response contains both these input elements.

The error message indicates that the test is failing because the form data only contains the input for text (`i1`) and not the input for the image (`i2`). This suggests that there is an issue with how the image input is being processed.

The problematic function is `_get_clickable` in the `form.py` file. This function is meant to find the clickable elements from a form. The faulty logic is likely in the section where it handles image inputs.

The issue is occurring because the current logic of the function is not properly identifying image inputs as clickable elements, and therefore, they are not being added to the form data.

One possible approach to fixing this bug is to extend the logic of the function to correctly handle image inputs as clickable elements. This may involve modifying the XPath expression used to identify clickable elements to also include image inputs.

Below is the corrected code for the `_get_clickable` function:

```python
def _get_clickable(clickdata, form):
    clickables = [
        el for el in form.xpath(
            'descendant::*[(self::input or self::button or self::image)'
            ' and (re:test(@type, "^submit$", "i") or not(@type))]'
            '|descendant::button[not(@type)]',
            namespaces={"re": "http://exslt.org/regular-expressions"})
        ]
    if not clickables:
        return

    if clickdata is None:
        el = clickables[0]
        return (el.get('name'), el.get('value') or '')

    nr = clickdata.get('nr', None)
    if nr is not None:
        try:
            el = list(form.inputs)[nr]
        except IndexError:
            pass
        else:
            return (el.get('name'), el.get('value') or '')

    xpath = u'.//*' + \
            u''.join(u'[@%s="%s"]' % c for c in six.iteritems(clickdata))
    el = form.xpath(xpath)
    if len(el) == 1:
        return (el[0].get('name'), el[0].get('value') or '')
    elif len(el) > 1:
        raise ValueError("Multiple elements found (%r) matching the criteria "
                         "in clickdata: %r" % (el, clickdata))
    else:
        raise ValueError('No clickable element matching clickdata: %r' % (clickdata,))
```

In the corrected code, the XPath expression used to identify clickable elements has been modified to include image inputs as well. This should ensure that image inputs are correctly recognized as clickable elements and added to the form data.
