The test case test_from_response_clickdata_does_not_ignore_image is trying to check if the FormRequest correctly processes the HTML form and extracts the input fields. However, the assertion is failing because the input field of type "image" is not being included in the result.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the retrieval of clickable elements in the form, specifically in the line:
```
el = clickables[0]
```
This line assumes that if clickdata is None, the first clickable element should be returned. However, this logic is flawed as it does not consider the possibility of an image input type being present, which is the case in the given test.

The bug occurs because the _get_clickable function does not handle input elements of type "image" properly. When the input element of type "image" is encountered, it fails to include it in the list of clickable elements.

To fix the bug, the _get_clickable function needs to be updated to properly handle input elements of type "image" and include them in the list of clickable elements.

Here's the corrected code for the _get_clickable function:

```python
def _get_clickable(clickdata, form):
    clickables = [
        el for el in form.xpath(
            'descendant::*[(self::input or self::button)'
            ' and re:test(@type, "^submit$|^image$", "i")]'
            '|descendant::button[not(@type)]',
            namespaces={"re": "http://exslt.org/regular-expressions"})
    ]
    if not clickables:
        return

    if clickdata is None:
        el = clickables[0]
        return (el.get('name'), el.get('value') or '')

    nr = clickdata.get('nr', None)
    if nr is not None:
        try:
            el = list(form.inputs)[nr]
        except IndexError:
            pass
        else:
            return (el.get('name'), el.get('value') or '')

    xpath = u'.//*' + \
            u''.join(u'[@%s="%s"]' % c for c in six.iteritems(clickdata))
    el = form.xpath(xpath)
    if len(el) == 1:
        return (el[0].get('name'), el[0].get('value') or '')
    elif len(el) > 1:
        raise ValueError("Multiple elements found (%r) matching the criteria "
                         "in clickdata: %r" % (el, clickdata))
    else:
        raise ValueError('No clickable element matching clickdata: %r' % (clickdata,))
```

With this correction, the _get_clickable function now properly handles input elements of type "image" and includes them in the list of clickable elements when extracting clickable elements from a form. This should resolve the issue and make the test case pass.
