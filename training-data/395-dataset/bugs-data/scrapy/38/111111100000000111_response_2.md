Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the given function is in the clickables list comprehension where it checks for input type "submit" and button type not specified. This may be excluding input types like "image" which are also clickable elements.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug seems to be occurring because the function is not considering input types like "image" as clickable elements, which is causing the issue of not being able to click image inputs.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the XPath expression to include input type "image" as a clickable element.
2. Adjust the logic to consider all types of clickable elements, including input type "image".
3. Ensure that all clickable elements are captured in the clickables list.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _get_clickable(clickdata, form):
    """
    Returns the clickable element specified in clickdata,
    if the latter is given. If not, it returns the first
    clickable element found
    """
    clickables = [
        el for el in form.xpath(
            'descendant::*[(self::input or self::button or self::image)'  # Added self::image to include image inputs
            ' and re:test(@type, "^submit$|image$", "i")]'  # Modified to include image inputs
            '|descendant::button[not(@type)]',
            namespaces={"re": "http://exslt.org/regular-expressions"})
        ]
    if not clickables:
        return

    # If we don't have clickdata, we just use the first clickable element
    if clickdata is None:
        el = clickables[0]
        return (el.get('name'), el.get('value') or '')

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    ...
```
In the corrected code, the XPath expression is modified to include `self::image` and `input type="image"` in order to include image inputs as clickable elements. This should fix the bug and allow for clicking image inputs as well.
