The issue seems to be with the handling of image inputs in the `_get_clickable` function. When the form contains an image input, the current implementation does not properly handle it, which leads to a mismatch between the expected and actual values in the test case.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the part where it checks for clickable elements and returns the first one if clickdata is not provided. It seems that the current implementation does not consider image inputs as clickable elements.

The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle image inputs when determining clickable elements. As a result, the test case fails to match the expected value with the actual value.

To fix the bug, we can update the XPath expression used to select clickable elements so that it includes image inputs as well.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_clickable` function:

```python
def _get_clickable(clickdata, form):
    clickables = [
        el for el in form.xpath(
            'descendant::*[(self::input or self::button or self::image)'  # Include image inputs as clickable elements
            ' and re:test(@type, "^submit$", "i")]'
            '|descendant::button[not(@type)]',
            namespaces={"re": "http://exslt.org/regular-expressions"})
    ]
    if not clickables:
        return

    if clickdata is None:
        el = clickables[0]
        return (el.get('name'), el.get('value') or '')

    nr = clickdata.get('nr', None)
    if nr is not None:
        try:
            el = list(form.inputs)[nr]
        except IndexError:
            pass
        else:
            return (el.get('name'), el.get('value') or '')

    xpath = u'.//*' + \
            u''.join(u'[@%s="%s"]' % c for c in six.iteritems(clickdata))
    el = form.xpath(xpath)
    if len(el) == 1:
        return (el[0].get('name'), el[0].get('value') or '')
    elif len(el) > 1:
        raise ValueError("Multiple elements found (%r) matching the criteria "
                         "in clickdata: %r" % (el, clickdata))
    else:
        raise ValueError('No clickable element matching clickdata: %r' % (clickdata,))
```

By including `self::image` in the XPath expression, the function now considers image inputs as clickable elements, which should address the issue with image inputs being ignored.
