The test case `test_from_response_clickdata_does_not_ignore_image` is checking for the equality of the form data (`fs`) with `{b'i1': [b'i1v'], b'i2': [b'i2v']}`, but the current implementation returns only `{b'i1': [b'i1v']}`. This means that the second input field with name `i2` and value `i2v` is not being considered in the result.

The potential error location within the function is likely in the part where it filters the clickable elements. It is possible that the XPath expression used to filter the clickable elements might not be capturing all the relevant elements.

The current implementation of the function does not consider the `input` with type `image` as a clickable element, which is causing the issue. To fix this, we need to modify the XPath expression to also consider `input` elements with type `image` as clickable.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_clickable(clickdata, form):
    clickables = [
        el for el in form.xpath(
            'descendant::*[(self::input or self::button or self::img)'  # <-- Modified xpath to include 'img' for type 'image'
            ' and re:test(@type, "^submit$|^image$", "i")]'
            '|descendant::button[not(@type)]',
            namespaces={"re": "http://exslt.org/regular-expressions"})
    ]
    if not clickables:
        return

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```
