The error is occurring when the code attempts to call the `decode` method on a non-string type, specifically on an `int` object. This is because the function `_xg_characters` is attempting to decode the value, assuming it's a string, but it's actually an integer.

To fix this, we should modify the `_export_xml_field` function to handle non-string types appropriately. This includes not attempting to decode non-string types and handling them differently from string types.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif hasattr(serialized_value, '__iter__') and not isinstance(serialized_value, str):  # Check if value is iterable and not a string
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', value)
    else:
        self.xg.characters(str(serialized_value))  # Convert the value to a string and write it as characters
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```
