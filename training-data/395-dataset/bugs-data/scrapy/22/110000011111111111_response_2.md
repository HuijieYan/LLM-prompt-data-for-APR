## Analysis
The error message indicates that the AttributeError occurs because the `_xg_characters` method is trying to decode a non-string value. This implies that there is a type mismatch when serializing non-string values, leading to the AttributeError.

## Potential Error Location
The potential error location within the `_export_xml_field` method is the handling of non-string types, specifically the `else` condition where `_xg_characters` is called.

## Reasons for the Bug
The bug occurs because the function does not handle non-string values properly. When encountering non-string values, it tries to decode them, which is only applicable to string types.

## Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug
1. Add type checking before calling `_xg_characters` to ensure it is only called on string types.
2. Modify the serialization logic to appropriately handle different data types, such as converting non-string types to string before passing them to `_xg_characters`.

## Corrected Code
```python
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif is_listlike(serialized_value):
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', str(value))  # Convert non-string types to string
    else:
        if isinstance(serialized_value, six.string_types):  # Type check before calling _xg_characters
            self._xg_characters(serialized_value)
        else:
            self._xg_characters(str(serialized_value))  # Convert non-string types to string
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```
In the corrected code, non-string types are converted to string before calling `_xg_characters` to handle the serialization of non-string values. Additionally, type checking is applied to ensure that `_xg_characters` is only called on string types.
