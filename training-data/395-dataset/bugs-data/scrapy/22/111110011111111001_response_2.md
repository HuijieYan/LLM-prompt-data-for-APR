The error message indicates that the issue is with the `_xg_characters` function, specifically the line `serialized_value = serialized_value.decode(self.encoding)`. The error is occurring because the function is trying to decode a boolean value, which is not possible.

The reason behind the error is that the `_xg_characters` function is expecting a text type (string) for serialization, but it's receiving a boolean value instead.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `_export_xml_field` function to handle the boolean values separately before passing them to the `_xg_characters` function. We can convert the boolean value to a string before passing it to `_xg_characters` so that the decoding issue is resolved.

Here's the corrected code for the `_export_xml_field` function:

```python
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif is_listlike(serialized_value):
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', value)
    elif isinstance(serialized_value, bool):  # Handling boolean values separately
        self._xg_characters(str(serialized_value))  # Convert boolean to string
    else:
        self._xg_characters(serialized_value)
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```

With this correction, the boolean values will be handled separately and converted to strings before passing them to the `_xg_characters` function, resolving the decoding error.
