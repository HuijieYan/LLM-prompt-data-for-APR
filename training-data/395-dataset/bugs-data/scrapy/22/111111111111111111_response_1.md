The error occurs in the `_xg_characters` method of the `XmlItemExporter` class. The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError when attempting to decode a non-string serialized value.

The issue occurs because the `_xg_characters` method is trying to decode a non-string value, which is incorrect. The method should only be called for string values and not for other types such as int, bool, or datetime.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_xg_characters` method is only called for string values. For non-string values, we should handle them differently, such as directly inserting them into the XML without decoding.

Here is the corrected code for the `_export_xml_field` method:

```python
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif is_listlike(serialized_value):
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', value)
    elif isinstance(serialized_value, str):
        self.xg.characters(serialized_value)
    else:
        self.xg.characters(str(serialized_value))  # Convert non-string values to string
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```

In the corrected code, we added a condition to check if the `serialized_value` is a string using the `isinstance` function. If it is a string, we directly insert it into the XML using `self.xg.characters(serialized_value)`. If it's not a string, we convert it to a string using `str(serialized_value)` before inserting it into the XML.

By making these changes, the bug should be fixed, and the XML export should work correctly for non-string types.
