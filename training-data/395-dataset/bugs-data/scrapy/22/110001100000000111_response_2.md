The error is occurring in the XMLFeedExporter when trying to convert non-string types to XML, such as integers and booleans. The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError in the _xg_characters() method, specifically on the line where it tries to decode the serialized_value.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the conditional block that checks whether serialized_value is listlike. If neither it has items attribute nor it is listlike, it directly calls _xg_characters(), which is incorrect for non-string values.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that _export_xml_field() is not handling non-string values correctly. This results in the _xg_characters() method attempting to decode non-string values, causing the AttributeError.

To fix this bug, we need to handle non-string serialized values differently, without trying to decode them. Instead, we should convert them to strings before adding them to the XML structure.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif is_listlike(serialized_value):
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', value)
    else:
        self._xg_characters(str(serialized_value))  # Convert non-string values to strings
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```
