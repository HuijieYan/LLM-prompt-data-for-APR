The error occurs when the `_xg_characters` method tries to decode a non-string value using the `decode` method, which is only applicable to string types.

To fix this bug, you can modify the `_xg_characters` method to handle non-string types differently. You can convert the non-string values to strings before trying to decode them. Additionally, the logic for handling non-string types within the `_export_xml_field` method can be modified to accommodate this change.

Here's the corrected code for the `_xg_characters` and `_export_xml_field` methods:

```python
# Corrected function source code

# Updated _xg_characters method to handle non-string types
def _xg_characters(self, serialized_value):
    if not isinstance(serialized_value, str):
        serialized_value = str(serialized_value)
    self.xg.characters(serialized_value)

# Updated _export_xml_field method to handle non-string types
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif is_listlike(serialized_value):
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', value)
    else:
        self._xg_characters(serialized_value)
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```

The `_xg_characters` method now checks if the `serialized_value` is not a string, then converts it to a string using `str(serialized_value)` before passing it to `self.xg.characters`.

The `_export_xml_field` method remains mostly unchanged, with the addition of calling `_xg_characters` for non-string values instead of directly sending them to `self.xg.characters`. This ensures that non-string values are converted to strings before being processed by the XML generator.
