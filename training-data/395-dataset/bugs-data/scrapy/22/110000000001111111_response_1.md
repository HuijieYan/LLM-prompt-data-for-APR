The bug occurs in the `_export_xml_field` function in the `scrapy/exporters.py` file. The error occurs when the function tries to call the `decode` method on non-string types such as int, bool, or datetime. This is because the function incorrectly handles non-string types when exporting to XML format.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_export_xml_field` function to properly handle non-string types that are being exported. We can use conditional statements to check the type of the `serialized_value` and handle it accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_export_xml_field` function:

```python
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif isinstance(serialized_value, list):
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', value)
    else:
        self.xg.characters(str(serialized_value))
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```

In the corrected code, we first check if `serialized_value` is a dictionary and if so, recursively call `_export_xml_field` for each key-value pair. Then, we check if `serialized_value` is a list and if so, iterate through its elements and call `_export_xml_field` for each element. Finally, if `serialized_value` is neither a dictionary nor a list, we convert it to a string using `str()` and then add it as characters to the XML.

These changes ensure that non-string types are properly handled when exporting to XML format, fixing the AttributeError issue mentioned in the GitHub issue.
