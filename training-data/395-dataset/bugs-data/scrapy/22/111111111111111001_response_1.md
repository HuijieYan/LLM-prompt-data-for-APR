The potential error location is in the `_xg_characters` method within the `XmlItemExporter` class. The error occurs when trying to decode a boolean object, which is not possible since a boolean object does not have a `decode` method.

The root cause of the bug is that the code is not handling non-string data types properly. It seems that the code is trying to convert all types of data to a string, but it should handle different types of data differently (e.g., converting a boolean to a string, formatting a date differently, etc).

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_export_xml_field` method to handle different types of data appropriately. We can create a separate method for each type to handle the logic for that type. This will make the code more readable and maintainable.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif isinstance(serialized_value, list):
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', value)
    elif isinstance(serialized_value, bool):
        self._xg_characters(str(serialized_value).lower())
    elif isinstance(serialized_value, (int, float)):
        self._xg_characters(str(serialized_value))
    elif isinstance(serialized_value, datetime):
        self._xg_characters(serialized_value.strftime("%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S"))
    else:
        self._xg_characters(str(serialized_value))
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```

With this modification, non-string data types such as boolean, list, integer, float, and datetime will be handled properly when exporting to XML.
