Based on the provided information, the bug appears to be related to the handling of non-string types when exporting items to XML using Scrapy 1.0.4. The error occurs when attempting to serialize non-string types, such as integers, booleans, or datetime objects.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `_xg_characters` method, as it seems to be responsible for converting non-string types to strings for XML serialization.

The bug occurs because the `_xg_characters` method assumes that the serialized value is a string and attempts to call the `decode` method on non-string types, resulting in an AttributeError.

To fix this bug, the `_xg_characters` method should be modified to handle non-string types appropriately. It should check the type of the serialized value and convert it to a string if necessary, without assuming that all types can be decoded.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif is_listlike(serialized_value):
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', value)
    else:
        self._xg_characters(str(serialized_value))  # Convert non-string types to string
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```

In the corrected code, for non-string types, the `str` function is used to convert the value to a string before passing it to the `_xg_characters` method. This ensures that non-string types are handled appropriately during XML serialization.
