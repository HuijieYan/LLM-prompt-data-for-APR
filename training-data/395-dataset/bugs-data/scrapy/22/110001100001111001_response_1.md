The error in the provided function is that the `_xg_characters` function is called within the `_export_xml_field` function, but there is no definition for the `_xg_characters` function provided. This will raise a NameError when the `_export_xml_field` function is called.

To fix this bug, the `_xg_characters` function needs to be defined. Assuming that `_xg_characters` is intended to handle serialized values for XML generation, it should be included in the code. Additionally, the `is_listlike` function is called in the `_export_xml_field` function, but it is not provided in the given code.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _xg_characters(self, serialized_value):
    self.xg.characters(str(serialized_value))

def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif isinstance(serialized_value, (list, tuple, set)):
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', value)
    else:
        self._xg_characters(serialized_value)
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```

In the corrected code, the `_xg_characters` function is defined to handle the serialized values for XML generation. Additionally, `is_listlike` is replaced with a check using `isinstance` to handle listlike objects. This will resolve the NameError and ensure that the function can handle the input parameters provided in the test cases.
