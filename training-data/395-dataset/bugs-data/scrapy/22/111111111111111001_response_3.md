The error occurs in the `_xg_characters` method of the `XmlItemExporter` class. The error message indicates that it is trying to decode a boolean value, which is not possible because boolean values do not have a `decode` attribute.

The bug occurs because the `_xg_characters` method is being called with non-string types, such as boolean, integer, and datetime objects. The `_xg_characters` method is designed to handle string types, so it encounters an error when trying to decode non-string types.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_export_xml_field` method to handle non-string types appropriately. We can convert non-string types to strings before passing them to `_xg_characters` or handle each data type differently within `_export_xml_field`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_export_xml_field` method:

```python
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif isinstance(serialized_value, list):
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', value)
    else:
        self._xg_characters(str(serialized_value))
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```

In this corrected code, we explicitly handle lists by checking if `serialized_value` is a list. If it's a list, we iterate over the elements and pass them to `_export_xml_field`. For other types, we convert them to strings before passing them to `_xg_characters`. This approach ensures that non-string types are handled appropriately.
