The error occurs when exporting non-string types through the XMLFeedExporter. The test case `test_nonstring_types_item` is failing with an AttributeError when trying to encode a boolean value. The error message points to the `_xg_characters` method in the Scrapy exporters file as the location of the bug.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `_xg_characters` method is trying to decode non-string types, such as boolean values, which leads to an AttributeError because boolean objects do not have an attribute 'decode'.

To fix the bug, the `_xg_characters` method needs to handle non-string types differently, without trying to decode them.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif is_listlike(serialized_value):
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', value)
    else:
        self._xg_characters(serialized_value)
    self.xg.endElement(name)
    
def _xg_characters(self, serialized_value):
    # handle non-string types differently
    self.xg.characters(str(serialized_value))
```
