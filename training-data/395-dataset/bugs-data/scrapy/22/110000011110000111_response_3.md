The error occurs during the export of non-string types through XMLFeedExporter. The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError when trying to decode a non-string value.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `_xg_characters` method, where it attempts to decode a non-string value using the `decode` method, which is not applicable to non-string values.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `_xg_characters` method is trying to decode non-string values, causing an AttributeError.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to check if the `serialized_value` is a string before attempting to decode it. If it's not a string, it should be directly converted to a string.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif is_listlike(serialized_value):
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', value)
    else:
        if isinstance(serialized_value, six.text_type):
            self._xg_characters(serialized_value)
        else:
            self.xg.characters(str(serialized_value))
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```

In the corrected code, before calling `_xg_characters`, it checks if `serialized_value` is a string. If it is, it calls `_xg_characters`. Otherwise, it converts `serialized_value` to a string and then uses `self.xg.characters` to handle non-string values.
