1. The error occurs when the `export_item` method is called with a non-string item, leading to an `AttributeError` on the `serialized_value` in the `_xg_characters` method.

2. The potential error location is within the `else` block in the `_export_xml_field` method, where the `_xg_characters` method is called.

3. The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the `_xg_characters` method is trying to decode a non-string value, causing the `AttributeError`.

4. To fix the bug, it's necessary to handle the non-string values differently within the `_export_xml_field` method. Specifically, when encountering non-string values, an explicit conversion to string should be performed before passing the value to `_xg_characters`.

5. Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif is_listlike(serialized_value):
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', value)
    else:
        self._xg_characters(str(serialized_value))  # Convert non-string value to string
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```

With the correction, non-string values are explicitly converted to strings before being passed to the `_xg_characters` method, resolving the `AttributeError` when exporting non-string types.
