The issue seems to be that the '_xg_characters' function is trying to decode the 'serialized_value' which can cause an 'AttributeError' for non-string types such as 'int', 'bool', and 'datetime' objects.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the '_xg_characters' function to handle different types appropriately by converting them to strings.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif is_listlike(serialized_value):
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', value)
    else:
        self._xg_characters(str(serialized_value))  # Convert serialized_value to string
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```

In the corrected code, we first check for the type of 'serialized_value' using 'hasattr' and 'is_listlike' functions. If it is not a list-like object and does not have items, we convert it to a string using the 'str' function before passing it to the '_xg_characters' function.

This approach ensures that non-string types are correctly handled when exporting to XML and should resolve the 'AttributeError' when exporting non-string types through XMLFeedExporter.
