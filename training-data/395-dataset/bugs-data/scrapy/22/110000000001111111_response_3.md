The issue is likely occurring in the `_export_xml_field` function, specifically in the `elif is_listlike(serialized_value):` condition. It appears that when `serialized_value` is not a list, the code tries to call `self._xg_characters(serialized_value)`, which likely leads to the AttributeError due to inappropriate handling of non-string types.

The bug occurs because the code does not properly handle non-string types when exporting XML fields. It attempts to call the `decode` method on non-string types, which causes the AttributeError.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_export_xml_field` function to handle the different types appropriately. We should check if the `serialized_value` is of type `str` and directly write it to XML, or else convert it to a string using `str(serialized_value)`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_export_xml_field` function:

```python
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif isinstance(serialized_value, list):
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', value)
    else:
        self.xg.characters(str(serialized_value))
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```

With this correction, the function properly handles non-string types when exporting XML fields. Now the code should work without raising an AttributeError for non-string types.
