1. The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError related to the 'bool' object not having the 'decode' attribute. This error occurs within the `_xg_characters` method of the `XmlItemExporter` class.

2. The potential error location is within the `_xg_characters` method, where it attempts to decode a serialized boolean value which leads to the AttributeError.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `_xg_characters` method is assuming that the serialized value is always of type `six.text_type`, and attempts to decode it. However, in this specific case, the serialized value is a boolean, leading to the AttributeError.

4. To fix the bug, the `_xg_characters` method should check the type of the serialized value and handle the boolean case differently. It can convert the boolean value to a string before encoding it, or handle it in a way appropriate for boolean values.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif is_listlike(serialized_value):
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', value)
    else:
        if isinstance(serialized_value, bool):
            serialized_value = str(serialized_value)  # Convert boolean to string before encoding
            self._xg_characters(serialized_value)
        else:
            self._xg_characters(serialized_value)
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```
