The error occurs because the `_xg_characters` method is expecting the `serialized_value` to be a string, and it tries to decode it using the `decode` method. However, for non-string types such as bool, int, and datetime, the `decode` method cannot be used, resulting in an AttributeError.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_export_xml_field` method to handle non-string types properly. When encountering non-string types, we should convert them to string before passing them to the `_xg_characters` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `_export_xml_field` method:

```python
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif is_listlike(serialized_value):
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', value)
    else:
        self._xg_characters(str(serialized_value))
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```

In the corrected code, we convert the `serialized_value` to a string before passing it to the `_xg_characters` method. This will prevent the AttributeError when trying to decode non-string types.
