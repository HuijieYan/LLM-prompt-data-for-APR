Potential error location:
The potential error in the `_export_xml_field` function is that the `self.xg.startElement` and `self.xg.endElement` methods are being used, possibly without being properly initialized or defined within the class.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the `self.xg.startElement` and `self.xg.endElement` methods are being called within the `_export_xml_field` function, but they are not defined or initialized within the class. This causes the function to fail when trying to access these methods.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the `self.xg` object is properly initialized and defined within the class. If not, initialize it properly or define the necessary methods.
2. If `self.xg` is supposed to be an external object, make sure it is properly passed to the class and accessible within the function.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    # Assuming self.xg is an external object passed to the class
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif is_listlike(serialized_value):
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', value)
    else:
        self._xg_characters(serialized_value)
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```
