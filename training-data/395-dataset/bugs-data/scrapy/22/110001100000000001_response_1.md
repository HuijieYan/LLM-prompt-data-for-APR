Potential Error Location: The potential error location is in the `if` condition where it checks if the `serialized_value` has an attribute `items`. 

Reason for the Bug: The bug occurs because the function `is_listlike` is not defined in the given code, and it's not clear what it's supposed to do. Also, the logic in the `if` condition seems unclear.

Approach for Fixing the Bug: The `is_listlike` function should be defined to check if the `serialized_value` is a list-like object (e.g., list, tuple, etc.). Additionally, the logic inside the `if` condition needs to be re-evaluated and corrected to handle different types of `serialized_value` appropriately.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items') and isinstance(serialized_value, dict):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif isinstance(serialized_value, (list, tuple)):
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', value)
    else:
        self._xg_characters(serialized_value)
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```
