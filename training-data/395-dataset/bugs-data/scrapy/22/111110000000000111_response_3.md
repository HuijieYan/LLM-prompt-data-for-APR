The error is due to the `AttributeError` that occurs when trying to decode a non-string object in the `_xg_characters` method. This method is used to handle non-string types when exporting XML fields.

The bug occurs when the method `_xg_characters` attempts to decode non-string types using the `decode` method, which is only applicable to string types. This leads to the `AttributeError` as shown in the error message.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_xg_characters` method to handle non-string types without using the `decode` method. Instead, we can convert non-string types to string before further processing.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class XmlItemExporter(BaseItemExporter):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _xg_characters(self, serialized_value):
        if isinstance(serialized_value, str):
            return serialized_value
        else:
            return str(serialized_value)

    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
        self.xg.startElement(name, {})
        if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
            for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
                self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
        elif is_listlike(serialized_value):
            for value in serialized_value:
                self._export_xml_field('value', value)
        else:
            self._xg_characters(serialized_value)
        self.xg.endElement(name)
```

In the corrected code, the `_xg_characters` method is modified to check if the `serialized_value` is a string before returning it directly. If it's not a string, it's converted to a string using the `str` function before further processing. This ensures that non-string types are handled correctly when exporting XML fields.
