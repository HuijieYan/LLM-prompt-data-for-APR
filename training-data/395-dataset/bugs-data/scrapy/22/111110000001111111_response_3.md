The bug occurs due to a mismatch between the data types being passed to the `_xg_characters` method for non-string types such as integers, booleans, and datetime objects.

An AttributeError is raised because the `_xg_characters` method is attempting to call the `decode` method on serialized non-string values, which only works for string objects. This is evident from the error message: "AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'decode'."

To fix the bug, we should modify the `_export_xml_field` method to handle non-string data types appropriately. We can convert non-string data types to strings before passing them to the `_xg_characters` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `_export_xml_field` method:

```python
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif is_listlike(serialized_value):
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', str(value))  # Convert non-string types to strings
    else:
        self._xg_characters(str(serialized_value))  # Convert non-string types to strings
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```

By converting non-string data types to strings before passing them to the `_xg_characters` method, we ensure that the AttributeError is avoided and the XML export process can handle non-string data types correctly.
