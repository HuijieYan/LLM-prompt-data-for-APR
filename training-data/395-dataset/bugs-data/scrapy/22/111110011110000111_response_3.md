The error occurs because the `_xg_characters` function is trying to call the `decode` method on a boolean object, which does not have that method. This happens when the `serialized_value` is a non-string type, as in the test case provided.

To fix the bug, we need to handle non-string types appropriately in the `_export_xml_field` function by converting them to strings before attempting to call the `decode` method.

Here is the corrected code for the `_export_xml_field` function:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class XmlItemExporter(BaseItemExporter):
    # ... (other code) ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
        self.xg.startElement(name, {})
        if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
            for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
                self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
        elif is_listlike(serialized_value):
            for value in serialized_value:
                self._export_xml_field('value', value)
        else:
            self._xg_characters(str(serialized_value))
        self.xg.endElement(name)
```

In the corrected code, the `str` function is used to convert non-string types to strings before passing them to the `_xg_characters` function. This ensures that non-string types are handled properly and the `decode` method is not called on them.
