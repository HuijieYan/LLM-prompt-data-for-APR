The error occurs in the `_xg_characters` method within the `XmlItemExporter` class. The error message indicates that there is an attempt to decode a boolean value, which is not allowed because booleans do not have a `decode` method.

The reason for this bug is that the `_xg_characters` method is expecting only string-like values, and it is attempting to decode the value, assuming it is encoded using the `encoding` attribute. However, in this case, the value is a boolean, so it does not make sense to decode it.

To fix this bug, we need to handle non-string values differently in the `_export_xml_field` method and avoid calling the `_xg_characters` method with non-string values.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected _export_xml_field function
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif is_listlike(serialized_value):
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', value)
    elif isinstance(serialized_value, bool):
        self.xg.characters(str(serialized_value).lower())  # convert boolean to lowercase string
    else:
        self._xg_characters(serialized_value)
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```

In the corrected code, we added an `elif` condition to check if the `serialized_value` is a boolean. If it is, we use `self.xg.characters(str(serialized_value).lower())` to convert the boolean to a lowercase string representation and then write it to the XML. This will handle the boolean values correctly without attempting to decode them.
