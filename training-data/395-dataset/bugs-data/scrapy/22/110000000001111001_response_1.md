The error in the provided function is that "_xg_characters" is called instead of "self.xg.characters" in the else statement. This is causing the function to fail due to a NameError, as "_xg_characters" is not defined anywhere in the code.

The bug occurs because there is a typo in the function. The function is trying to call the "self.xg.characters" method to add character data to the XML, but it instead calls "_xg_characters", which does not exist.

To fix the bug, the function should call "self.xg.characters" instead of "_xg_characters" in the else statement.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif is_listlike(serialized_value):
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', value)
    else:
        self.xg.characters(str(serialized_value))
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```
