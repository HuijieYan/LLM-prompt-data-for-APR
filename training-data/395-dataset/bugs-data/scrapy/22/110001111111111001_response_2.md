Potential error location within the function: The error is occurring in the `_xg_characters` method, specifically in the line `serialized_value = serialized_value.decode(self.encoding)`. The error message indicates that it's trying to decode a boolean object, which is causing an AttributeError.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `_xg_characters` method is assuming that the `serialized_value` can always be decoded, which is not true for non-string types like boolean, integers, and floats. This assumption is leading to the AttributeError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the type of the `serialized_value` before attempting to decode it. If it's a boolean, integer, or float, handle it differently.
2. Use a try-except block to catch the AttributeError and handle it gracefully.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif is_listlike(serialized_value):
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', value)
    else:
        try:
            self._xg_characters(serialized_value)
        except AttributeError:
            self._xg_characters(str(serialized_value))
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```
