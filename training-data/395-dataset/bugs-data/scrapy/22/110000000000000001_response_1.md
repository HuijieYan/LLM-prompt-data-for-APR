Potential error location: The recursive call to `_export_xml_field` without properly handling the different types of `serialized_value` may cause issues.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The function does not properly handle different types of `serialized_value`, leading to potential errors or infinite recursive calls.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Check if `serialized_value` is a dictionary and iterate through its items, calling `_export_xml_field` for each pair.
- Check if `serialized_value` is list-like and iterate through its values, calling `_export_xml_field` for each value.
- If `serialized_value` is neither a dictionary nor list-like, handle it as a single value.

Corrected code:

```python
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if isinstance(serialized_value, dict):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif isinstance(serialized_value, (list, tuple)):
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field(name, value)
    else:
        self._xg_characters(serialized_value)
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```
