The error occurs when the function `_export_xml_field` encounters a non-string type, such as an integer or a boolean, and attempts to use the `decode` method on it, which is only applicable to string objects. This leads to the AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'decode'.

To fix this issue, the function needs to handle non-string types differently. The function should check the type of the serialized_value and handle it appropriately. For non-dictionary and non-listlike types, the function should directly add the serialized value to the XML element.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})

    if isinstance(serialized_value, dict):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif is_listlike(serialized_value):
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', value)
    else:
        self.xg.characters(str(serialized_value))

    self.xg.endElement(name)
```
