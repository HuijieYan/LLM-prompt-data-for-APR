The bug occurs in the `_export_xml_field` method of the `scrapy/exporters.py` file when trying to export items to XML, which have non-string types such as integer and boolean.

The error message indicates that the `_xg_characters` method is attempting to decode a non-string object, which is causing an AttributeError.

To fix this bug, we need to handle non-string types differently in the `_export_xml_field` method. We can modify the code to check the type of the `serialized_value` and handle it accordingly. For example, if the type is `int` or `bool`, we can convert it to a string before exporting it to XML.

Here's the corrected code for the `_export_xml_field` method:

```python
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif isinstance(serialized_value, (list, tuple)):
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', value)
    elif isinstance(serialized_value, (int, float, bool)):
        self._xg_characters(str(serialized_value))
    else:
        self._xg_characters(serialized_value)
    
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```

In this corrected code, we added a check for non-string types such as `int`, `float`, and `bool`. If the `serialized_value` is of any of these types, we convert it to a string using `str()` before passing it to `_xg_characters`.
