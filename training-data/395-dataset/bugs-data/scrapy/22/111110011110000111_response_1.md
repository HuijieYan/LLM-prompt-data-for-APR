The error message indicates that there's an AttributeError when trying to decode a non-string value. The error is occurring in the `_xg_characters` method, which is used to serialize non-string values.

The reason behind the bug is that the `_xg_characters` method attempts to decode non-string values using the `decode` method, which only works for string values. 

To fix the bug, the code should check the type of the serialized value and handle non-string types differently. For example, integer values should be converted to strings before being added to the XML, and boolean values should also be converted to strings.

Here's the corrected code for the `_export_xml_field` method:

```python
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif is_listlike(serialized_value):
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', str(value))  # Convert non-string types to string
    else:
        self._xg_characters(serialized_value)  # Handle boolean and other non-string types
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```

And here's the corrected code for the `_xg_characters` method:

```python
def _xg_characters(self, serialized_value):
    # Handle boolean and other non-string types by converting to string
    if isinstance(serialized_value, bool):
        self.xg.characters(str(serialized_value))
    else:
        self.xg.characters(serialized_value)  # For string values
```

With these changes, non-string values will be handled correctly, and the bug should be fixed.
