The issue seems to be related to the handling of non-string serializable types when exporting to XML in Scrapy.

The bug occurs in the `_export_xml_field` method of the `XmlItemExporter` class. The function is not handling non-string types properly. When a non-string type (e.g., boolean, int, datetime, float) is encountered, it should be appropriately serialized to a string before being written to the XML output.

To fix the bug, you can modify the `_export_xml_field` method to handle non-string types by converting them to strings before exporting them to the XML.

Here's the corrected code for the `_export_xml_field` method with the necessary changes:

```python
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'): # if it has items attribute, it is a dictionary
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif is_listlike(serialized_value): # if it is listlike, iterate over each value
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', value)
    else: # convert non-string values to string before exporting
        self._xg_characters(str(serialized_value))
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```

Now, the `serialized_value` is converted to a string using `str(serialized_value)` before being passed to `_xg_characters`. This modification ensures that non-string types are properly handled and serialized when exporting to XML.
