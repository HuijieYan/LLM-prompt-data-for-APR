The bug in the provided function is that it's referencing an undefined variable `to_native_str` and an undefined module `http`. This is causing the function to fail.

To fix this bug, the `to_native_str` function needs to be defined, and the `http` module needs to be imported. Also, the function should handle cases where the status code is not found in `http.RESPONSES`.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_17/scrapy/utils/response.py
import http

def response_status_message(status):
    """Return status code plus status text descriptive message

    >>> response_status_message(200)
    '200 OK'

    >>> response_status_message(404)
    '404 Not Found'
    """
    status_text = http.HTTPStatus(status).phrase
    return f"{status} {status_text}"
```

This corrected code brings in the `http` module and uses the `HTTPStatus` class to get the status text for the given status code. It also uses f-string formatting for improved readability.
