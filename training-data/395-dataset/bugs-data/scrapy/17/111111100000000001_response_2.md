Potential error location: The 'to_native_str' and 'http.RESPONSES' functions are not defined in the given code, so calling them will result in an error.

Reason for the bug: The code tries to use functions 'to_native_str' and 'http.RESPONSES' without importing them or defining them within the current scope, leading to a NameError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Import the necessary functions from the appropriate modules.
2. Define the functions within the current module if they are custom functions.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_17/scrapy/utils/response.py

from http.client import responses

def response_status_message(status):
    """Return status code plus status text descriptive message

    >>> response_status_message(200)
    '200 OK'

    >>> response_status_message(404)
    '404 Not Found'
    """
    return '%s %s' % (status, responses.get(int(status)))
```
