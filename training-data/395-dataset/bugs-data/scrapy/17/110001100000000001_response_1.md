The bug in the provided function is that it references an undefined variable 'http'. It seems that the function is trying to retrieve the description of the status code from a dictionary 'http.RESPONSES', but this dictionary has not been imported or defined within the function.

To fix this, we can import the 'http' module and use it to retrieve the status text from the 'http.RESPONSES' dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import http.client

# this is the corrected function
def response_status_message(status):
    """Return status code plus status text descriptive message

    >>> response_status_message(200)
    '200 OK'

    >>> response_status_message(404)
    '404 Not Found'
    """
    return '%s %s' % (status, http.client.responses.get(int(status), ''))
```
