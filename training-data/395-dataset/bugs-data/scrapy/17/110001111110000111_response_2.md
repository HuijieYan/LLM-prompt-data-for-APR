Potential error location in the code:
The error is occurring in the `to_native_str` function, which is called within the `response_status_message` function. It seems that the `to_native_str` function is receiving a `None` value for the `text` parameter, leading to the TypeError.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `http.RESPONSES.get(int(status))` call within the `response_status_message` function is returning a `None` value. This `None` value is then being passed to the `to_native_str` function, causing the error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `http.RESPONSES.get(int(status))` returns `None` and ensure that the `to_native_str` function does not receive a `None` value.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from scrapy import http

def response_status_message(status):
    """Return status code plus status text descriptive message

    >>> response_status_message(200)
    '200 OK'

    >>> response_status_message(404)
    '404 Not Found'
    """
    response_text = http.RESPONSES.get(int(status))
    if response_text:
        return f'{status} {response_text}'
    else:
        return f'{status} Unknown Status'
```

In the corrected code, we first store the response text in a variable `response_text` and then check if it's not `None`. If it's not `None`, we return the status code and response text. If it's `None`, we return the status code followed by "Unknown Status". This approach ensures that the `to_native_str` function does not receive a `None` value, fixing the bug.
