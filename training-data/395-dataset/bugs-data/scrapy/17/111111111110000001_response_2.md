The error occurs due to the function "to_native_str" being called with a None value for "text", which results in a TypeError. 

The bug in the code is the usage of "to_native_str" function without handling the case where the status code is not found in the http.RESPONSES dictionary.

To fix the bug, we can first check if the status code exists in the http.RESPONSES dictionary. If it does not exist, we can return a default message indicating an unknown status. This will prevent the "to_native_str" function from being called with a None value.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def response_status_message(status):
    """Return status code plus status text descriptive message

    >>> response_status_message(200)
    '200 OK'

    >>> response_status_message(404)
    '404 Not Found'
    """
    status_code = int(status)
    if status_code in http.RESPONSES:
        return '%s %s' % (status_code, to_native_str(http.RESPONSES[status_code]))
    else:
        return '%s Unknown Status' % (status_code)
```
