Potential Error:
The potential error in the provided function is the use of the 'to_native_str' and 'http.RESPONSES' without importing the necessary modules. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the status code is not found in the 'http.RESPONSES' dictionary.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the 'to_native_str' and 'http.RESPONSES' are not defined or imported within the function. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the status code is not found in the 'http.RESPONSES' dictionary, leading to potential KeyError.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
1. Import the required modules within the function.
2. Add a condition to handle cases where the status code is not found in the 'http.RESPONSES' dictionary.

Corrected Code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_17/scrapy/utils/response.py

# corrected function
import http

def response_status_message(status):
    """Return status code plus status text descriptive message

    >>> response_status_message(200)
    '200 OK'

    >>> response_status_message(404)
    '404 Not Found'
    """
    response = http.HTTPStatus(int(status))
    return '{} {}'.format(status, response.phrase)
```
