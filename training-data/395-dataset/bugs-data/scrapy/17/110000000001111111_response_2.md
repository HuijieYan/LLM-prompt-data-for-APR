The error in the provided function is due to the fact that the `http` module is not imported and `to_native_str` function is not defined. Additionally, the code is trying to use the `http.RESPONSES` dictionary without importing it from anywhere. As a result, the function will raise a NameError.

To fix the function, we need to import the necessary modules and define the `to_native_str` function. Since the `to_native_str` function is not provided, I will assume that it simply converts the input to a string.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import http

def response_status_message(status):
    """Return status code plus status text descriptive message

    >>> response_status_message(200)
    '200 OK'

    >>> response_status_message(404)
    '404 Not Found'
    """
    return f"{status} {http.client.responses.get(int(status), 'Unknown')}"
```

In this corrected code, we import the `http` module, which contains the `client` submodule and its `responses` dictionary. We use the `get` method of the dictionary to retrieve the status text, and also provide a default value of 'Unknown' in case the status is not found in the dictionary.
