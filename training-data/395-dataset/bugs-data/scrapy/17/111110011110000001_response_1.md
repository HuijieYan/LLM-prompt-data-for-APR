The error message indicates a TypeError occurring in the `to_native_str` function within the `response_status_message` function. The `to_native_str` function is trying to convert a NoneType object to unicode, which is causing the error.

The bug occurred because the `to_native_str` function is being called with the `RESPONSES` dictionary in the `to_native_str(http.RESPONSES.get(int(status)))` call. The `to_native_str` function expects a bytes, str, or unicode object, but it is receiving a NoneType object, leading to a TypeError.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `response_status_message` function to handle the case where the status code is not found in the `RESPONSES` dictionary. We can check if the status code exists in the dictionary and handle the case where it does not.

Here's the corrected code for the `response_status_message` function:
```python
def response_status_message(status):
    """Return status code plus status text descriptive message

    >>> response_status_message(200)
    '200 OK'

    >>> response_status_message(404)
    '404 Not Found'
    """
    response = http.RESPONSES.get(int(status))
    if response:
        return '%s %s' % (status, to_native_str(response))
    else:
        return '%s %s' % (status, 'Unknown Status')
```

By adding a check for the existence of the status code in the `RESPONSES` dictionary, we can avoid passing a NoneType object to the `to_native_str` function, fixing the bug.
