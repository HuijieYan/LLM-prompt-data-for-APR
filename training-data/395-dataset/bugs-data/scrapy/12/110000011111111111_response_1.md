The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the `response` and `text` arguments. 

The buggy function is not correctly handling the `response` and `text` arguments. It is trying to create a `response` from the `text` and then setting `text` from the `response`, which can result in both `response` and `text` being provided at the same time, leading to the error raised in the test function.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the `response` and `text` arguments separately. If `response` is provided, then `text` should be extracted from the response, and if `text` is provided, it should be used directly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
    st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

    if _root is not None:
        warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead", ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
        if root is None:
            root = _root
        else:
            warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

    if text is not None and response is None:
        response = _response_from_text(text, st)

    if response is not None:
        text = response.text
        kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

    self.response = response
    super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```

With this correction, the code will handle the `response` and `text` arguments separately, preventing the error raised in the test function.
