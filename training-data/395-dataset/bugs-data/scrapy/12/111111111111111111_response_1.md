The test case is attempting to verify that a `ValueError` is raised when both the `response` and `text` arguments are provided to the `Selector` class. The error message indicates that the `ValueError` was not raised as expected.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the constructor (`__init__`) method of the `Selector` class. It seems that the condition for checking both `response` and `text` arguments is not being handled correctly.

The bug occurs because the code does not properly handle the case where both `response` and `text` arguments are provided. The code currently allows both arguments to be passed, but it should raise a `ValueError` when both `response` and `text` are provided.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to add a check in the `__init__` method to raise a `ValueError` if both `response` and `text` arguments are provided.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
    st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

    if _root is not None:
        warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                      ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
        if root is None:
            root = _root
        else:
            warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

    if response is not None and text is not None:
        raise ValueError("Received both response and text. Please provide only one.")

    if text is not None:
        response = _response_from_text(text, st)

    if response is not None:
        text = response.text
        kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

    self.response = response
    super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```
