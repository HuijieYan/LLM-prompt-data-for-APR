The potential error in the provided code is that the `__init__` function is defined twice within the `Selector` class. This leads to a conflict as the second definition of `__init__` overrides the first one.

The reason behind this bug is that the `__init__` function is being redefined within the `Selector` class, and it is not considering the possibility of multiple definitions within the same class.

To fix the bug, we can remove the redundant definition of the `__init__` function and incorporate the logic from the duplicate definition into the existing `__init__` function. Additionally, the `super()` statement that calls the parent class `__init__` function should be updated to use the appropriate parent class.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
class Selector(_ParselSelector, object_ref):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
        st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

        if _root is not None:
            warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                          ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
            if root is None:
                root = _root
            else:
                warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

        if text is not None:
            response = _response_from_text(text, st)

        if response is not None:
            text = response.text
            kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

        self.response = response
        super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```
