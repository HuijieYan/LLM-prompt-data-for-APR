The test case is trying to check if a ValueError is raised when both response and text arguments are given to the Selector function. However, the test is failing because the ValueError is not being raised as expected.

The potential error location within the function is the way it handles the `response` and `text` arguments. The function should raise a ValueError if both `response` and `text` arguments are provided.

The bug occurred because the function did not have a check to raise a ValueError when both `response` and `text` arguments were provided.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check at the beginning of the function to raise a ValueError if both `response` and `text` arguments are provided. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
    if response is not None and text is not None:
        raise ValueError("Received both response and text. Only one of them should be provided.")

    st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

    if _root is not None:
        warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                      ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
        if root is None:
            root = _root
        else:
            warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

    if text is not None:
        response = _response_from_text(text, st)

    if response is not None:
        text = response.text
        kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

    self.response = response
    super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```
