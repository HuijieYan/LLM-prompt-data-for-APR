The error message from the test function indicates that a `ValueError` should be raised when both `response` and `text` are provided to the `Selector` function, but the test is not raising the expected error.

Looking at the buggy function, it seems that the issue lies in the `__init__` function of the `Selector` class. The `__init__` function is defined twice in the class, and the second definition is replacing the first one. This means that the second definition will override the first one, and the original behavior of the class is lost.

The reason for the bug is that the `__init__` function is being defined multiple times with different sets of parameters, resulting in the loss of the original behavior.

To fix the bug, the second definition of the `__init__` function should be removed, and the logic for handling `response` and `text` should be integrated into the original `__init__` function with proper validation and error handling.

Here is the corrected code for the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
    st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

    if response is not None and text is not None:
        raise ValueError('Received both response and text')  # raise an error if both response and text are provided

    if _root is not None:
        warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                      ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
        if root is None:
            root = _root
        else:
            warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

    if text is not None:
        response = _response_from_text(text, st)

    if response is not None:
        text = response.text
        kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

    self.response = response
    super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```

With these changes, the `__init__` function checks for the presence of both `response` and `text` and raises a `ValueError` if both are provided. Additionally, the original behavior of the class is preserved, and the error should be fixed.
