Potential Error Location:
The potential error location in the problematic function is likely the if statement `if text is not None:` where `response` is reassigned based on the value of `text`. This could potentially lead to the situation where both `response` and `text` are passed to the function, causing the ValueError to be raised in the test function.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where both `response` and `text` are provided as arguments. The function should be able to handle either `response` or `text`, not both.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
One possible approach to fix the bug is to modify the function to only accept either `response` or `text`, not both. This can be achieved by adding a check to ensure that only one of the two arguments is provided, and if both are provided, raise a ValueError.

Another approach would be to handle the case where both `response` and `text` are provided by prioritizing `response` over `text` if both are present, or vice versa. This can be achieved by reassigning the value of `response` only if `text` is not None.

Corrected Code:

```python
def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
    if response is not None and text is not None:
        raise ValueError("Cannot accept both response and text as arguments")
    st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

    if _root is not None:
        warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                      ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
        if root is None:
            root = _root
        else:
            warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

    if text is not None:
        response = _response_from_text(text, st)

    if response is not None:
        text = response.text
        kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

    self.response = response
    super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```
