Potential error location:
The issue seems to be with the usage of the variable _root and the conditional checks related to it.

Reason behind the bug:
The bug seems to be related to the conditional checks for the _root variable and the warnings related to its deprecation.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Use the root variable instead of _root if it is not None.
2. Handle the deprecation warnings appropriately.

Corrected code:

```python
def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
    st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

    if _root is not None:
        warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                      ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
        if root is None:
            root = _root
        else:
            warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

    if text is not None:
        response = _response_from_text(text, st)

    if response is not None:
        text = response.text
        kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

    self.response = response
    super(Selector, self).__init__(response=response, text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```
