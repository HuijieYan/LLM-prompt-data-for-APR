The error message from the test function indicates that the ValueError was not raised when the Selector function was called with both a response and text argument. This suggests that the condition to raise the ValueError is not being properly evaluated within the Selector function.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the if statement checking for the presence of both response and text arguments:

```python
if text is not None:
    response = _response_from_text(text, st)
```

The bug occurs because the condition to raise a ValueError when both response and text arguments are provided is not being correctly evaluated. The code within the if statement does not raise the ValueError when both arguments are present.

To fix the bug, the if statement should be modified to explicitly check for the presence of both response and text arguments and raise a ValueError if both are provided. Additionally, the code within the if statement should be adjusted to properly handle the response and text arguments.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
    st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

    if response is not None and text is not None:
        raise ValueError("received both response and text")

    if _root is not None:
        warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                      ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
        if root is None:
            root = _root
        else:
            warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

    if text is not None:
        response = _response_from_text(text, st)

    if response is not None:
        text = response.text
        kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

    self.response = response
    super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```
