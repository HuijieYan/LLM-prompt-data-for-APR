The issue in the provided code is that the `Selector` class is defining `__init__` method twice, which is causing a conflict. The buggy function is the second definition of `__init__` which is not necessary and causing an override of the first definition.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `Selector` class is redefining the `__init__` method without any need and not handling the `response`, `text`, `type`, `root`, and `_root` parameters correctly.

To fix this bug, the second definition of the `__init__` method should be removed and the logic from the second definition should be incorporated into the first one.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_12/scrapy/selector/unified.py

# class declaration containing the corrected function
class Selector(_ParselSelector, object_ref):
    def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
        st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

        if _root is not None:
            warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                          ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
            if root is None:
                root = _root
            else:
                warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

        if text is not None:
            response = _response_from_text(text, st)

        if response is not None:
            text = response.text
            kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

        self.response = response
        super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```
