The potential error in the given code is the incorrect use of the `super()` function. The `super()` function is used to call the method of a superclass, but in the given code, it is not used correctly.

The bug occurs because the `super()` function should be used with the class name and the instance of that class as arguments. This allows the method resolution order (MRO) to work correctly and access the superclass methods. In the given code, the `super()` function is not called with the correct arguments, which causes the bug.

To fix the bug, the `super()` function should be called with the class name and `self` as arguments.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class Selector:

    def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
        st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

        if _root is not None:
            warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                          ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
            if root is None:
                root = _root
            else:
                warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

        if text is not None:
            response = _response_from_text(text, st)

        if response is not None:
            text = response.text
            kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

        self.response = response
        super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```
