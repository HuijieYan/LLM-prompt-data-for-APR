The error message from the test function indicates that the ValueError was not raised when it was expected to be raised. This suggests that the buggy function is not functioning as intended and may not be properly checking for the received arguments.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional checks for the 'response' and 'text' arguments. The function is supposed to raise a ValueError if both 'response' and 'text' are received as arguments, but it seems to be failing to do so.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the conditional checks for 'response' and 'text' are not properly implemented, leading to incorrect behavior when both arguments are provided.

To fix the bug, the conditional checks for 'response' and 'text' need to be reviewed and corrected to ensure that a ValueError is raised when both arguments are provided.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
    st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)
    
    if _root is not None:
        warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                      ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
        if root is None:
            root = _root
        else:
            warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")
    
    if response is not None and text is not None:
        raise ValueError('received both response and text')
    
    if text is not None:
        response = _response_from_text(text, st)
    
    if response is not None:
        text = response.text
        kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)
    
    self.response = response
    super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
``` 

This corrected code includes a check for both 'response' and 'text' arguments and raises a ValueError if both are provided.
