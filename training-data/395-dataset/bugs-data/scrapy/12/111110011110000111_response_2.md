The test case is trying to create a Selector object using both a TextResponse and a text argument, which should raise a ValueError according to the test function.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `__init__` method of the Selector class. The bug is likely occurring because the `__init__` method is not checking for both `response` and `text` arguments being provided at the same time.

The bug occurs because the `__init__` method does not contain logic to check if both `response` and `text` arguments are being provided simultaneously. The current code does not raise a ValueError when both arguments are provided.

To fix the bug, the `__init__` method should include a check to raise a ValueError if both `response` and `text` arguments are provided. Additionally, the code should not rely on the deprecated `_root` argument, and simply use the `root` argument if both `_root` and `root` are provided.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
    if response and text:
        raise ValueError("Received both response and text")

    st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

    if _root is not None:
        warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                      ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
        if root is None:
            root = _root
        else:
            warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

    if text is not None:
        response = _response_from_text(text, st)

    if response is not None:
        text = response.text
        kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

    self.response = response
    super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```
