The test case "test_selector_bad_args" is trying to test the scenario where both a response and text are provided to the Selector function, but it fails to raise a ValueError as expected.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `__init__` method where the condition `if text is not None:` is not handling the case where both `response` and `text` are provided.

The bug occurs because the code does not check for the scenario where both `response` and `text` are provided to the `__init__` method. The current implementation only handles the case where one of them is provided.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition to ensure that if both `response` and `text` are provided, it should raise a ValueError.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# relative function's signature in this file
def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
    st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

    if _root is not None:
        warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                      ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
        if root is None:
            root = _root
        else:
            warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

    if response is not None and text is not None:
        raise ValueError("received both response and text")

    if text is not None:
        response = _response_from_text(text, st)

    if response is not None:
        text = response.text
        kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

    self.response = response
    super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```

With this change, the `__init__` method will now raise a ValueError if both `response` and `text` are provided, as expected by the test case.
