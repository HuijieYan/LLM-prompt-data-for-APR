The test case is attempting to initialize the Selector class with both a TextResponse object and a text argument. The error message indicates that the expected ValueError was not raised, which suggests that the buggy function is not properly handling the case where both response and text arguments are provided.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional checks and assignments for the response and text arguments.

The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle the case when both response and text arguments are provided. It should raise a ValueError in this case, but it currently does not.

One possible approach for fixing the bug would be to add a conditional check at the beginning of the function to ensure that only one of response or text can be provided, and raise a ValueError if both are provided.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
    if response is not None and text is not None:
        raise ValueError("Received both response and text. Only one of them should be provided.")

    st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

    if _root is not None:
        warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                      ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
        if root is None:
            root = _root
        else:
            warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

    if text is not None:
        response = _response_from_text(text, st)

    if response is not None:
        text = response.text
        kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

    self.response = response
    super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle the case where both response and text arguments are provided and will raise a ValueError as expected in the test case.
