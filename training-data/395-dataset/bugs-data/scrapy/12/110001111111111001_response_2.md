The test case "test_selector_bad_args" is trying to create a Selector object with both a TextResponse and text provided as arguments. The expectation is that a ValueError should be raised because both a response and text are being provided.

The potential error location in the problematic function is in the __init__ method. The problem is that the function is not properly handling the case where both response and text are provided as arguments.

The bug occurs because the function does not have a check for the case where both response and text are provided. Instead, it simply tries to create a Selector object without considering this case, which leads to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we can add a check in the __init__ method to raise a ValueError if both response and text are provided. This will ensure that the function handles this scenario correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
    if response is not None and text is not None:
        raise ValueError("Received both response and text")

    st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

    if _root is not None:
        warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                      ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
        if root is None:
            root = _root
        else:
            warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

    if text is not None:
        response = _response_from_text(text, st)

    if response is not None:
        text = response.text
        kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

    self.response = response
    super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```
