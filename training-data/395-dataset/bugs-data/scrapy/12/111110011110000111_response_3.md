The error message from the test function indicates that a ValueError should be raised when both the "response" and "text" parameters are provided to the Selector function. However, the ValueError is not being raised as expected, suggesting that there is a bug in the Selector class's __init__ method.

The potential error location is within the __init__ method of the Selector class. It appears that the logic to handle the "response" and "text" parameters is incorrect.

The bug occurs because the code does not handle the case where both "response" and "text" parameters are provided. The code only checks if "text" is not None and updates the "response" variable accordingly, but it doesn't handle the situation where both "response" and "text" are provided at the same time.

To fix the bug, the code needs to handle the case where both "response" and "text" are provided. It should raise a ValueError in this case, indicating that only one of them should be provided.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
    st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

    if _root is not None:
        warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                      ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
        if root is None:
            root = _root
        else:
            warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

    if response is not None and text is not None:
        raise ValueError("Only one of 'response' and 'text' should be provided")

    if text is not None:
        response = _response_from_text(text, st)

    if response is not None:
        text = response.text
        kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

    self.response = response
    super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```

In the corrected code, a ValueError is raised if both "response" and "text" are provided, and the rest of the logic remains the same.
