The error message from the test case indicates that the ValueError is not being raised when it should be.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic that checks if both `response` and `text` are provided as arguments. The error occurs due to the check for both `response` and `text` being provided, but the ValueError is not being raised when both are present.

The bug occurs because the function is not properly handling the case where both `response` and `text` are provided as arguments. The function should raise a ValueError when both `response` and `text` are not None.

To fix the bug, we should add a check to raise a ValueError when both `response` and `text` are provided. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected function
def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
        if response is not None and text is not None:
            raise ValueError('received both response and text')
        
        st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)
    
        if _root is not None:
            warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                          ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
            if root is None:
                root = _root
            else:
                warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")
    
        if text is not None:
            response = _response_from_text(text, st)
    
        if response is not None:
            text = response.text
            kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)
    
        self.response = response
        super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```
