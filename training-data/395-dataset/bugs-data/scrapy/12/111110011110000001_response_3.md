The test case is trying to create a Selector object with both a `TextResponse` and a `text` argument. The error message indicates that no ValueError was raised, which implies that the buggy function did not correctly handle the case where both `response` and `text` arguments are provided.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the part where it checks for the presence of both `response` and `text` arguments. It seems that the function does not raise a ValueError when both are provided, leading to the test case failure.

The bug likely occurred because the function did not properly handle the case where both `response` and `text` are provided. The function should raise a ValueError if both `response` and `text` are provided since they are mutually exclusive.

To fix the bug, we can add a check to raise a ValueError if both `response` and `text` are provided. This will ensure that the function enforces the correct usage of these arguments.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
    if response and text:
        raise ValueError("Only one of 'response' and 'text' should be provided")
    
    st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

    if _root is not None:
        warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                      ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
        if root is None:
            root = _root
        else:
            warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

    if text is not None:
        response = _response_from_text(text, st)

    if response is not None:
        text = response.text
        kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

    self.response = response
    super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```

With this correction, the function will raise a ValueError if both `response` and `text` are provided, ensuring that the usage of these arguments is handled correctly.
