The error message "ValueError not raised" indicates that the `ValueError` exception was not raised as expected when using the `Selector` class with the provided arguments. This means that the buggy function within the `Selector` class is not handling the arguments properly.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the way it handles the `response` and `text` arguments. It should not allow both `response` and `text` to be provided at the same time.

The bug occurred because the conditional checks for `response` and `text` did not properly handle the case where both were provided. As a result, the Selector class initialized with both `response` and `text`, leading to the failure of the test case.

To fix the bug, the conditional checks for `response` and `text` should be modified to handle the case where both are provided. One possible approach is to raise a `ValueError` when both `response` and `text` are provided.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
    if response is not None and text is not None:  # Check for both response and text
        raise ValueError("Received both response and text. Please provide only one.")

    st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

    if _root is not None:
        warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead", ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
        if root is None:
            root = _root
        else:
            warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

    if text is not None:
        response = _response_from_text(text, st)

    if response is not None:
        text = response.text
        kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

    self.response = response
    super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```
