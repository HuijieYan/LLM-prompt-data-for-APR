The bug in the given code is that there are two `__init__` methods defined in the `Selector` class, which is not allowed in Python. The second `__init__` method is overwriting the first one, making it inaccessible.

To fix this bug, the second `__init__` method should be removed, and its code should be merged into the first `__init__` method.

Additionally, it seems that the code is trying to handle deprecated parameters `_root` and `root`. The code is currently issuing warnings and handling the deprecated parameters, but there is no actual code to handle the `root` parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the `Selector` class:

```python
class Selector(_ParselSelector, object_ref):
    def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
        st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)
        
        if _root is not None:
            warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                          ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
            if root is None:
                root = _root
            else:
                warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")
        
        if text is not None:
            response = _response_from_text(text, st)
            
        if response is not None:
            text = response.text
            kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)
        
        self.response = response
        super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```

In this corrected code, the second `__init__` method has been removed, and the code from the second method has been merged into the first `__init__` method. Additionally, the code now handles the `root` parameter properly.
