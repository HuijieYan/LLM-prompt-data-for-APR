The error message indicates that the ValueError for receiving both response and text was not raised when running the test case.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic that checks for both response and text and sets the response or text accordingly. This logic seems to be causing the issue.

The bug occurs because the function incorrectly handles the case when both response and text are provided. It does not raise the ValueError when both are given.

One approach to fixing the bug is to add a condition to check if both response and text are provided, and if so, to raise a ValueError.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
    def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
        st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)
    
        if _root is not None:
            warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                          ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
            if root is None:
                root = _root
            else:
                warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")
    
        if response is not None and text is not None:
            raise ValueError('received both response and text')
    
        if text is not None:
            response = _response_from_text(text, st)
    
        if response is not None:
            text = response.text
            kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)
    
        self.response = response
        super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```
