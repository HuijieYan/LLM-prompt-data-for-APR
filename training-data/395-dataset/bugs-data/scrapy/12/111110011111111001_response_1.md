The bug in the provided code is that the `__init__` function is defined twice within the `Selector` class. This causes conflicts and confusion, as the class cannot have two `__init__` functions. 

The error message from the test function indicates that the ValueError is not being raised as expected, which suggests that the initialization of the `Selector` class is not functioning correctly.

To fix the bug, remove the duplicate `__init__` function and merge the functionality of both `__init__` functions into a single one. This will ensure that the `Selector` class is properly initialized with the correct parameters.

Here is the corrected code for the `Selector` class:

```python
class Selector(_ParselSelector, object_ref):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # merged functionality into a single __init__ function
    def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
        st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

        if _root is not None:
            warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead", ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
            if root is None:
                root = _root
            else:
                warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

        if text is not None:
            response = _response_from_text(text, st)

        if response is not None:
            text = response.text
            kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

        self.response = response
        super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```

With this corrected code, the `Selector` class has a single `__init__` function with the merged functionality, and the bug causing the ValueError not being raised in the test case should be fixed.
