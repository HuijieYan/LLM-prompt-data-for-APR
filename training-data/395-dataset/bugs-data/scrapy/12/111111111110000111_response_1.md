The error message indicates that the ValueError is not being raised as expected when the `Selector` function is called with both a `TextResponse` and `text`. This suggests that the conditional logic within the `Selector` function is not working as intended.

The potential error location within the `Selector` function is the check for `text` and `response`. It seems that the function is not properly handling the case where both `response` and `text` are provided.

The bug occurs because the conditional logic for handling the `response` and `text` arguments is not properly checking for the case where both are provided. As a result, the ValueError is not being raised when it should be.

To fix the bug, we can modify the conditional logic to explicitly handle the case where both `response` and `text` are provided, and raise a ValueError in that scenario.

Here's the corrected code for the `Selector` function:

```python
def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
    st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

    if _root is not None:
        warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                      ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
        if root is None:
            root = _root
        else:
            warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

    if response is not None and text is not None:
        raise ValueError("Received both response and text")

    if text is not None:
        response = _response_from_text(text, st)

    if response is not None:
        text = response.text
        kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

    self.response = response
    super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```

In this corrected code, the conditional logic has been modified to explicitly check for the case where both `response` and `text` are provided, and raise a ValueError in that scenario. This should resolve the issue described in the error message.
