The potential error in the given code is that the `__init__` function has been defined twice in the `Selector` class. This will lead to a method being overwritten by the second definition of `__init__`.

The bug occurred because the `__init__` function is being redefined and the initial parameters are being overridden without any logic or condition based on which it should be redefined.

To fix the bug, the second definition of the `__init__` function should be removed and the code for initializing the class should be included in the first `__init__` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `Selector` class:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class Selector(_ParselSelector, object_ref):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # signature of the corrected __init__ function in this class
    def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
        st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)
    
        if _root is not None:
            warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                          ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
            if root is None:
                root = _root
            else:
                warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")
    
        if text is not None:
            response = _response_from_text(text, st)
    
        if response is not None:
            text = response.text
            kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)
    
        self.response = response
        super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```
