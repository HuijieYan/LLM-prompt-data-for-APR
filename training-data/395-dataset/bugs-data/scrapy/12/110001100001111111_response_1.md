The potential error in the `__init__` function is that it is using the `super()` function incorrectly. The intention seems to be to call the `__init__` method of the parent class (Selector), but the current implementation is incorrect.

It appears that the intention is to initialize the Selector object with the provided parameters, including `response`, `text`, `type`, `root`, and other keyword arguments. However, the way the `super()` function is used is incorrect and may cause issues.

To fix the bug, the correct usage of `super()` should be utilized to call the `__init__` method of the parent class (Selector), passing the required arguments to it while handling the deprecated arguments and warnings.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
    st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

    if _root is not None:
        warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                      ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
        if root is None:
            root = _root
        else:
            warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

    if text is not None:
        response = _response_from_text(text, st)

    if response is not None:
        text = response.text
        kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

    self.response = response
    super().__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```

In the corrected code, the `super()` function is used without explicitly passing `self` and the required arguments are passed to the parent class's `__init__` method.
