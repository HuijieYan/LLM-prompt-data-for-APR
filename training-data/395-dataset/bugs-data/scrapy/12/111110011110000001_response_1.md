Potential Error Location:
The error seems to be related to the `Selector` class not raising a `ValueError` when both `response` and `text` are provided as arguments.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `__init__` method of the `Selector` class is not handling the case where both `response` and `text` are provided as arguments. This causes the test case to fail as it expects a `ValueError` to be raised in this scenario.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
We can fix the bug by adding a check in the `__init__` method to raise a `ValueError` when both `response` and `text` are provided as arguments.

Corrected Code:
```python
def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
    if response is not None and text is not None:
        raise ValueError('received both response and text')

    st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

    if _root is not None:
        warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                      ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
        if root is None:
            root = _root
        else:
            warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

    if text is not None:
        response = _response_from_text(text, st)

    if response is not None:
        text = response.text
        kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

    self.response = response
    super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```
