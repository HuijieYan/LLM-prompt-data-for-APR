The error message from the test function indicates that a ValueError is not being raised when the Selector class is called with both a TextResponse and a text argument. This suggests that there is a problem with the initialization of the Selector class when both response and text arguments are provided.

The potential error location within the __init__ method of the Selector class is where the response and text arguments are being processed.

The bug occurs because the initialization of the Selector class does not handle the case where both response and text arguments are provided. The current code does not check for this condition and does not raise a ValueError as expected in the test case.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to the __init__ method to raise a ValueError if both response and text arguments are provided. We can use an if statement to check if both response and text are not None, and if so, raise a ValueError to indicate that both cannot be provided at the same time.

Here's the corrected code for the __init__ method of the Selector class:

```python
def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
    if response is not None and text is not None:
        raise ValueError("received both response and text")
        
    st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

    if _root is not None:
        warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                      ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
        if root is None:
            root = _root
        else:
            warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

    if text is not None:
        response = _response_from_text(text, st)

    if response is not None:
        text = response.text
        kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

    self.response = response
    super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```

With this correction, the __init__ method will now raise a ValueError if both response and text arguments are provided, as expected in the test case.
