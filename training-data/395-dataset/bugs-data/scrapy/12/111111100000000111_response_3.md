The potential error in the provided code is that the `__init__` function is defined twice within the `Selector` class, which will result in the second definition overwriting the first one. This means that the code inside the second `__init__` function will be executed, and the code inside the first `__init__` function will never be executed.

The reason behind the bug is that the code is trying to define the `__init__` function twice in the `Selector` class, which is not allowed in Python. This will result in the second definition overwriting the first one.

To fix the bug, the second `__init__` function should be removed, and the code inside the first `__init__` function should be included in the remaining `__init__` function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class Selector(_ParselSelector, object_ref):
    # ... other code ...
    
    # corrected __init__ function
    def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
        st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)
    
        if _root is not None:
            warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                          ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
            if root is None:
                root = _root
            else:
                warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")
    
        if text is not None:
            response = _response_from_text(text, st)
    
        if response is not None:
            text = response.text
            kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)
    
        self.response = response
        super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```
