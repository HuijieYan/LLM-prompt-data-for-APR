The test case `test_selector_bad_args` is trying to create a Selector object using both `TextResponse` and `text` arguments. The error message indicates that the `ValueError` is not being raised when it should be.

The buggy function `__init__` is accepting `response` and `text` arguments, and the bug seems to be related to how these arguments are being handled. It looks like the function is not properly checking for both `response` and `text` being provided, which causes the test case to fail.

The bug occurs because the function is not properly handling the case when both `response` and `text` arguments are provided. The condition to check for both arguments and raise a `ValueError` seems to be missing.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check for both `response` and `text` arguments being provided, and raise a `ValueError` if that is the case. Additionally, we can remove the existing `__init__` method and rename the other `__init__` method with a more descriptive name.

Here's the corrected code:
```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class Selector(_ParselSelector, object_ref):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def _init(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def _root(self):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # this is the corrected function
    def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
        if response is not None and text is not None:
            raise ValueError("received both response and text")

        st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

        if _root is not None:
            warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                          ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
            if root is None:
                root = _root
            else:
                warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

        if text is not None:
            response = _response_from_text(text, st)

        if response is not None:
            text = response.text
            kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

        self.response = response
        super(Selector, self)._init(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```
