Potential error location: The bug is likely occurring in the __init__ method of the Selector class, where the response and text parameters are being used.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: 
1. The _st function is being called with the response and type parameters, but the _st function is not defined in the provided code, so this will result in a NameError.
2. The _response_from_text function is being called with the text and st parameters, but this function is also not defined in the provided code, so this will result in a NameError.
3. The super() function is being called with the wrong parameters, as it should be using the __init__ method of the superclass instead of Selector.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define the missing _st and _response_from_text functions, if they are meant to be custom functions for this class.
2. Use the correct parameters in the super() function call, and ensure that the super() function is being used correctly to call the superclass's __init__ method.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_12/scrapy/selector/unified.py

class Selector:
    def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
        if response is not None:
            self.response = response
            text = response.text
            kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

        if type is not None:
            st = type
        else:
            st = self._default_type

        if _root is not None:
            import warnings
            warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                          DeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
            if root is None:
                root = _root
            else:
                warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

        super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)

    # other methods...
