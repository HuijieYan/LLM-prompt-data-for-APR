The error message indicates that the ValueError should have been raised but it wasn't. This means that the buggy function `__init__` is not properly handling the arguments `response` and `text`.

The potential error is within the condition where `text` is not None. The code does not properly handle the case where both `response` and `text` are provided.

The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle the case when both `response` and `text` arguments are provided. The function should raise a ValueError if both arguments are provided, rather than ignoring one of them.

To fix the bug, we can add a check for both `response` and `text` in the `__init__` function and raise a ValueError if both are provided.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
    if response is not None and text is not None:
        raise ValueError("Received both response and text, only one is allowed")
    
    st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

    if _root is not None:
        warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                      ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
        if root is None:
            root = _root
        else:
            warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

    if text is not None:
        response = _response_from_text(text, st)

    if response is not None:
        text = response.text
        kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

    self.response = response
    super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```
