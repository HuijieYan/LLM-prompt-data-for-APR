# Corrected function

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_12/scrapy/selector/unified.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def _st(response, st):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def _response_from_text(text, st):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, **kwargs):
    st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

    if text is not None:
        response = _response_from_text(text, st)

    if response is not None:
        text = response.text
        kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

    super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```

The corrected function removes the unnecessary _root argument and updates the function signature to remove it as well. This should fix the error that was occurring in the test function.
