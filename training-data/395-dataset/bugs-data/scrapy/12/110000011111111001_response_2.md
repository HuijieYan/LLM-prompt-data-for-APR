The error message indicates that the ValueError is not raised when it is expected in the test case `test_selector_bad_args`. The problem is likely to be in the Selector class initialization function.

The potential error location is within the `__init__` method of the Selector class.

The bug occurs because the `__init__` method allows both `response` and `text` arguments to be passed, and the test case expects a ValueError to be raised when both are provided.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `__init__` method to raise a ValueError when both `response` and `text` are provided.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
    if response is not None and text is not None:
        raise ValueError('received both response and text')

    st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

    if _root is not None:
        warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                      ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
        if root is None:
            root = _root
        else:
            warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

    if text is not None:
        response = _response_from_text(text, st)

    if response is not None:
        text = response.text
        kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

    self.response = response
    super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```
