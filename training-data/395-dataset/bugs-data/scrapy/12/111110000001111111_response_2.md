Potential issue:
The problem lies in the duplicate definition of the `__init__` method. In Python, each class should only have one `__init__` method, which serves as the constructor for the class. The second `__init__` method in the code is causing the issue.

Reason for the bug:
The error occurs because of the duplicate definition of the `__init__` method, which is not allowed in Python. This causes confusion for the interpreter and can lead to unexpected behavior.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the duplicate `__init__` method needs to be removed, and its functionality should be merged into the original `__init__` method. This can be achieved by incorporating the conditionals and logic from the duplicate method into the original `__init__` method.

Corrected code:
```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class Selector(_ParselSelector, object_ref):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # corrected __init__ method
    def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
        st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

        if _root is not None:
            warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                          ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
            if root is None:
                root = _root
            else:
                warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

        if text is not None:
            response = _response_from_text(text, st)

        if response is not None:
            text = response.text
            kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

        self.response = response
        super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```
