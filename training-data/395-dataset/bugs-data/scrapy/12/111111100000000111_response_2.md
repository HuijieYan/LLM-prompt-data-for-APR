The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of the same function signature twice in the class Selector. This is causing confusion and the proper initialization of the class is not being done.

The bug occurred because the Selector class has the same __init__ function defined twice, which overrides the first definition. This can cause unexpected behavior and errors when trying to instantiate the Selector class.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the second definition of the __init__ function in the Selector class and consolidate its functionality into the first definition.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_12/scrapy/selector/unified.py

# corrected class declaration containing the fixed function
class Selector(_ParselSelector, object_ref):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # corrected signature of the function in this class
    def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
        st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)
    
        if _root is not None:
            warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                          ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
            if root is None:
                root = _root
            else:
                warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")
    
        if text is not None:
            response = _response_from_text(text, st)
    
        if response is not None:
            text = response.text
            kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)
    
        self.response = response
        super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```
