Potential error location: The bug is likely located in the `__init__` method of the `Selector` class. The bug occurs when the `Selector` class is initialized with both a `response` and `text` argument.

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs because the code does not handle the case where both `response` and `text` arguments are provided at the same time. The code only checks if `text` is not None and assigns the `response` argument based on the provided `text`, without considering the case where both arguments are provided simultaneously.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add a check at the beginning of the `__init__` method to raise a `ValueError` if both `response` and `text` arguments are provided.
2. Restructure the logic to handle the case where both `response` and `text` arguments are given.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
    if response is not None and text is not None:
        raise ValueError('received both response and text')

    st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

    if _root is not None:
        warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead", ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
        if root is None:
            root = _root
        else:
            warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

    if text is not None:
        response = _response_from_text(text, st)

    if response is not None:
        text = response.text
        kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

    self.response = response
    super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```
