The test case is trying to create a `Selector` object using both a `response` and `text` argument, and it expects a `ValueError` to be raised. However, the error message indicates that the `ValueError` was not raised, suggesting that the buggy function is not working as expected.

The potential error in the buggy function occurs in the conditional logic for handling the `response` and `text` arguments. It seems that the function is not correctly checking for the presence of both `response` and `text` arguments.

The bug occurs because the function is not properly handling the case where both `response` and `text` arguments are provided. The logic to raise a `ValueError` when both are present is missing.

To fix the bug, the function needs to include a check for both `response` and `text` arguments and raise a `ValueError` if both are provided. Additionally, the function should be refactored to handle the arguments consistently and correctly.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# corrected function
def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
    if response is not None and text is not None:
        raise ValueError("Received both response and text")

    st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

    if _root is not None:
        warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                      ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
        if root is None:
            root = _root
        else:
            warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

    if text is not None:
        response = _response_from_text(text, st)

    if response is not None:
        text = response.text
        kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

    self.response = response
    super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```

With this correction, the function will properly check for the presence of both `response` and `text` arguments and raise a `ValueError` as expected.
