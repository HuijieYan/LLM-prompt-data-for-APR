The error message indicates that a `ValueError` was expected to be raised when calling the `Selector` function with both `TextResponse` and `text` arguments. However, the `ValueError` was not raised, leading to the test failure.

The potential error location within the problematic `Selector` function is in the conditional block where it checks if both `response` and `text` arguments are provided. It seems that the function is not correctly raising a `ValueError` when both arguments are provided.

The reason behind this bug is that the function is not properly handling the case when both `response` and `text` arguments are provided. Instead of raising a `ValueError`, it tries to proceed with the logic, leading to unexpected behavior.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to add an explicit check at the beginning of the `__init__` function to raise a `ValueError` if both `response` and `text` arguments are provided. This check will ensure that the function fails early when it receives conflicting arguments.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic `Selector` function:

```python
class Selector(_ParselSelector, object_ref):
    # ... omitted code ...
    
    # corrected implementation of the __init__ function
    def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
        if response is not None and text is not None:
            raise ValueError("Received both response and text. Use only one of them.")
        
        st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

        if _root is not None:
            warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                          ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
            if root is None:
                root = _root
            else:
                warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

        if text is not None:
            response = _response_from_text(text, st)

        if response is not None:
            text = response.text
            kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

        self.response = response
        super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```
