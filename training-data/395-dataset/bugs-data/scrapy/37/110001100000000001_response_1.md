The potential error location within the problematic function is the check for whether the URL has a scheme (e.g., http, https).

The bug occurs because the function is not correctly checking for the presence of a scheme in the URL before setting it. This can lead to malformed URLs being set as the request URL.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure that the URL has a scheme before setting it. We can use Python's urlparse module to achieve this.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse

def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)
    
    parsed_url = urlparse(url)
    if parsed_url.scheme == '':
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % url)
    
    s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)
    self._url = escape_ajax(s)
```

By using urlparse, we can check if the URL has a scheme and raise a ValueError if it doesn't. This ensures that the request URL is properly formatted with a scheme.
