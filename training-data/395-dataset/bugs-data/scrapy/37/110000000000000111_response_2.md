The test case provided tries to create a `Request` object with an invalid URL `invalid_url` and expects an error to be raised, but instead, the request is silently ignored without any error message. This behavior indicates that the `_set_url` method, which is responsible for setting the URL for the request, might not be correctly handling the validation and raising errors for invalid URLs.

The potential error location within the `_set_url` method is the validation check for the presence of a scheme in the URL. The current implementation uses the condition `if ':' not in self._url` to check for the presence of a scheme in the URL, but this is not a reliable method to validate the URL.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the current implementation of the `_set_url` method does not effectively handle invalid URLs, and it fails to raise appropriate errors when encountering such cases.

To fix the bug, we need to improve the URL validation mechanism within the `_set_url` method. We can use Python's `urlparse` to parse the URL and then check if it has a scheme. If the scheme is not present, we can raise a `ValueError` indicating the missing scheme in the request URL.

Here's the corrected code for the `_set_url` method:

```python
import six
from scrapy.utils.url import safe_url_string, escape_ajax
from urllib.parse import urlparse

def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)

    parsed_url = urlparse(url)
    if not parsed_url.scheme:
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % url)

    s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)
    self._url = escape_ajax(s)
```

In this corrected implementation, we first parse the URL using `urlparse` and then check if it has a scheme. If the scheme is not present, we raise a `ValueError` indicating the missing scheme in the request URL. This will ensure that invalid URLs are properly handled and appropriate errors are raised.
