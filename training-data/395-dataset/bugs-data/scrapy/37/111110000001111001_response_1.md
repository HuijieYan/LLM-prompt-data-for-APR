Potential error location: 
The error in the code is likely occurring in the _set_url function because it is checking if the input url is of type string, and then processing the url.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the code is attempting to use the `safe_url_string` and `escape_ajax` functions without defining them or importing them.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Import the necessary functions (`safe_url_string` and `escape_ajax`) from the appropriate module.
2. Ensure that the `encoding` function is properly defined within the class.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import six # assuming six is needed for string_types

# class declaration containing the fixed function
class Request:
    # ... omitted code ...

    # signature of the fixed function in this class
    def encoding(self):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # this is the fixed function
    def _set_url(self, url):
        if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
            raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)

        s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding) # assuming safe_url_string is imported
        self._url = escape_ajax(s)  # assuming escape_ajax is imported

        if ':' not in self._url:
            raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % self._url)
