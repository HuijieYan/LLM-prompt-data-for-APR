The error message from the test function "test_url_no_scheme" indicates that the ValueError was not raised by the Request for the input '/foo:bar'. This means that the function is not correctly validating the input URL to check for the presence of a scheme.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement which checks for the presence of a colon ':' in the URL. This condition is meant to identify if the URL contains a scheme, but it is failing to do so.

The bug occurs because the function is not correctly checking for the scheme in the URL. It simply looks for the presence of a colon ':' and raises a ValueError if it is not found.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly check for the scheme in the URL and raise a ValueError if it is missing. This can be achieved by using the `urlparse` module from Python's standard library to parse the URL and then check if it has a scheme.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse

# corrected function to set URL
def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)

    parsed_url = urlparse(url)
    if not parsed_url.scheme:
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % url)

    s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)
    self._url = escape_ajax(s)
```

With this modification, the function now correctly checks for the presence of a scheme in the URL and raises a ValueError if it is missing. This should address the bug and ensure that the test case "test_url_no_scheme" passes without any AssertionError.
