The error message from the test function indicates that the ValueError is not being raised when creating a Request object with an invalid URL.

The issue lies in the `_set_url` method where it expects a URL with a scheme (e.g., 'http://'). If the URL passed to the method does not contain a scheme, a ValueError should be raised. However, the current implementation does not handle this case correctly.

To fix the bug, a check needs to be added to ensure that the URL passed to the `_set_url` method contains a scheme. If it doesn't, a ValueError should be raised.

Here's the corrected code for the `_set_url` method:
```python
def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, str):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str, got %s' % type(url).__name__)

    if '://' not in url:
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % url)

    s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)
    self._url = escape_ajax(s)
```

With this correction, the _set_url method now correctly checks for the presence of a scheme in the URL and raises a ValueError if it's missing. This will ensure that an invalid URL without a scheme will be caught and an appropriate error will be raised.
