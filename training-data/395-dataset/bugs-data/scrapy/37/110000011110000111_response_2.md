1. The test case `test_url_no_scheme` is checking if a `ValueError` is raised when the `request_class` is initialized with invalid URLs that do not contain a scheme. The third `assertRaises` call is failing, indicating that the `ValueError` is not being raised when it should be.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement `if ':' not in self._url:`. This is where the function checks if the URL contains a scheme, and if not, it raises a `ValueError`.

3. The bug is occurring because the function does not correctly identify URLs without a scheme and raise a `ValueError` for them. As a result, invalid URLs are getting through without raising an error.

4. One possible approach for fixing the bug is to update the conditional statement to check for the presence of a scheme at the beginning of the URL. Additionally, the type check for the `url` parameter could be improved for better compatibility.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import six
from urllib.parse import urlparse

def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, (str, six.text_type)):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)

    parsed_url = urlparse(url)
    if not parsed_url.scheme:
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % url)

    self._url = url
```

In the corrected code, we use `urlparse` to parse the URL and then check if it has a scheme. If not, we raise a `ValueError` with the appropriate message. Additionally, we update the type check for the `url` parameter to be more inclusive.
