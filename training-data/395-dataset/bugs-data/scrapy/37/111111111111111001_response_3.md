Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the `_set_url` function within the `Request` class.

Reason for the bug: The bug is likely caused by the fact that the function `_set_url` is not correctly handling URLs without a scheme (e.g., 'foo:bar').

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The `_set_url` function needs to be updated to handle URLs without a scheme correctly. This can be achieved by adding a condition to check for the presence of the scheme in the URL before performing further actions.

Corrected code:

```python
def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)

    if not urlparse(url).scheme:
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % url)

    s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)
    self._url = escape_ajax(s)
```
