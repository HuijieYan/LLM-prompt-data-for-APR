The error message from the test function indicates that the `ValueError` is not being raised when the `request_class` is called with the URL '/foo:bar'.

The potential error location within the `_set_url` method is the line `if ':' not in self._url`. This condition is checking if the URL contains a colon (':'), which typically indicates the presence of a scheme (e.g., http:// or https://). If the colon is not present, it raises a `ValueError`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the condition `if ':' not in self._url` is checking the wrong variable. It should be checking the original URL `url` instead of the processed URL `self._url`.

To fix the bug, we need to change the condition to `if ':' not in url`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_set_url` method:

```python
def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)
    
    s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)
    self._url = escape_ajax(s)
    
    if ':' not in url:
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % url)
```

With this correction, the test cases for URLs without a scheme, such as '/foo' and '/foo/', will raise a `ValueError` as expected.
