The error message is indicating that the 'ValueError' was not raised by the 'Request' in the test_url_no_scheme test case.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the if statement that checks if ':' is in the URL. If ':' is not in the URL, it raises a ValueError.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the condition for checking the presence of a scheme in the URL is incorrect. It is assuming that the presence of ':' indicates the existence of a scheme, which is not always true.

To fix the bug, we should use a more robust method to check for the scheme in the URL. We can use urlparse from the urllib.parse module to parse the URL and then check if it has a scheme.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse

def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, str):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)

    parsed_url = urlparse(url)
    if not parsed_url.scheme:
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % url)

    self._url = url  # Assign the original URL as there is no issue with it
```

In the corrected code, we validate the URL by parsing it using urlparse and then checking if it has a scheme or not. If it doesn't have a scheme, we raise a ValueError. If it has a scheme, we assign the original URL to self._url.
