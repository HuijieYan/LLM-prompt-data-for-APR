The error occurs because the `_set_url` function in the `Request` class does not raise a `ValueError` when an invalid url without a scheme is provided. This causes the test `test_url_no_scheme` to fail because the `ValueError` is not being raised as expected.

The potential error location is the missing check for the scheme in the provided URL.

The reason for the bug is that the function does not validate whether the provided URL has a scheme (e.g., "http://") before setting it as the `_url` attribute.

To fix the bug, add a check to ensure that the URL provided includes a scheme before setting it as the `_url` attribute. If the scheme is missing, raise a `ValueError` indicating that the request URL is missing the scheme.

Here's the corrected code for the `_set_url` function:

```python
def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)

    s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)

    # Check if the URL includes a scheme
    if ':' not in s:
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % s)

    self._url = escape_ajax(s)
```

This corrected code will ensure that the `_set_url` function checks for the presence of a scheme in the provided URL and raises a `ValueError` if the scheme is missing.
