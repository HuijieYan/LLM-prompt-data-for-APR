1. The test case is checking whether the `ValueError` is properly raised when an invalid URL without a scheme is passed to the `request_class` function.

2. The potential error in the problematic function is the condition `if ':' not in self._url:`. This condition is checking for the presence of a colon, which is a check for the scheme in the URL.

3. The bug occurs because the function incorrectly assumes that a valid URL must contain a scheme. However, there are cases where a URL does not contain a scheme (e.g., '/foo/') and should not raise a `ValueError`.

4. To fix the bug, the condition checking for the scheme in the URL should be modified. Instead of raising a `ValueError` when no scheme is found, the function should handle URLs without a scheme as a valid input.

5. Corrected code for the `_set_url` function:

```python
def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)

    s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)
    self._url = escape_ajax(s)

    # Remove the condition checking for the presence of a scheme in the URL
```
