The error message is indicating that the `ValueError` is not being raised by the `Request` class when the URL does not contain a scheme.

Upon analyzing the function `_set_url`, it seems like the bug is located in the `if ':' not in self._url` condition. This condition is checking whether the URL contains a scheme, and if it doesn't, it raises a `ValueError`.

The reason for the bug is that the function `escape_ajax` might be modifying the URL in such a way that it removes the scheme. This is causing the condition to raise a `ValueError` even when the URL originally had a scheme.

To fix the bug, one possible approach is to ensure that the function `escape_ajax` does not remove the scheme from the URL. Another approach could be to modify the condition itself to check for the presence of a valid scheme in the URL before raising the `ValueError`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_set_url` method:

```python
import six

def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)

    s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)
    self._url = escape_ajax(s)

    if not self._url.startswith(('http://', 'https://', 'ftp://')):
        raise ValueError('Missing or invalid scheme in request url: %s' % self._url)
```

In the corrected code, the condition `if ':' not in self._url` has been replaced with a condition that checks if the URL starts with a valid scheme (http://, https://, or ftp://). This ensures that the `ValueError` is only raised when the URL does not contain a valid scheme.
