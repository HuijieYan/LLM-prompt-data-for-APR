Potential Error Location: 
The potential error is occurring in the _set_url function where the type of the url is being checked and processed.

Reason behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because the isinstance() function is being used to check if the url is a string type, but the code is also checking for unicode type separately. This can cause issues because isinstance() will return False for unicode strings in Python 3, leading to a TypeError being raised even if the url is a valid unicode string.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we can update the type checking to support both string and unicode types. Additionally, we can ensure that the encoding method is being called correctly to handle unicode strings.

Corrected Code:
```python
import six

class Request(object_ref):
    # ... omitted code ...


    def encoding(self):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass



    def _set_url(self, url):
        if not isinstance(url, (six.string_types)):  # Update type checking to support both string and unicode types
            raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)
    
        s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding())  # Ensure the encoding method is called correctly
        self._url = escape_ajax(s)
    
        if ':' not in self._url:
            raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % self._url)
```
