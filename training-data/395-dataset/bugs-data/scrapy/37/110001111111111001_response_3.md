Potential Error Location:
The error seems to occur in the `_set_url` method of the request class. The `self._url` is being set incorrectly when the `url` does not contain a scheme.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function `_set_url` does not handle the case where the `url` does not contain a scheme. This results in the incorrect setting of `self._url`, leading to the ValueError not being raised as expected.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `_set_url` method to check for the presence of a scheme in the URL and handle it accordingly.
2. Update the test case to ensure that the ValueError is raised in all relevant scenarios.

Corrected Code:

```python
def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, str):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str, got %s' % type(url).__name__)
    
    if ':' not in url:
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % url)
    
    self._url = url
```
In this corrected code, the `_set_url` method first checks if the `url` is a string and then checks if it contains a scheme. If the scheme is missing, it raises a ValueError. This should ensure that the error is handled correctly, and the test case should pass without any AssertionErrors.
