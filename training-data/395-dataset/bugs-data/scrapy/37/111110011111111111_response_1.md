The test function 'test_url_no_scheme' is trying to create a request using an invalid URL '/foo:bar' and expecting a ValueError to be raised. However, the current implementation of the '_set_url' function does not handle this case properly, which leads to the AssertionError in the test.

The potential error location is within the '_set_url' function where the validation for the presence of a scheme in the URL is not done correctly.

The bug occurs because the URL validation in the '_set_url' function does not account for cases where the URL is missing a scheme (e.g., 'http', 'https', etc.).

To fix the bug, we should update the '_set_url' function to properly check for the presence of a scheme in the URL and raise a ValueError if it is missing.

Here's the corrected code for the '_set_url' function:

```python
def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, str):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str, got %s' % type(url).__name__)

    if '://' not in url:
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % url)

    self._url = url
```

In this corrected version, we first check if the URL is a string, and then we verify if it contains '://', which is indicative of a valid scheme. If '://' is not present, we raise a ValueError with the URL that is missing the scheme.

This fix ensures that the '_set_url' function performs the correct validation for the URL and raises an appropriate error when the scheme is missing.
