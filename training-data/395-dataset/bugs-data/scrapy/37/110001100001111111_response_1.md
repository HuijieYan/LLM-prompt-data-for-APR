The potential error location within the problematic function is the `_set_url` method, specifically in the line `if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):`. The error occurs because the function is not properly checking for the data type of the URL before processing it, leading to unexpected behavior when an invalid URL is provided.

To fix the bug, the function should have proper input validation to ensure that only valid URLs are processed. This can be achieved by utilizing Python's built-in validation methods or libraries like `validators` to check the validity of the URL before further processing.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _set_url(self, url):
    if not validators.url(url):
        raise ValueError('Invalid URL: %s' % url)
    
    s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)
    self._url = escape_ajax(s)
    
    if ':' not in self._url:
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % self._url)
```

The updated code now first checks if the URL is valid using the `validators.url` function, and if it's not valid, it raises a `ValueError` with an appropriate error message. This ensures that only valid URLs are processed, and invalid URLs will be caught and handled properly.
