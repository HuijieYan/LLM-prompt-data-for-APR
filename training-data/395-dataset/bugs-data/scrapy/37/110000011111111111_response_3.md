The test case 'test_url_no_scheme' is trying to create a request using a URL without a scheme (http, https, ftp, etc.), which should raise a ValueError according to the test case.

The potential error in the function is the following condition:
```python
if ':' not in self._url:
    raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % self._url)
```

The reason behind the bug is that the function is not properly handling URLs without a scheme. It should raise a ValueError if the URL does not contain a valid scheme.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly handle URLs without a scheme. We can check for the presence of a scheme in the URL before attempting to use it.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import six
from urllib.parse import urlparse

def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)

    parsed_url = urlparse(url)
    if not parsed_url.scheme:
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % url)

    s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)
    self._url = escape_ajax(s)
```

This fix includes using Python's `urlparse` function to check for the presence of a scheme in the URL. If the scheme is missing, it raises a ValueError.
