Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the `if ':' not in self._url` condition, where the function is checking for the presence of a colon in the url.

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs because the function is not handling the case where the url is empty or does not contain a colon, leading to the ValueError being raised.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Check for the presence of a colon in the url only if the url is not empty.

Corrected code:

```python
def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)

    if url:
        s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)
        self._url = escape_ajax(s)

        if ':' not in self._url:
            raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % self._url)
    else:
        raise ValueError('Empty request url')
```
