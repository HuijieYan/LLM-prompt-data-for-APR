Potential error location: In the _set_url function, the error is likely occurring when checking for the presence of a scheme in the URL and raising a ValueError if it is missing.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug is likely occurring because the function is not properly handling URLs without a scheme (e.g., 'foo:bar').

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: One approach to fix the bug is to modify the _set_url function to handle URLs without a scheme more gracefully. This can be done by checking for the presence of a scheme in the URL and only raising a ValueError if it is missing when it should be present.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)

    s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)
    self._url = escape_ajax(s)
    
    if ':' not in urlparse(self._url).scheme:
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % self._url)
```
In the corrected code, the urlparse function is used to check for the presence of a scheme in the URL. If the scheme is missing, a ValueError is raised. This should address the bug and ensure that the test_url_no_scheme test case passes without any assertion errors.
