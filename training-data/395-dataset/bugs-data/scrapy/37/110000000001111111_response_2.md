The potential error in the provided function is that it is not properly validating the input URL. The function is supposed to check if the input URL is a string, and if it contains a scheme (e.g., http:// or https://). If the URL is not a string or does not contain a scheme, the function should raise a TypeError or ValueError.

The error occurs because the function is not properly checking for the presence of a scheme in the URL. As a result, when an invalid URL is passed to the function, it doesn't raise an error as expected.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be modified to properly validate the input URL by checking if it's a string and contains a scheme. Additionally, it should raise an error if the URL does not meet these criteria.

Here's the corrected code for the `_set_url` function:

```python
import six
from urllib.parse import urlparse

def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)

    parsed_url = urlparse(url)
    if not all([parsed_url.scheme, parsed_url.netloc]):
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme or netloc in request url: %s' % url)

    self._url = url
```

In the corrected code, we use the `urlparse` function from the `urllib.parse` module to parse the input URL and check if it contains a scheme and network location (netloc). If either of these is missing, a ValueError is raised. Otherwise, the URL is set in the object.

This fix ensures that the `_set_url` function properly validates the input URL and raises an error when it's invalid.
