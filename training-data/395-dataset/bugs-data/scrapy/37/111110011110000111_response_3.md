**Analysis:**
The error message indicates that a `ValueError` is not being raised by the `Request` function as expected.

**Bug Location:**
The bug is likely located in the `_set_url` function within the `Request` class.

**Reason for the Bug:**
The `ValueError` is not being raised when the URL does not have a scheme (e.g. 'http'). This is likely causing the test case to fail.

**Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:**
1. Add a condition to check for the presence of a scheme in the URL before setting it.
2. If the scheme is missing, raise a `ValueError`.

**Corrected Code:**
```python
import six

# class declaration containing the corrected function
class Request(object_ref):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def encoding(self):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # corrected function
    def _set_url(self, url):
        if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
            raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)
    
        s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)
        self._url = escape_ajax(s)
    
        if ':' not in self._url:
            raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % self._url)
```
By adding the condition to check for the presence of a scheme in the URL and raising a `ValueError` if it is missing, the bug should be fixed.
