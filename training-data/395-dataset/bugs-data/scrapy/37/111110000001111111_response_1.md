Potential Error Location:
The error is likely occurring in the `_set_url` method of the `Request` class, specifically in the line `s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)`. It seems that the `safe_url_string` and `escape_ajax` functions are not defined in the provided code and might be causing the issue.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `_set_url` method is not handling the invalid URL input correctly, leading to the silent acceptance of invalid URLs without raising any errors.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Add error handling and validation for the input URL to ensure it is valid before processing it further.
2. Implement proper error messages or logging to indicate when an invalid URL is encountered.

Corrected Code:
```python
import six

# Class declaration containing the corrected function
class Request(object_ref):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # Signature of a relative function in this class
    def encoding(self):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # Corrected version of the _set_url function
    def _set_url(self, url):
        if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
            raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)

        # Add proper error handling for invalid URLs
        if len(url) == 0 or 'http' not in url:  # Example validation, replace with appropriate condition
            raise ValueError('Invalid URL: %s' % url)

        # Implement proper URL processing
        s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)  # Define safe_url_string function as per requirements
        self._url = escape_ajax(s)  # Define escape_ajax function as per requirements

        if ':' not in self._url:
            raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % self._url)
```

Note: The code provided includes placeholder comments for the `safe_url_string` and `escape_ajax` functions, as they were not provided in the original code. These functions need to be defined as per the specific requirements of the application in order for the corrected code to function properly.
