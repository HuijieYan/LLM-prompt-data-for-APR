Potential error location: The potential error location is in the if statement checking if the url is a string with the isinstance() function.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug occurs because the isinstance() function is used incorrectly to check if the url is a string. This can lead to the TypeError being raised improperly.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, we should use the isinstance() function to check if the url is a string, but we should check for both str and unicode types separately.

Corrected code:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class Request(object_ref):
    # ... omitted code ...


    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def encoding(self):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass



    # this is the corrected function
    def _set_url(self, url):
        if not isinstance(url, str) and not isinstance(url, unicode):
            raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)
    
        s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding())
        self._url = escape_ajax(s)
    
        if ':' not in self._url:
            raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % self._url)
