The error message from the test function indicates that the ValueError is not being raised when the request_class is called with the '/foo:bar' url. This suggests that the URL validation inside the _set_url method is not working as expected.

The potential error location is within the if ':' not in self._url condition in the _set_url method. This condition is responsible for checking whether the passed URL contains a scheme or not.

The bug occurs because the URL validation inside the _set_url method is not comprehensive enough to catch all invalid URLs. As a result, some invalid URLs are not raising the ValueError as expected.

To fix the bug, the URL validation should be enhanced to cover more cases of invalid URLs. Additionally, a comprehensive set of test cases should be created to cover various types of invalid URLs.

Corrected code for the _set_url method:

```python
def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)

    s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)
    self._url = escape_ajax(s)

    if ':' not in self._url and not self._url.startswith("/"):
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % self._url)
```

In the corrected code, an additional check has been added to the condition to ensure that the URL doesn't start with "/". This will help in catching more cases of invalid URLs.
