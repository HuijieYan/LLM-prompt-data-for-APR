Potential error location: 

The error is likely occurring on the line `if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):`. This line checks if the `url` parameter is an instance of `six.string_types`, which is incorrect.

Reason behind the bug:

The `six.string_types` check is unnecessary and incorrect. It is used to check for string types in both Python 2 and 3, but it's not necessary in the context of this function.

Possible approaches:

Instead of using `six.string_types`, we can directly check if the `url` is an instance of `str` in Python 3.

Corrected code:

```python
def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, str):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)

    s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding())
    self._url = escape_ajax(s)

    if ':' not in self._url:
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % self._url)
```
