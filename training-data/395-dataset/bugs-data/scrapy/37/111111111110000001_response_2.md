The error is likely occurring in the `_set_url` function of the `Request` class. The error message from the test function indicates that a ValueError is not being raised when the input URL is missing a scheme.

The bug occurs because the `_set_url` function is not correctly handling the case where the input URL is missing a scheme. The function should raise a ValueError in this case, but it is not doing so.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_set_url` function to properly handle the case where the input URL is missing a scheme. We should check for the presence of a scheme in the URL and raise a ValueError if it is missing.

Here is the corrected code for the `_set_url` function:

```python
def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)
    
    # Check for missing scheme in the URL
    if ':' not in url:
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % url)
    
    s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)
    self._url = escape_ajax(s)
```

With this change, the `_set_url` function should correctly handle the case where the input URL is missing a scheme and raise a ValueError as expected.
