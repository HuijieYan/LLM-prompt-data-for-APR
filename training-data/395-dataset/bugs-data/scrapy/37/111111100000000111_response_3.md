Potential Error Location: The potential error is in the `_set_url` method where it checks if the URL has a valid scheme and raises a ValueError if it doesn't.

Reason for Bug: The bug occurs because the `Request` class does not properly handle the case where an invalid URL is passed to it. Instead of raising an error, it silently ignores the invalid URL.

Approach for Fixing the Bug: The `_set_url` method should be modified to handle the case of an invalid URL being passed to it. It should raise a ValueError or another appropriate exception to indicate the invalid URL.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)

    try:
        s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)
    except ValueError as e:
        raise ValueError('Invalid URL: %s' % e)

    self._url = escape_ajax(s)

    if ':' not in self._url:
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % self._url)
```

With these changes, the `_set_url` method now handles the case of an invalid URL being passed to it and raises a ValueError with appropriate error messages. This will provide better error handling and visibility into the issue when an invalid URL is passed to the `Request` class.
