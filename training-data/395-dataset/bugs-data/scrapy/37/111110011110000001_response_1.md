The test function is testing if the ValueError is raised when a URL without a scheme is passed to the request_class. The error message indicates that the ValueError is not being raised for the URL '/foo:bar'.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition `if ':' not in self._url`. This condition is checking if the URL contains a scheme, but it is not effectively identifying schemes.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the condition `if ':' not in self._url` is not a reliable way to check for the presence of a scheme in the URL. It is failing to correctly identify URLs with valid schemes, causing the ValueError not to be raised when it should.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to use a more robust method for identifying the presence of a scheme in the URL. This can be achieved by parsing the URL and extracting the scheme using the urllib library.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _set_url(self, url):
    from urllib.parse import urlparse

    parsed_url = urlparse(url)
    if parsed_url.scheme == '':
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % url)
    self._url = url
```

By using the `urlparse` function from the `urllib` library, we can correctly identify if the URL contains a scheme. If it does not, a ValueError is raised as expected.
