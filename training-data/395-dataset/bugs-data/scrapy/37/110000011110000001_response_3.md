The error message from the test function suggests that the `ValueError` is not being raised as expected when the `request_class` function is called with the argument '/foo:bar'.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition `if ':' not in self._url:` which is raising the `ValueError`.

The bug occurs because the condition `if ':' not in self._url:` is checking for the presence of a colon (':') in the URL to ensure that the URL contains a scheme (e.g., 'http:', 'https:', etc.). However, the test case '/foo:bar' does contain a colon, but it's not in the position expected for a scheme delimiter. This causes the condition to throw a `ValueError` when the colon is found at a position that doesn't match the expected scheme format.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the condition to check for the scheme format more accurately.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)

    s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)
    self._url = escape_ajax(s)

    if not urlparse(self._url).scheme:
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % self._url)
```

In the corrected code, we are using `urlparse` from the `urllib.parse` module to check if the URL has a scheme. If the scheme is missing, it will raise a `ValueError` as expected. This approach ensures that the scheme is checked accurately without errors.
