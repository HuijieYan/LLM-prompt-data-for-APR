Potential Error Location: 
The error is likely occurring in the `_set_url` method of the `Request` class. It seems that the method is not correctly handling the cases where the URL provided does not contain a scheme.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug is likely occurring because the `_set_url` method is not correctly checking for the presence of a scheme in the URL. As a result, when an invalid URL without a scheme is provided, the method is not raising a `ValueError` as expected.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_set_url` method to properly check for the presence of a scheme in the URL and raise a `ValueError` when it is missing.

Corrected Code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_37/scrapy/http/request/__init__.py

def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)
    
    s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)
    self._url = escape_ajax(s)
    
    if not urlparse(self._url).scheme:
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % self._url)
```

In the corrected code, we use the `urlparse` function to parse the URL and check for the presence of a scheme. If the scheme is missing, we raise a `ValueError` as required. This should fix the bug in the `_set_url` method.
