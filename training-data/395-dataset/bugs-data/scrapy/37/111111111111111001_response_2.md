Potential error location: The error seems to be occurring in the `_set_url` function within the `Request` class.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug is likely due to the missing handling of the case when the URL contains a colon (':') but does not have a scheme. This is causing the `ValueError` not to be raised for the test case `self.assertRaises(ValueError, self.request_class, '/foo:bar')`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add a check to ensure that the URL contains a scheme before raising a `ValueError`.
2. Update the logic to handle URLs without a scheme, possibly by considering them as relative paths or by handling them in a different way based on the specific requirements of the application.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)

    s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)
    self._url = escape_ajax(s)

    if ':' not in self._url:
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % self._url)
    elif ':' in self._url and not any(self._url.startswith(scheme) for scheme in ['http:', 'https:', 'ftp:', 'file:', 'data:']):
        raise ValueError('Invalid scheme in request url: %s' % self._url)
```

In the corrected code, an additional check has been added to ensure that the URL contains a valid scheme. If the URL does not contain a valid scheme, a `ValueError` is raised to handle this scenario.
