Potential Error Location: The error occurs in the `_set_url` method of the `Request` class. The method is not properly validating the URL before setting it, leading to the silent failure observed in the test case.

Reasons Behind the Bug: The bug occurs because the `_set_url` method does not perform proper validation on the input URL. This results in the method setting the URL without ensuring its correctness, leading to unexpected behavior further in the code.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Validate the URL input using a regular expression to ensure it conforms to a valid URL format.
2. Check for the presence of the scheme in the URL before setting it, as this could indicate an invalid URL.
3. Raise an appropriate exception with a descriptive error message when an invalid URL is provided.

Corrected Code:
```python
import six
from urllib.parse import urlparse

# class declaration containing the corrected function
class Request(object_ref):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # corrected _set_url function
    def _set_url(self, url):
        if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
            raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s' % type(url).__name__)

        parsed_url = urlparse(url)
        if not all([parsed_url.scheme, parsed_url.netloc]):
            raise ValueError('Invalid request url: %s' % url)

        self._url = url
```
