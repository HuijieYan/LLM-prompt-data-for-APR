Potential error location: The error occurs in the _set_url method of the Request class when it tries to create a Request with an invalid URL. The method first checks if the URL is a string, but it does not handle invalid URLs properly and does not provide any error message or traceback.

Reasons for the bug: The _set_url method does not properly check for invalid URLs or provide meaningful error messages, leading to silent failures when trying to create a Request with an invalid URL.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The _set_url method should validate the URL and raise an appropriate error if it is invalid. Additionally, it should provide detailed error messages or traceback information to help in debugging.

Corrected code:

```python
def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)

    try:
        s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding())
    except Exception as e:
        raise ValueError(f'Error processing URL: {url}, {e}')

    self._url = escape_ajax(s)

    if ':' not in self._url:
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % self._url)
```
In the corrected code, we have added a try-except block to capture any exceptions that occur during the processing of the URL. We also updated the call to self.encoding to include parentheses to properly invoke the method. Additionally, we have included more detailed error messages for better debugging.
