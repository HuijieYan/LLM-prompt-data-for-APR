Potential error location: The error is likely occurring within the _set_url method of the Request class.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: 
1. The URL validation is not correctly implemented, leading to the incorrect detection of scheme presence in the URL.
2. The error message is not being raised correctly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Validate and process the URL using a reliable library or method to ensure that the scheme is correctly detected.
2. Update the error message to provide more specific information about the issue.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _set_url(self, url):
    from urllib.parse import urlparse  # for processing the URL

    if not isinstance(url, str):  # using only the 'str' type for Python 3
        raise TypeError('Request url must be a string, got %s' % type(url).__name__)

    parsed_url = urlparse(url)
    if not all([parsed_url.scheme, parsed_url.netloc]):
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % url)

    self._url = url
```
In this corrected code, we use the `urlparse` method from the `urllib.parse` module to parse the URL and ensure that it has a scheme and a netloc. We also updated the error message to provide a clearer indication of the issue.
