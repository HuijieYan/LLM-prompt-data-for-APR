The error message from the test function indicates that the ValueError is not raised by the Request, which is an indication that the function _set_url is not correctly validating the URL.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the check for the presence of ":" in the URL:
```python
if ':' not in self._url:
    raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % self._url)
```
This check is supposed to ensure that the URL has a scheme (e.g., http, https) specified.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not correctly identifying the absence of a scheme in the URL due to the incorrect usage of the ":" character.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use a proper method to parse the URL and check for the presence of the scheme.
2. Use Python's urlparse library to parse the URL and validate the scheme.

The corrected code for the problematic function _set_url is as follows:
```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse

def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, str):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str, got %s' % type(url).__name__)

    parsed_url = urlparse(url)
    if not parsed_url.scheme:
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % url)

    s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)
    self._url = escape_ajax(s)
```
In this corrected code:
- We import the urlparse library from urllib.parse to parse the URL.
- We use urlparse to parse the URL and then check if the URL has a scheme. If it doesn't have a scheme, a ValueError is raised.
- We continue with the remaining functionality of the function as before.
