The error occurs in the test case where the converted colors of the images are being compared. The test is failing because the colors are not being converted correctly in the `convert_image` function.

The bug is located in the `convert_image` function where the image format and mode are checked. The issue is that the conditions for handling PNG with RGBA mode are not properly met.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `convert_image` function to correctly handle the conversion of PNG images with RGBA mode.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageFile
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected `convert_image` function, the test case should pass without any assertion errors.
