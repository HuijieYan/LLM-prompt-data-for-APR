Potential error location: The error could be in the line `background.paste(image, image)` where the `image` is being used as the second argument instead of just `(0, 0)`. This could be causing the function to fail.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug is likely caused by the incorrect usage of the `paste` method for the `background` image.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, we need to correct the usage of the `paste` method for the `background` image by providing the coordinates `(0, 0)` as the second argument instead of `image`.

Corrected code:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```
