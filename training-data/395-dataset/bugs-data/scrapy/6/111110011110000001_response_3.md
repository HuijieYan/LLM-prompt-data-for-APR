The error message indicates that the test case is failing because the list of colors in the converted image is not as expected. The test case is expecting a specific list of colors, but it's getting a different list.

The problem in the `convert_image` function lies in the method used to get the colors of the image. The function should be modified to accurately get the list of colors for the image.

The bug is occurring because the `getcolors` method does not accurately represent the colors in the image. It may be dependent on the version of the library being used and may not give consistent results. 

The bug can be fixed by replacing the `getcolors` method with a pixel count method that accurately counts the number of pixels of each color in the image.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')

    image = Image.open(buf)  # Reload the image from the buffer
    return image, buf
```

This corrected code fixes the bug by reloading the image from the buffer and then returning it. This ensures that the correct image data is used and the colors are accurately represented.
