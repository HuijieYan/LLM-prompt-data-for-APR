The test case is checking for the correct conversion of images and their colors. It is encountering an error when comparing the expected colors with the actual colors after the conversion.

The potential error in the problematic function is in the condition: `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':`. This condition is used to handle the case when the input image is in PNG format and has RGBA mode. However, the subsequent conversion and pasting logic in this block is incorrect, leading to the error in the test case.

The bug occurs because the condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':` is not handling the RGBA images correctly. Additionally, the logic to convert and paste the image is flawed, causing it to produce unexpected colors.

To fix the bug, we should modify the condition to be more explicit and handle the RGBA images properly. Additionally, the conversion and pasting logic should be corrected to preserve the alpha channel of the image.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageOps
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a new RGBA image with a white background
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        # Composite the original image onto the new background
        alpha_composite = Image.alpha_composite(background, image)
        # Convert the composited image to RGB
        image = alpha_composite.convert('RGB')

    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With these corrections, the `convert_image` function should handle PNG images with RGBA mode correctly and produce the expected results, resolving the error encountered in the test case.
