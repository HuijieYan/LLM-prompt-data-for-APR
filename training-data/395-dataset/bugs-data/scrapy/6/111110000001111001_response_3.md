The buggy function `convert_image` has a few issues that need to be addressed:

1. The first `if` condition checks for `image.format == 'PNG'`, but it should be checking for `'JPEG'` instead. This condition should be removed or modified to check whether the image format is `'JPEG'` instead.

2. Within the first `if` block, the `background.paste()` method is being passed `image` as a parameter, but it should be passed as the second parameter (the first parameter should be the image to be pasted). This line should be modified to `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)`. 

3. The `buf` variable is being used without being defined in the function. It needs to be created before being used to save the image.

4. There are some unnecessary lines of code such as `image = image.copy()` before thumbnail generation. It can be removed as it does not serve any purpose.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'JPEG':
        if image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
    else:
        # handle other image formats if needed
        pass
```

In this corrected code, the issues mentioned above have been addressed. The if condition now checks for `'JPEG'` format and the `background.paste()` method has been fixed. Additionally, the `buf` variable has been defined before being used to save the image.
