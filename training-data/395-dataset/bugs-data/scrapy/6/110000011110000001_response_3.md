The error message in the test case indicates that the function is not correctly converting the image from RGBA to RGB.

The potential error location within the function is in the first if-elif block where it checks for the image format and mode. In the first if statement, it pastes the original image onto a new RGBA background, but then it converts the resulting image to RGB unconditionally, regardless of the original mode.

The bug occurs because the function is not taking into account the original mode of the image when converting it. As a result, it forces the conversion to RGB even if the original image was already in RGB mode.

To fix this bug, the function needs to check the original mode of the image and handle each mode accordingly.

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    new_image = image.copy()
    
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)  # Paste the original image onto the new background
        new_image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        new_image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        new_image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    new_image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return new_image, buf
```

In this corrected code, I made the following changes:
1. Created a new copy of the original image to avoid modifying the input image directly.
2. Corrected the paste operation to correctly overlay the original image onto the new background.
3. Changed the variable name from "image" to "new_image" to make it clear that this variable holds the modified image.
4. Updated the return statement to return the new_image instead of the original image.
