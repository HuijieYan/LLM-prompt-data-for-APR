The issue arises from the incorrect conversion of images in the `convert_image` function. The function is supposed to handle the conversion of images to RGB format and generate thumbnails. 

The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle the case when the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'. In this case, it attempts to create a new image with a white background and paste the original image onto it. However, it incorrectly converts the image to RGB format after pasting.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be modified to correctly handle the case of PNG images with RGBA mode. Additionally, the other conversion operations should be checked to ensure they are working as expected.

Here's the corrected `convert_image` function:

```python
class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            # Create a new RGBA image with white background
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            return background, BytesIO()  # Return the new RGBA image
        else:
            # Convert the image to RGB and generate thumbnail
            image = image.convert('RGB')
            if size:
                image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
            buf = BytesIO()
            image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
            return image, buf
```

With this corrected function, the test cases should pass without any assertion errors.
