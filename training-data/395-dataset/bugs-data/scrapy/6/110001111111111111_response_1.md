The error occurs because the `convert_image` function is not correctly converting the images as per the expected output.

The potential error location is within the conditional statements that check the image format and mode.

The bug occurs because the conditional statements are not properly handling the cases where the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'. The conditional statement that converts RGBA images to RGB is not working as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional statements to handle the 'PNG' format and 'RGBA' mode correctly and ensure that the image is converted as per the expected output.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a new RGBA image with white background
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)  # Paste the original image on the new background
        image = background.convert('RGB')  # Convert the RGBA image to RGB
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')  # Convert other modes to RGB
    
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')  # Save the image in JPEG format
    return image, buf
```

The corrected code includes handling for the 'PNG' format and 'RGBA' mode, ensuring that the image is converted properly based on the given conditions.
