The error occurs at line 105 of the `test_convert_image` function in the file `test_pipeline_images.py`. The error is due to the fact that the expected list of colors is not matching the actual list of colors for the image after conversion.

The potential error location within the `convert_image` method is in the block handling the case where the image format is 'PNG' and the image mode is 'RGBA'. The code is attempting to change the image format to 'RGB' and convert it to a new image. However, there are issues in this block of code that could cause the error.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug could be incorrect handling of transparency and color channels when converting the image from RGBA to RGB.

To fix the bug, the code for handling the 'PNG' and 'RGBA' case needs to be modified to correctly handle transparency and color channels during conversion.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` method:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageFile
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a new white background to handle transparency
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        
        # Composite the original image onto the white background
        composed = Image.alpha_composite(background, image)
        
        # Convert the composite image to RGB
        converted_image = composed.convert('RGB')
    else:
        # For images that are not RGBA, simply convert to RGB
        converted_image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        # Create a copy of the converted image to apply thumbnail without altering original
        thumb_image = converted_image.copy()
        thumb_image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    else:
        thumb_image = converted_image

    buf = BytesIO()
    thumb_image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return thumb_image, buf
```

This corrected code addresses the issues related to transparency and color channels when converting a PNG image from RGBA to RGB.
