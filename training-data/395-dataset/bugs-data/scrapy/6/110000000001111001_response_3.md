Potential Error Location:
The bug might be in the section where the function checks for the image format and mode and tries to convert the image accordingly.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because the code is checking for specific image formats and modes but is not handling all possible cases. The function does not account for the cases where the image format is not PNG or the mode is not RGBA. Additionally, the code to convert the image to RGB format is not correctly handling the case where the image is already in RGB format.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check for all possible image formats and modes, not just 'PNG' and 'RGBA'.
2. Provide a default behavior for cases where the format or mode does not match the specified conditions.
3. Ensure that the conversion to RGB format only occurs if the image is not already in RGB format.

Corrected Code:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format != 'PNG' or image.mode != 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGBA')  # Convert to RGBA if not already in that mode
    else:
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')  # Convert to RGB
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```
