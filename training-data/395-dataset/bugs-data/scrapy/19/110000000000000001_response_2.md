Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is in the `urlparse_cached` function. It seems that the function is not imported or defined within the original code snippet.

Reason for the Bug:
The function `urlparse_cached` is being called but it is not defined or imported within the provided code snippet. This is causing a NameError as the interpreter cannot find the definition of `urlparse_cached`.

Approach to Fix the Bug:
1. Import the `urlparse_cached` function from the appropriate module if it is an external function.
2. If `urlparse_cached` is a custom function, define it within the current module.

Corrected Code:
Below is the corrected code with the assumption that `urlparse_cached` is an external function from the `urllib.parse` module.

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse

# corrected function
def get_origin_req_host(self):
    return urlparse(self.request).hostname
```
