The buggy code is trying to return the hostname from a urlparse_cached object, but there are no imports or information about what urlparse_cached is, so it's hard to determine exactly what the function is trying to do.

However, based on the provided information, it seems like the bug might be related to the way the function `get_origin_req_host` is trying to extract the hostname from the request. The error message indicates that the 'WrappedRequest' object has no attribute 'type', which suggests that the function is trying to access an attribute that does not exist.

To fix the bug, the code should be modified to extract the hostname from the request object in a different way. Since there are no details about the definition of the 'WrappedRequest' object and the 'urlparse_cached' function, it's difficult to suggest a specific correction.

Here's a potential fix based on the information provided:
```python
def get_origin_req_host(self):
    return self.request.url.split('/')[2]
```
This code assumes that the 'WrappedRequest' object has a 'url' attribute that contains the full URL, and it uses string manipulation to extract the hostname. This is just a guess, and the actual correction might be different depending on the actual definition of the 'WrappedRequest' object and the 'urlparse_cached' function.
