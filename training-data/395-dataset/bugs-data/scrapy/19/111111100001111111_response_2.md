The error occurs in the `get_origin_req_host` method of the `WrappedRequest` class. This method is trying to access the `hostname` attribute of the result of the `urlparse_cached` function applied to `self.request`, but it seems that `urlparse_cached` does not return a suitable object.

One possible reason for this bug is that the `urlparse_cached` function may not be returning an object that has a `hostname` attribute, or it may not be returning anything at all due to some error.

To fix this bug, we need to use the correct method or function to parse the URL and extract the hostname.

Here's the corrected code using the `urlparse` function from the `urllib.parse` module, which is a better choice for parsing URLs in Python 3:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse

class WrappedRequest(object):
    """
    Wraps a scrapy Request class with methods defined by urllib2.Request class to interact with CookieJar class
    
    see http://docs.python.org/library/urllib2.html#urllib2.Request
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def get_origin_req_host(self):
        return urlparse(self.request.url).hostname
```
