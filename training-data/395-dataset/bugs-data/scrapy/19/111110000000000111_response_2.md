The error is occurring in the `add_cookie_header` method of the `CookiesMiddleware`, which is a built-in Scrapy middleware responsible for managing cookies. The error message indicates that the `WrappedRequest` object does not have an attribute called `type`.

Upon looking at the `get_origin_req_host` method of the `WrappedRequest` class, it is clear that the `urlparse_cached` function is being used without being properly imported, and the output of the function is being used to extract the hostname. This seems to be the root cause of the bug.

To fix the bug, we need to import the `urlparse_cached` function correctly and ensure that it returns a valid value for extracting the hostname.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_origin_req_host` method:

```python
from scrapy.utils.url import urlparse_cached

class WrappedRequest(object):
    """
    Wraps a scrapy Request class with methods defined by urllib2.Request class to interact with CookieJar class
    
    see http://docs.python.org/library/urllib2.html#urllib2.Request
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def get_origin_req_host(self):
        return urlparse_cached(self.request).hostname if hasattr(self.request, 'url') else None
```

In the corrected code, the `urlparse_cached` function is imported from `scrapy.utils.url` and used to extract the hostname from the request's URL. The `hasattr` check ensures that the request has a valid URL before extracting the hostname.
