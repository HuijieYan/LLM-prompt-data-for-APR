The error seems to be occurring because the 'origin_req_host' attribute is not being properly set in the 'get_origin_req_host' method inside the 'WrappedRequest' class. This causes the AttributeError when the 'test_get_origin_req_host' method tries to access it.

The issue is with the 'get_origin_req_host' method which is trying to access the hostname of the request URL using 'urlparse_cached' function, but it's not setting the 'origin_req_host' attribute properly.

To fix this issue, the 'origin_req_host' attribute should be set when the 'WrappedRequest' object is created. This can be done by adding a property/attribute to the 'WrappedRequest' class which gets the hostname from the request URL.

Here's the corrected code for the 'get_origin_req_host' method and the 'WrappedRequest' class:

```python
from scrapy.http import Request
from scrapy.http.cookies import WrappedRequest

class WrappedRequest(WrappedRequest):
    @property
    def origin_req_host(self):
        return self.url.split('//')[-1].split('/')[0]

def get_origin_req_host(self):
    return urlparse_cached(self.request).hostname
```

With these changes, the 'origin_req_host' attribute of the 'WrappedRequest' class will be set properly, and the 'get_origin_req_host' method will be able to return the correct hostname from the request URL.
