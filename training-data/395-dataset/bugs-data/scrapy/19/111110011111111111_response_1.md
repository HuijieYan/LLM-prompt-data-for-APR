The potential error in the buggy function is that the 'request' property is not defined within the class 'WrappedRequest', which leads to an AttributeError when trying to access it.

The reason behind this bug is that the 'get_origin_req_host' function is trying to access the 'request' property which is not defined within the 'WrappedRequest' class. This is causing an AttributeError when trying to access the 'hostname' property of the 'request'.

To fix this bug, the 'request' property needs to be defined within the 'WrappedRequest' class, and then the 'get_origin_req_host' function can access the 'hostname' property of the 'request' correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class WrappedRequest(object):
    """
    Wraps a scrapy Request class with methods defined by urllib2.Request class to
    interact with CookieJar class

    see http://docs.python.org/library/urllib2.html#urllib2.Request
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def __init__(self, request):
        self.request = request

    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def get_origin_req_host(self):
        return urlparse_cached(self.request).hostname
```
