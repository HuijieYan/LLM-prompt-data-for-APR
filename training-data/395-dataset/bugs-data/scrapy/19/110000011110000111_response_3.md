The error message indicates that the 'WrappedRequest' object doesn't have the attribute 'origin_req_host'. This means that the 'origin_req_host' attribute is missing in the 'WrappedRequest' class. The 'get_origin_req_host' method also seems to be trying to access the 'hostname' attribute using the 'urlparse_cached' function, which is not defined within the provided code.

Upon analyzing the provided function and the error message, it seems that the bug occurs due to the missing 'origin_req_host' attribute and the undefined 'urlparse_cached' function.

To fix this bug, the code should be updated to include the necessary attribute and function. It could also be possible that the method is incorrectly implemented to get the origin request host.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse

class WrappedRequest:
    def __init__(self, request):
        self.request = request
        self.origin_req_host = urlparse(request).hostname
    
    def get_origin_req_host(self):
        return self.origin_req_host
```

In this corrected code, the 'urlparse_cached' function has been replaced with the 'urlparse' function from the 'urllib.parse' module. Additionally, the missing 'origin_req_host' attribute is now properly initialized within the 'WrappedRequest' class, and the 'get_origin_req_host' method returns the 'origin_req_host' attribute. Note that it is assumed that the 'WrappedRequest' class exists based on the error message provided. If the class needs to be defined as well, it's not shown in the provided code.
