The error is occurring in the `get_origin_req_host` function of the `WrappedRequest` class. The error message indicates that the `WrappedRequest` object does not have an attribute called `type`, which is being used in the `get_origin_req_host` function.

The issue is happening because the `get_origin_req_host` function is attempting to access the `type` attribute of the `WrappedRequest` object, which is not defined.

To fix the bug, the `get_origin_req_host` function can be modified to access the `type` attribute from the `request` attribute of the `WrappedRequest` object.

Below is the corrected code for the `get_origin_req_host` function:

```python
def get_origin_req_host(self):
    return urlparse_cached(self.request.url).hostname
```
