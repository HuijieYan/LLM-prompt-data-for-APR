Potential error location:
The error is occurring in the `get_origin_req_host` method of the `WrappedRequest` class. The method is supposed to return the value of the `hostname` attribute from the parsed URL of the request. However, it seems that the `origin_req_host` attribute is not being set correctly or is missing in the `WrappedRequest` class, which leads to the AttributeError when trying to access it.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug is occurring because the `origin_req_host` attribute is not being set correctly or is missing in the `WrappedRequest` class. This can be due to a missing attribute assignment in the class or an issue with how the `self.request` attribute is being used to retrieve the hostname.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the `origin_req_host` attribute is correctly set when creating the `WrappedRequest` object, possibly in the constructor of the class.
2. Check the `self.request` attribute and how it is being used to parse the URL. It's possible that the `urlparse_cached` function is not correctly extracting the hostname from the request.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def get_origin_req_host(self):
    return urlparse_cached(self.url).hostname
```

In this corrected code, the `urlparse_cached` function is used to parse the `self.url` attribute, which is assumed to contain the full URL of the request. Then, the `hostname` attribute of the parsed URL is returned. This assumes that the `urlparse_cached` function is correctly parsing the URL and extracting the hostname. If the `urlparse_cached` function is not available, you can use the `urllib.parse.urlparse` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse

def get_origin_req_host(self):
    return urlparse(self.request.url).hostname
```
