The potential error location within the problematic function is the `get_origin_req_host` method, specifically the line `return urlparse_cached(self.request).hostname`. The error message indicates that 'WrappedRequest' object has no attribute 'type', which suggests that the method `urlparse_cached` is not handling the request properly.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `urlparse_cached` method is not correctly extracting the hostname from the request, leading to an AttributeError when attempting to access the 'type' attribute that does not exist in the 'WrappedRequest' object.

To fix the bug, the `urlparse_cached` method should be replaced with a method or function that properly parses the request and extracts the hostname.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_origin_req_host` method:

```python
def get_origin_req_host(self):
    return self.request.url.split('/')[2]  # Extracting the hostname from the request URL
```
