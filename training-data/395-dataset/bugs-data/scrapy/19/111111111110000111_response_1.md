Potential Error Location:
The error seems to be occurring in the get_origin_req_host function within the WrappedRequest class. This is indicated by the AttributeError message stating that the 'WrappedRequest' object has no attribute 'origin_req_host'.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The error 'WrappedRequest' object has no attribute 'origin_req_host' occurs because the origin_req_host attribute is being used in the test function, but it is not defined anywhere in the WrappedRequest class.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the origin_req_host attribute needs to be defined within the WrappedRequest class.

Corrected Code:
```python
class WrappedRequest(object):
    """
    Wraps a scrapy Request class with methods defined by urllib2.Request class to interact with CookieJar class
    
    see http://docs.python.org/library/urllib2.html#urllib2.Request
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    def get_origin_req_host(self):
        return urlparse_cached(self.request).hostname
    
    @property
    def origin_req_host(self):
        return urlparse_cached(self.request).hostname
```
In the corrected code, the origin_req_host attribute is defined as a property that returns the hostname obtained from the `urlparse_cached(self.request)`. This should resolve the AttributeError issue.
