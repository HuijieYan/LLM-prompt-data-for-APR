The error message indicates that the 'WrappedRequest' object does not have an attribute 'type', which is causing the AttributeError. This error occurs when attempting to download the second request with secure cookies.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the 'get_origin_req_host' method, specifically the 'urlparse_cached(self.request).hostname' statement.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the 'WrappedRequest' object does not have an attribute 'type', and the code is attempting to access that attribute.

To fix the bug, we can modify the 'get_origin_req_host' method to directly access the hostname from the request. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_origin_req_host(self):
    return self.request.hostname
```
