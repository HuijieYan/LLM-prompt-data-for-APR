The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError because 'WrappedRequest' object has no attribute 'type'. This means that the method `get_origin_req_host` is not returning the correct attribute.

The potential error location in the code is the `return urlparse_cached(self.request).hostname` line.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the method get_origin_req_host is not correctly extracting the hostname attribute from the request object.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the method to correctly extract the hostname attribute from the request object.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_origin_req_host(self):
    return urlparse_cached(self.request.url).hostname
```

By using `self.request.url` instead of just `self.request`, we can access the URL attribute of the request, and then use the urlparse_cached function to get the hostname. This should resolve the AttributeError and fix the bug.
