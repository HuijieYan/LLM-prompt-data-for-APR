The test case `test_get_origin_req_host` is checking the `get_origin_req_host` method of the `WrappedRequest` class. The error message indicates that the `WrappedRequest` object does not have an attribute called `origin_req_host`, leading to an `AttributeError`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `get_origin_req_host` method, specifically the `self.request` attribute. It seems that `self.request` is being used without being properly defined or initialized in the `WrappedRequest` class.

The bug occurred because the `self.request` attribute was not defined or initialized in the `WrappedRequest` class, leading to the `AttributeError` when trying to access its hostname.

To fix this bug, the `self.request` attribute needs to be properly defined and initialized in the `WrappedRequest` class. Additionally, the `origin_req_host` attribute should also be initialized and returned by the `get_origin_req_host` method.

The corrected code for the `get_origin_req_host` method in the `WrappedRequest` class is as follows:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse

class WrappedRequest(object):
    """
    Wraps a scrapy Request class with methods defined by urllib2.Request class to interact with CookieJar class
    see http://docs.python.org/library/urllib2.html#urllib2.Request
    """

    def __init__(self, request):
        self.request = request
        self.origin_req_host = urlparse(request.url).hostname

    def get_origin_req_host(self):
        return self.origin_req_host
```

In this corrected code, the `__init__` method is used to initialize the `self.request` attribute, and the `origin_req_host` attribute is calculated using the `urlparse` function and stored for later use. The `get_origin_req_host` method then returns the `origin_req_host` attribute instead of trying to access `self.request`.
