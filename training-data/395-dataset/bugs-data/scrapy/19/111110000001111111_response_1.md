The bug occurs in the `get_origin_req_host` function of the `WrappedRequest` class, where it attempts to access a `type` attribute from `self.request`, which causes an AttributeError.

The error occurs because the `get_origin_req_host` function is trying to access the `type` attribute of the `self.request` object, but the `self.request` object does not have a `type` attribute. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `get_origin_req_host` function to use the `self.request` object and its methods to achieve the desired functionality.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_origin_req_host` function:

```python
def get_origin_req_host(self):
    return urlparse_cached(self.request.url).hostname
```

In the corrected function, we are using the `url` attribute of the `self.request` object and passing it to the `urlparse_cached` function to retrieve the hostname. This should resolve the AttributeError and provide the expected behavior.
