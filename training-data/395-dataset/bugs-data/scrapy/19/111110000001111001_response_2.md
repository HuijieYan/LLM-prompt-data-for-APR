The buggy function `get_origin_req_host` is attempting to access the `request` attribute of the `WrappedRequest` class and then use the `urlparse_cached` function, but it is missing the import statement for `urlparse_cached` and the `Request` class.

The potential error location is the missing import statement for the `urlparse_cached` function.

The bug occurred because the `urlparse_cached` function was not imported and the `Request` class was not properly defined.

To fix the bug, we need to import the `urlparse_cached` function and the `Request` class. We also need to handle the 'self' parameter properly and access the `url` attribute of the `request` object to get the hostname.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_origin_req_host` function:

```python
# import statements
from scrapy.utils.url import urlparse_cached
from scrapy.http.request import Request

# class declaration containing the corrected function
class WrappedRequest(object):
    """
    Wraps a scrapy Request class with methods defined by urllib2.Request class to interact with CookieJar class
    
    see http://docs.python.org/library/urllib2.html#urllib2.Request
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # the corrected function
    def get_origin_req_host(self):
        return urlparse_cached(self.request.url).hostname
```
