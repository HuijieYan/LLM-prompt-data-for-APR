Potential Error:
The function `urlparse_cached` is not defined within the scope of the provided code.

Reason for the Bug:
The function `urlparse_cached` is being called but it has not been defined within the scope of the provided code. This is causing the error.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Import the `urlparse_cached` function from the appropriate module, if available.
2. Use the Python built-in `urllib.parse` module to parse the URL and extract the hostname.

Corrected code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_19/scrapy/http/cookies.py

# corrected function
from urllib.parse import urlparse

def get_origin_req_host(self):
    return urlparse(self.request.url).hostname
```
