The error message and the provided test function indicate that the 'WrappedRequest' object does not have an attribute 'origin_req_host', which causes the 'get_origin_req_host' function to fail.

The potential error location within the 'get_origin_req_host' function is the 'origin_req_host' attribute. This attribute is expected to be returned by the 'get_origin_req_host' function, but it's not present in the original implementation.

The bug occurred because the 'origin_req_host' attribute was not implemented in the 'WrappedRequest' class even though it was being referenced in the test function.

To fix the bug, the 'origin_req_host' attribute needs to be implemented in the 'WrappedRequest' class, and the 'get_origin_req_host' function should return this attribute.

Here's the corrected code for the 'get_origin_req_host' function:

```python
def get_origin_req_host(self):
    return urlparse_cached(self.request).hostname
```

And here's the corrected 'WrappedRequest' class with the implementation of the 'origin_req_host' attribute:

```python
class WrappedRequest(object):
    """
    Wraps a scrapy Request class with methods defined by urllib2.Request class to interact with CookieJar class
    see http://docs.python.org/library/urllib2.html#urllib2.Request
    """
    def __init__(self, request):
        self.request = request
        self.origin_req_host = urlparse_cached(self.request).hostname
```

By implementing the 'origin_req_host' attribute in the class and returning it in the 'get_origin_req_host' function, the bug can be resolved.
