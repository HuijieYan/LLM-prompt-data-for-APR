Potential Error Location: The error seems to be occurring due to the missing attribute 'origin_req_host' in the WrappedRequest class.

Reason for the Bug: The get_origin_req_host function is trying to access the 'origin_req_host' attribute from the WrappedRequest class, which is not defined in the class.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug: The 'origin_req_host' attribute needs to be defined in the WrappedRequest class so that it can be accessed by the get_origin_req_host function.

Corrected Code:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class WrappedRequest(object):
    """
    Wraps a scrapy Request class with methods defined by urllib2.Request class to interact with CookieJar class
    
    see http://docs.python.org/library/urllib2.html#urllib2.Request
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def __init__(self, request):
        self.request = request
        self.origin_req_host = urlparse_cached(self.request).hostname

    def get_origin_req_host(self):
        return self.origin_req_host
```

In this corrected code, the 'origin_req_host' attribute is initialized in the constructor (__init__) of the WrappedRequest class, and the get_origin_req_host function simply returns this attribute. This ensures that the 'origin_req_host' attribute is available for access within the class, resolving the AttributeError observed in the test function.
