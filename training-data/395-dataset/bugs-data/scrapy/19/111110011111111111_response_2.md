The error message indicates that the 'WrappedRequest' object has no attribute 'origin_req_host', which is being checked in the test case. The 'origin_req_host' attribute is not defined in the code provided.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the 'get_origin_req_host' method.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is the missing implementation of the 'origin_req_host' attribute, which is expected to exist in the 'WrappedRequest' class.

To fix the bug, the 'origin_req_host' attribute should be implemented in the 'WrappedRequest' class and assigned the same value as the hostname extracted from the request URL.

Here's the corrected code for the 'get_origin_req_host' method:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class WrappedRequest(object):
    """
    Wraps a scrapy Request class with methods defined by urllib2.Request class to interact with CookieJar class
    
    see http://docs.python.org/library/urllib2.html#urllib2.Request
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def get_origin_req_host(self):
        return urlparse_cached(self.request).hostname

    @property
    def origin_req_host(self):
        return urlparse_cached(self.request).hostname
```

With this correction, the 'origin_req_host' attribute will now be accessible, and the test should pass without errors.
