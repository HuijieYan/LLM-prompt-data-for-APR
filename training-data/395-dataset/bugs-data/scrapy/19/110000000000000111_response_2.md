Potential error location: The "get_origin_req_host" function is using the "urlparse_cached" function, which is not a standard library function and may not exist.

Reasons behind the bug: The error message indicates that the 'WrappedRequest' object has no attribute 'type'. This suggests that the "urlparse_cached" function is not returning the expected object, leading to the AttributeError when trying to access the 'type' attribute.

Approaches for fixing the bug: We need to use the standard library function "urlparse" to correctly parse the URL and retrieve the hostname. Additionally, we need to ensure that the correct request object is being used to extract the hostname.

# Corrected code:
```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse

def get_origin_req_host(self):
    return urlparse(self.request.url).hostname
```
