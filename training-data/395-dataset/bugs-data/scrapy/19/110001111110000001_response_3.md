The test case is trying to check the value of `origin_req_host` attribute after calling the `get_origin_req_host` method. However, the AttributeError indicates that there is no `origin_req_host` attribute in the `WrappedRequest` object.

The `get_origin_req_host` method is trying to access the `hostname` attribute of the result of `urlparse_cached(self.request)`. However, the `urlparse_cached` function is not provided in the given code, so it's possible that it's either a custom function or a typo of the `urlparse` function provided by Python's built-in `urllib.parse` module.

To fix the bug, it is assumed that `urlparse_cached` is meant to be `urlparse` from the `urllib.parse` module. In this case, the corrected code for the `get_origin_req_host` method would be as follows:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_19/scrapy/http/cookies.py

# corrected function
def get_origin_req_host(self):
    return urlparse(self.request).hostname
```

With this corrected code, the `get_origin_req_host` method will parse the `self.request` URL using `urlparse` and return the hostname.
