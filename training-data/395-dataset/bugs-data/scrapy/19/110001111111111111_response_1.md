The error message indicates that the 'WrappedRequest' object does not have an attribute 'origin_req_host', which is expected in the test function.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the 'get_origin_req_host' method. The method is trying to access the hostname through the 'urlparse_cached' function, but there is no attribute 'hostname' in the returned result.

The bug occurred because 'urlparse_cached(self.request)' does not return the expected result. Instead of the returned value being a URL string, it is of type 'WrappedRequest' which does not have the necessary attributes. 

To fix the bug, we need to retrieve the URL from 'self.request' and then parse it to obtain the hostname.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse

def get_origin_req_host(self):
    url = self.request.url
    hostname = urlparse(url).hostname
    return hostname
```
