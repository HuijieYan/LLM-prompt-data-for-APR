This bug is related to the "get_origin_req_host" method in the "cookies.py" file of the Scrapy package. The error indicates that the 'WrappedRequest' object has no attribute 'origin_req_host', which is causing the AttributeError. This means that the "origin_req_host" attribute is missing, and it's likely related to the implementation of the "get_origin_req_host" method.

The "get_origin_req_host" method is attempting to extract the hostname from the request object, but it seems that the 'origin_req_host' attribute is not being set in the same class where the 'get_origin_req_host' method is defined.

To fix this bug, you can follow these possible approaches:
1. Check the "WrappedRequest" class to see if the 'origin_req_host' attribute is defined and set correctly when the request object is created.
2. If the 'origin_req_host' attribute is missing, modify the "get_origin_req_host" method to extract the hostname directly from the request object without relying on the 'origin_req_host' attribute.

Here's the corrected code for the "get_origin_req_host" method:

```python
def get_origin_req_host(self):
    return urlparse_cached(self.request).hostname or ''
```

In this corrected version, the "get_origin_req_host" method will use the urlparse_cached function to extract the hostname from the request. If the hostname is not found, it will return an empty string. This approach avoids relying on the 'origin_req_host' attribute, which may be missing or not set correctly.
