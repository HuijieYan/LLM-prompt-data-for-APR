Potential error location:
The error is likely occurring in the line `return urlparse_cached(self.request).hostname`. This code is trying to call the `urlparse_cached` function with `self.request` as an argument, but it's not clear what `urlparse_cached` is or where it's defined.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `urlparse_cached` function is not defined in the provided code, so trying to call it will result in an error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define the `urlparse_cached` function within the same file or import it from another module if it's part of a library.
2. Use the built-in `urllib.parse.urlparse` function instead of `urlparse_cached` if it serves a similar purpose.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_19/scrapy/http/cookies.py
from urllib.parse import urlparse

def get_origin_req_host(self):
    return urlparse(self.request).hostname
```
