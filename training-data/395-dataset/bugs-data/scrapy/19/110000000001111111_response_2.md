The error is likely occurring because the `get_origin_req_host` method is attempting to access the `hostname` attribute from the result of `urlparse_cached(self.request)`, which is not part of the functionality of the `WrappedRequest` object.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `get_origin_req_host` method to handle the different types of requests appropriately.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_origin_req_host` method:

```python
def get_origin_req_host(self):
    if isinstance(self.request, Request):
        return urlparse_cached(self.request).hostname
    elif isinstance(self.request, WrappedRequest):
        return urlparse_cached(self.request.request).hostname
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the `self.request` is an instance of `Request` or `WrappedRequest` and handle each case accordingly. If it's a `WrappedRequest`, we access the `request` attribute of `self.request` and then use `urlparse_cached` to extract the hostname. This change ensures that the method works correctly for both types of requests, fixing the bug.
