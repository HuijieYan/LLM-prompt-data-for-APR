The error message indicates that the 'WrappedRequest' object does not have an attribute 'origin_req_host' as expected in the test function. This suggests that the 'get_origin_req_host' method might not be setting the 'origin_req_host' attribute correctly.

The potential error location within the 'get_origin_req_host' method is in the return statement:
```python
return urlparse_cached(self.request).hostname
```
Here, 'urlparse_cached' is used without being imported, and 'self.request' is not defined within the 'get_origin_req_host' method.

The bug occurred because the 'urlparse_cached' function is not imported and 'self.request' is not defined, which causes the method to fail to return the hostname, leading to the 'origin_req_host' attribute not being set properly.

To fix the bug, the 'urlparse_cached' function needs to be imported and the 'self.request' attribute or its equivalent should be used to fetch the hostname correctly.

Here's the corrected 'get_origin_req_host' method with the assumption that 'urlparse_cached' is imported correctly:
```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class WrappedRequest(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def get_origin_req_host(self):
        return urlparse(self.request.url).hostname
```
In this corrected code, we import 'urlparse' and then use it to parse the 'self.request.url' to get the hostname. This should fix the bug and set the 'origin_req_host' attribute as expected.
