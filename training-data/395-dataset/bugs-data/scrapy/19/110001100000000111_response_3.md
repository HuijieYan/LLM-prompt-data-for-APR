Potential error location:
The error occurs in the `add_cookie_header` method of the `CookiesMiddleware` class, specifically at this line:
`if cookie.secure and request.type != "https":`

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The error message "AttributeError: 'WrappedRequest' object has no attribute 'type'" indicates that the `type` attribute is missing from the request object. This could be due to a change in the request object's structure or a typo in the attribute name.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
One possible approach to fixing the bug is to replace `request.type` with `request.url` and check if the URL scheme is "https". Another approach could be to use the `urlparse` function to extract the scheme from the request URL.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse

def get_origin_req_host(self):
    return urlparse(self.request.url).hostname
```
