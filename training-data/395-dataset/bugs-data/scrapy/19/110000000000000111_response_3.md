The potential cause of the bug is the 'get_origin_req_host' method not being implemented correctly. The 'urlparse_cached' method is likely not functioning as intended, as it returns a URL structure object and not the 'hostname' attribute as expected.

The error message 'AttributeError: 'WrappedRequest' object has no attribute 'type'' seems to be related to the incorrect implementation of the 'get_origin_req_host' method, which leads to the 'request' object not having the expected 'type' attribute.

To fix the bug, the 'get_origin_req_host' method should be modified. It should parse the request URL and extract the hostname directly from the 'request' object, instead of relying on the 'urlparse_cached' function.

Here's the corrected code for the 'get_origin_req_host' method:

```python
def get_origin_req_host(self):
    return self.request.headers.get('Host').decode()
```
