The bug in the `_serialize_value` function is that it checks for the type of the `value` without considering that the previous if conditions might already cover those cases. This means that the logic might not flow as intended, and certain types of `value` might be processed more than once.

To fix this bug:
1. Remove the individual type checks for `BaseItem`, `dict`, and list-like values, as these cases are covered in the previous if conditions.
2. Use an `else` statement at the end to handle the default case if none of the previous conditions are met.

Here's the corrected code for the `_serialize_value` function:

```python
def _serialize_value(self, value):
    if isinstance(value, BaseItem):
        return self.export_item(value)
    elif self.binary:
        return to_bytes(value, encoding=self.encoding)
    else:
        return to_unicode(value, encoding=self.encoding)
```

With this correction, the function will first check if the `value` is a `BaseItem` and export it if it is. If not, it will handle other cases by converting `value` to bytes if `self.binary` is true, and to unicode with the specified encoding otherwise.
