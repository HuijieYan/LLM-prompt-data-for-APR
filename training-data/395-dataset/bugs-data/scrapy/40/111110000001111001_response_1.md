The buggy function `_serialize_value` is designed to handle different types of input values and serialize them accordingly. However, there are a few issues in the function that need to be addressed.

In all the provided test cases, the function is not properly handling the input value types and returning the expected output. The potential error is that the function is not handling all the possible input types correctly, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly handle different input types and return the expected output. We can use conditional statements to check the data type of the input value and serialize it accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_serialize_value` function:

```python
def _serialize_value(self, value):
    if isinstance(value, BaseItem):
        return self.export_item(value)
    elif isinstance(value, dict):
        return {k: self._serialize_value(v) for k, v in value.items()}
    elif isinstance(value, (list, tuple)):
        return [self._serialize_value(v) for v in value]
    elif self.binary:
        return to_bytes(value, encoding=self.encoding)
    else:
        return to_unicode(value, encoding=self.encoding)
```

In this corrected code, we have added an additional check for the input type being a list or tuple, and we are recursively serializing the elements of the list or tuple. Additionally, we are properly handling the serialization of dictionary values by iterating through the items and serializing each value.

With these modifications, the function should now be able to properly handle different input types and return the expected output for the given test cases.
