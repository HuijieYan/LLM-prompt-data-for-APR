The bug is likely occurring in the `_serialize_value` function of the `PythonItemExporter` class. The function is trying to handle different types of input values and serialize them based on their type. However, the bug seems to be related to the handling of the boolean values.

Based on the test cases provided, the function should be able to handle boolean values correctly. However, the current implementation does not seem to be handling boolean values properly.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic for handling different types of input values to properly handle boolean values. Here's the corrected code for the `_serialize_value` function:

```python
def _serialize_value(self, value):
    if isinstance(value, BaseItem):
        return self.export_item(value)
    elif isinstance(value, dict):
        return dict(self._serialize_dict(value))
    elif is_listlike(value):
        return [self._serialize_value(v) for v in value]
    elif self.binary:
        return to_bytes(value, encoding=self.encoding)
    elif isinstance(value, bool):
        return str(value).lower()  # Serialize boolean values to lowercase strings
    else:
        return to_unicode(value, encoding=self.encoding)
```

In the corrected code, we added an `elif` condition to specifically handle boolean values. We convert the boolean value to lowercase string representation.

This should address the bug and ensure that boolean values are properly handled during serialization.
