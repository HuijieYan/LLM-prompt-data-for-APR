Potential error location: The if-elif conditions within the _serialize_value function seem to be the source of the bug. The issue may be that the conditional checks are not mutually exclusive, meaning that a single value could satisfy multiple conditions, leading to unexpected behavior.

Reason for the bug: The if-elif conditions are not mutually exclusive, so a value could satisfy multiple conditions and return an unexpected result. Additionally, the order of conditions might not be optimal, leading to potential issues in the function logic.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Change the if-elif conditions to if conditions, checking for each condition independently instead of in a mutually exclusive manner.
2. Rearrange the if conditions to follow a logical order, ensuring that more specific conditions are checked before more general ones.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _serialize_value(self, value):
    if isinstance(value, BaseItem):
        return self.export_item(value)
    elif isinstance(value, dict):
        return dict(self._serialize_dict(value))
    elif is_listlike(value):
        return [self._serialize_value(v) for v in value]
    elif self.binary:
        return to_bytes(value, encoding=self.encoding)
    else:
        return to_unicode(value, encoding=self.encoding)
```
