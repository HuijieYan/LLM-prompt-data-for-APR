The bug is occurring in the `_serialize_value` function within the `PythonItemExporter` class. The function is designed to serialize different types of values, including handling special cases for `BaseItem`, `dict`, and lists.

The bug occurs because the function checks if the input `value` is list-like, but it doesn't provide an implementation for the `is_listlike()` function. Additionally, the conditional checks for specific types such as `BaseItem` and `dict` could lead to unexpected behavior for other data types.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle list-like values using Python's `isinstance()` function rather than relying on an undefined `is_listlike()` function. Additionally, the type checks for `BaseItem` and `dict` should be re-evaluated to handle more generic cases.

Here's the corrected code for the `_serialize_value` function:

```python
def _serialize_value(self, value):
    if isinstance(value, BaseItem):
        return self.export_item(value)
    elif isinstance(value, dict):
        return {k: self._serialize_value(v) for k, v in value.items()}
    elif isinstance(value, (list, tuple)):
        return [self._serialize_value(v) for v in value]
    elif self.binary:
        return to_bytes(value, encoding=self.encoding)
    else:
        return to_unicode(value, encoding=self.encoding)
```

With this correction, the function will correctly handle list-like values and ensure that the serialization process works as expected for various data types.
