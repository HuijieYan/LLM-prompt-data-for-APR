Potential error location: The main issue with the provided function is that it doesn't have a proper handling for the case when the input value is not an instance of BaseItem, a dictionary, or a list-like object.

Reasons behind the bug: The function doesn't provide a default behavior for handling values that do not fall into the specified categories. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors when the function is called with an unsupported input type.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Adding a default behavior for handling unsupported input types can help address this issue. This can be done by returning the input value as is or by applying a generic serialization method to it.

Corrected code:

```python
def _serialize_value(self, value):
    if isinstance(value, BaseItem):
        return self.export_item(value)
    elif isinstance(value, dict):
        return dict(self._serialize_dict(value))
    elif is_listlike(value):
        return [self._serialize_value(v) for v in value]
    elif self.binary:
        return to_bytes(value, encoding=self.encoding)
    else:
        return to_unicode(value, encoding=self.encoding)
```
