The error occurs in the `_safe_ParseResult` function, specifically when encoding the netloc value using the `idna` encoding. This encoding is causing the error, likely due to an empty or too long label in the netloc value.

To fix this bug, you can handle the encoding of the netloc value separately to ensure that it does not cause any errors. You can also catch any `UnicodeError` exceptions that occur during encoding and handle them appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `_safe_ParseResult` function:

```python
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes, to_native_str
from urllib.parse import quote

def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf-8', path_encoding='utf-8'):
    netloc = parts.netloc.encode('idna').decode('utf-8', 'ignore')  # handle idna encoding separately
    try:
        result = (
            to_native_str(parts.scheme),
            netloc,
            quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
            quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
            quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
            quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
        )
        return result
    except UnicodeError as e:
        # handle UnicodeError exception here, e.g., log the error and return an empty result
        print("Error occurred:", e)
        return ("", "", "", "", "", "")  # return empty values in case of exception
```

In the corrected code, the netloc value is encoded using the `idna` encoding separately and then decoded using the `utf-8` encoding to handle any potential errors. Additionally, a try-except block is used to catch any `UnicodeError` exceptions that occur during encoding and handle them appropriately, such as logging the error and returning empty values.
