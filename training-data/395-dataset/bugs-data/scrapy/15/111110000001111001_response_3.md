Potential Error Location:
The error is occurring in the part of the function that deals with encoding the parts of the URL. The function is attempting to encode the netloc attribute using the 'idna' encoding, which is unnecessary.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug is occurring because the function is trying to unnecessarily encode the netloc attribute using 'idna' encoding. Since netloc is already a string, it does not need to be encoded, and this is causing the error.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Remove the unnecessary encoding of parts.netloc.
2. Ensure that all other parts of the URL are appropriately encoded using the specified encoding.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
from urllib.parse import quote, quote_to_bytes

def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        parts.netloc,  # netloc does not need to be encoded
        quote_to_bytes(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote_to_bytes(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote_to_bytes(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote_to_bytes(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
    )
```
