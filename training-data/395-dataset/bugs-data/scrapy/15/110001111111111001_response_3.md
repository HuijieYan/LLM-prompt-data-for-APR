Potential error location: The error seems to be originating from the `_safe_ParseResult` function, particularly from the line `to_native_str(parts.netloc.encode('idna'))`. 

Reason behind the bug: The `encode('idna')` method on `netloc` could lead to a UnicodeError due to invalid characters or a label that is empty or too long when it's encoded to the IDNA (Internationalized Domain Names in Applications) format.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Check the length of the `netloc` and ensure that it adheres to the length limitations for DNS labels.
2. Handle the UnicodeError exception and provide a suitable fallback mechanism to handle cases where the `netloc` cannot be encoded to the IDNA format.

Here's the corrected code for the `_safe_ParseResult` function:

```python
def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    netloc = parts.netloc
    encoded_netloc = ''
    try:
        # Encode the netloc to IDNA (Internationalized Domain Names in Applications) format
        encoded_netloc = to_native_str(netloc.encode('idna'))
    except UnicodeError:
        # Handle UnicodeError and provide a fallback mechanism
        encoded_netloc = netloc.encode('idna', errors='replace').decode('utf-8')

    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        encoded_netloc,
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `netloc` is handled to address potential UnicodeError exceptions, and if the encoding fails, it falls back to replacing the errors and decoding it back to 'utf-8'. This ensures that the function can handle edge cases where the netloc contains invalid characters or labels.
