The error occurs when trying to encode the `netloc` part using the 'idna' codec. This error is caused by passing an invalid value for `netloc` (with extra dot characters) which causes the label to be empty or too long.

To fix this issue, we can identify and remove any leading or trailing dots from the `netloc` before encoding it using the 'idna' codec.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    netloc = parts.netloc.lstrip('.').rstrip('.')  # Remove leading and trailing dots
    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        to_native_str(netloc.encode('idna')),  # Encode the modified netloc

        # default encoding for path component SHOULD be UTF-8
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),

        # encoding of query and fragment follows page encoding
        # or form-charset (if known and passed)
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
    )
```

This code modifies the `netloc` value before encoding it using the 'idna' codec, which should prevent the error caused by an invalid netloc value.
