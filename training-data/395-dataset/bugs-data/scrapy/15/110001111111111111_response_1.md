The error occurs when trying to encode the `netloc` part of the URL using the 'idna' codec. The error message "label empty or too long" indicates that the `netloc` value is causing the problem.

The issue arises because the `netloc` value is directly encoded using the 'idna' codec without proper validation. The 'idna' codec is used to encode domain names to ASCII-compatible format, and it requires the domain name labels to be non-empty and not too long.

To fix this issue, the `netloc` value should be validated before encoding it using the 'idna' codec. If it is found to be empty or too long, appropriate measures should be taken to handle the situation.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, quote

def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    netloc = parts.netloc
    if len(netloc) == 0 or len(netloc) > 253:
        # Handle the empty or too long netloc value
        # For example, return an error or replace with a default value
        # Here, we are replacing it with a default value for demonstration
        netloc = 'example.com'
    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        to_native_str(netloc.encode('idna')),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
    )
```

In this corrected function, the `netloc` value is validated before encoding. If it is empty or too long, you can handle the situation according to the requirements, for example, by raising an error or using a default value.

This modification ensures that the 'idna' encoding is only applied to valid `netloc` values, avoiding the UnicodeError that was occurring.
