The potential error in the given function is the use of `parts.netloc.encode('idna')` without specifying the encoding. This can lead to unexpected behavior when encoding non-ASCII characters in the netloc, especially if it contains characters outside of the ASCII range.

The function is also using `to_bytes` and `to_native_str` without providing their definitions, so it's unclear how these functions are implemented or if they are necessary.

To fix the bug, we can simplify the encoding of `parts.netloc` using the specified `encoding` parameter. We also need to ensure that the `to_bytes` and `to_native_str` functions are defined appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    return (
        parts.scheme,
        parts.netloc.encode(encoding).decode(encoding),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
    )
```

It's important to note that the `quote` function is still being used assuming it's properly implemented.

This corrected code uses the specified encoding for encoding the netloc and path components, and uses `parts.scheme` directly without any unnecessary conversions.
