The error is occurring in the `_safe_ParseResult` function specifically when attempting to encode the `netloc` part of the URL using the 'idna' encoding. The error message indicates a UnicodeError stating "label empty or too long". This error arises due to incorrect handling of the netloc encoding process.

The bug occurs because the original code attempts to encode the netloc part of the URL using the 'idna' encoding, but does not consider the possibility that the netloc may be empty or too long, which leads to a UnicodeError. 

To fix this bug, the function should first check if the netloc is empty or too long before attempting to encode it using the 'idna' encoding.

Here's the corrected code for the `_safe_ParseResult` function:

```python
def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    netloc = parts.netloc
    if netloc:
        netloc = to_native_str(parts.netloc.encode('idna'))

    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        netloc,

        # default encoding for path component SHOULD be UTF-8
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),

        # encoding of query and fragment follows page encoding
        # or form-charset (if known and passed)
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
    )
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the netloc is empty or too long. If it's neither, then we proceed with encoding it using the 'idna' encoding. Otherwise, we leave the netloc as is in the result tuple.
