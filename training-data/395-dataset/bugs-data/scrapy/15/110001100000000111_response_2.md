The potential error location within the problematic function is the `to_native_str(parts.netloc.encode('idna'))` line, which is trying to encode the netloc using 'idna', but it seems to be causing a UnicodeError in some cases.

The bug occurs because the `parts.netloc` may not always be a valid value for encoding with IDNA. This can happen due to invalid characters in the netloc or in cases where the netloc is empty.

To fix the bug, we can handle the encoding of `parts.netloc` separately and ensure that it is a valid value for IDNA encoding. If it's not valid, we can handle such cases gracefully.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, quote
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes, to_native_str

def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    scheme = to_native_str(parts.scheme)
    netloc = parts.netloc
    if netloc:
        try:
            netloc = netloc.encode('idna')
        except UnicodeError:
            pass  # handle the exception gracefully, e.g. by using the original netloc
    path = quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), safe=_safe_chars)
    params = quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), safe=_safe_chars)
    query = quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), safe=_safe_chars)
    fragment = quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), safe=_safe_chars)

    return (scheme, to_native_str(netloc), path, params, query, fragment)
```

In this corrected code, we first check if `parts.netloc` is a valid value for encoding with IDNA. If it is, we proceed with encoding it. If not, we handle the exception gracefully and use the original netloc value. This should prevent the UnicodeError from occurring and allow the function to handle such cases more robustly.
