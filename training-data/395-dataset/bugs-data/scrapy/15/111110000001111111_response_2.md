The potential error location within the problematic function is when trying to encode `parts.netloc` using 'idna'. This is where the UnicodeError is occurring.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the _safe_ParseResult function is attempting to encode the parts.netloc using the 'idna' encoding, which is causing the UnicodeError when the netloc is too long.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to handle the UnicodeError when encoding the netloc. We can use a try-except block to catch the UnicodeError and handle it gracefully.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import urllib.parse

def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    try:
        netloc = to_native_str(parts.netloc.encode('idna'))
    except UnicodeError:
        netloc = to_native_str(parts.netloc)
    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        netloc,
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
    )
```
