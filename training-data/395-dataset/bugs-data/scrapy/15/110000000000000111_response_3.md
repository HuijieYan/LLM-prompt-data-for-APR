Potential error location: The error message "exceptions.UnicodeError: label empty or too long" indicates that there is an issue with encoding the netloc part of the URL.

Reasons for the bug: The code is trying to encode the netloc using the 'idna' encoding, but it seems that the netloc might be empty or too long, causing the UnicodeError to be raised.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Check if the netloc is empty before encoding it. If it's empty, then skip the encoding step.
2. Add error handling to gracefully handle cases where the netloc is too long or contains invalid characters.

Corrected code:

```python
from urllib.parse import quote, urlparse

def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    netloc = parts.netloc.encode('idna') if parts.netloc else b''
    
    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        to_native_str(netloc),

        # default encoding for path component SHOULD be UTF-8
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),

        # encoding of query and fragment follows page encoding
        # or form-charset (if known and passed)
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
    )
```

In the corrected code, we added a check for the netloc before encoding it. If the netloc is empty, we set it to an empty byte string. This should prevent the UnicodeError from occurring when encoding the netloc.
