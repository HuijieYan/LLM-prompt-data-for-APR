The error seems to be occurring in the `_safe_ParseResult` function when trying to encode the `netloc` using the 'idna' codec. This is likely because the `netloc` value is not valid for encoding with the 'idna' codec.

The reason for the bug is that the `netloc` value is not being properly processed before it is being encoded using the 'idna' codec. The 'idna' codec is used for encoding domain names according to the Internationalizing Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) standard, and it has specific requirements for valid domain names.

To fix this bug, we can modify the handling of `netloc` before trying to encode it with the 'idna' codec. This can involve checking the validity of the `netloc` and processing it accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_safe_ParseResult` function:

```python
def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    netloc = parts.netloc
    if '@' in netloc:
        # If there is a username:password@ part, leave it alone
        userpass, netloc = netloc.rsplit('@', 1)
    netloc = netloc.encode('idna').decode('utf-8')
    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        netloc,
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
    )
```

In this corrected code, we first check if there is a username:password@ part in the `netloc` and handle it accordingly. Then, the `netloc` is encoded using the 'idna' codec and decoded back to UTF-8 to ensure it is in the correct format.

This approach should handle the `netloc` properly and prevent the UnicodeError related to the 'idna' codec.
