The issue in the provided code is related to the encoding of the netloc part of the URL. The error message "exceptions.UnicodeError: label empty or too long" indicates that there is an issue with the encoding of the netloc.

The potential error location is in the part where the netloc is being encoded using 'idna'. This encoding may not handle certain characters properly, leading to the UnicodeError.

The bug occurs because the netloc part of the URL is being encoded using 'idna', which may not handle all characters properly. This can lead to the UnicodeError when processing certain URLs.

To fix the bug, it's recommended to use a different approach for encoding the netloc. One possible approach is to use the `to_bytes` function with the specified encoding ('utf8' in this case) without using 'idna' encoding. Additionally, handling exceptions related to encoding should be considered to ensure that even if one bad link exists in the response, all other good links can still be extracted.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import quote, urlparse

_safe_chars = '/:-_.*~'
def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        to_native_str(parts.netloc),

        # default encoding for path component SHOULD be UTF-8
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),

        # encoding of query and fragment follows page encoding
        # or form-charset (if known and passed)
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `to_bytes` function is used without using 'idna' encoding for the netloc part of the URL. This should prevent the UnicodeError caused by the 'idna' encoding. Additionally, the function `to_native_str` is being used, assuming it's properly defined elsewhere.
