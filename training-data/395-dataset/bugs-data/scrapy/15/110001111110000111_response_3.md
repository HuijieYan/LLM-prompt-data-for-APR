The error occurs in the `canonicalize_url` function when it tries to encode the netloc using the IDNA encoding. The error message indicates that the label is empty or too long.

The potential error location is in the `canonicalize_url` function where it tries to encode the netloc using the 'idna' encoding.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is trying to encode an empty or excessively long label using the IDNA encoding, which is causing the UnicodeError.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_safe_ParseResult` function to properly encode the netloc using the `idna` encoding and handle the case when the label is empty or too long.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, quote, ParseResult
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes, to_native_str

def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    netloc = to_bytes(parts.netloc, 'utf-8').decode('idna')
    
    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        netloc,

        # default encoding for path component SHOULD be UTF-8
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), safe=_safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), safe=_safe_chars),

        # encoding of query and fragment follows page encoding
        # or form-charset (if known and passed)
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), safe=_safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), safe=_safe_chars)
    )
```

In the corrected code:
- We use `to_bytes(parts.netloc, 'utf-8').decode('idna')` to properly encode the netloc using the `idna` encoding.
- We also use the `safe` parameter in the `quote` function to specify which characters should not be percent-encoded.

These modifications should fix the bug and prevent the UnicodeError from occurring.
