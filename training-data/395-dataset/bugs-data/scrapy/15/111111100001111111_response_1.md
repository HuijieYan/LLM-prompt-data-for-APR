The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `to_native_str(parts.netloc.encode('idna'))`. The error occurs because the netloc value is longer than expected, causing the label to be too long.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the netloc value exceeds the maximum length allowed for the IDNA encoding.

To fix this bug, you can modify the function to check the length of the netloc value and handle cases where it exceeds the allowed length.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
from urllib.parse import quote, urlparse

_safe_chars = '/'


def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    netloc = parts.netloc
    if len(netloc) > 253:
        netloc = netloc[:253]  # Truncate the netloc if it exceeds 253 characters
    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        to_native_str(netloc.encode('idna')),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
    )
```

In the corrected code, we added a check for the length of the netloc value and truncated it if it exceeds the maximum length allowed for IDNA encoding. This prevents the UnicodeError from occurring due to a label that is too long.
