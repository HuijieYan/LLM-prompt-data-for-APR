The error is occurring in the `_safe_ParseResult` function in the `/Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_15/scrapy/utils/url.py` file.

The error is caused by the `parts.netloc.encode('idna')` statement. The `encode('idna')` method is used to convert the domain name into its IDNA (Internationalized Domain Names in Applications) encoding format. However, for some input values, this encoding process fails and raises a UnicodeError.

To fix this bug, we can modify the encoding section of the `_safe_ParseResult` function to handle the UnicodeError gracefully. We can catch the UnicodeError and handle it by setting the `netloc` value to an empty string if the label is too long or empty.

Here's the corrected code for the `_safe_ParseResult` function:

```python
def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    netloc = parts.netloc
    try:
        netloc = to_native_str(parts.netloc.encode('idna'))
    except UnicodeError:
        netloc = ''
    
    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        netloc,

        # default encoding for path component SHOULD be UTF-8
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),

        # encoding of query and fragment follows page encoding
        # or form-charset (if known and passed)
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
    )
```

In this corrected code, we've added a try-except block to handle the UnicodeError that might occur during the encoding process. If a UnicodeError is raised, we set the `netloc` value to an empty string. This prevents the UnicodeError from propagating and crashing the program.

With this modification, the `_safe_ParseResult` function should handle the IDNA encoding more gracefully and prevent the UnicodeError from occurring.
