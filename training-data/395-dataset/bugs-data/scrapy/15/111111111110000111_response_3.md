The error occurs when trying to encode the `netloc` part using the 'idna' codec. The error message indicates that the label is either empty or too long. This issue results from the input domain being either empty or containing a label that is too long, leading to a failure in the idna encoding step.

To fix this issue, it is necessary to ensure that the domain is valid and does not contain empty or excessively long labels before attempting to encode it using the 'idna' codec.

Here's the corrected code for the `_safe_ParseResult` function:

```python
def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    netloc = parts.netloc
    # Check if netloc is empty or contains excessively long labels
    if netloc and all(0 < len(label) < 64 for label in netloc.split('.')):
        return (
            to_native_str(parts.scheme),
            to_native_str(parts.netloc.encode('idna')),
            quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
            quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
            quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
            quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
        )
    else:
        # Return an error message or handle the empty or excessively long label as per the specific use case
        return None  # or raise an exception, log a warning, etc.
```

In this corrected code, we first check if the `netloc` is not empty and if all labels within the `netloc` are not excessively long. If these conditions are met, the encoding proceeds as before. If the conditions are not met, you can choose to handle the issue accordingly, such as raising an exception, logging a warning, or returning an error message.
