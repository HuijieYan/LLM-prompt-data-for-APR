Potential Error Location:
The error seems to be occurring in the line `to_native_str(parts.netloc.encode('idna'))`. This is where the encoding with the 'idna' codec is failing, resulting in a UnicodeError.

Reason for the Bug:
The issue is likely due to the fact that the `parts.netloc` value contains a leading dot (.) which is causing the Unicode encoding with the 'idna' codec to fail. According to the error message, it seems like the IDNA implementation is being very strict and doesn't support the input format provided.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check and handle the case where `parts.netloc` contains a leading dot (.) before encoding with the 'idna' codec.
2. Ensure that the input to the 'idna' codec is compliant with the requirements of the IDNA specification.

Corrected Code:

```python
from urllib.parse import quote, to_bytes, to_native_str

def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    # Check if netloc contains a leading dot, remove it temporarily for encoding
    netloc = parts.netloc
    if netloc.startswith('.'):
        netloc = netloc.lstrip('.')
    
    encoded_netloc = netloc.encode('idna')
    
    # Add the dot back to the encoded netloc if it was removed
    if parts.netloc.startswith('.'):
        encoded_netloc = b'.' + encoded_netloc
    
    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        to_native_str(encoded_netloc),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), safe='/'),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), safe='/'),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), safe='/'),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), safe='/')
    )
```

In the corrected code, we handle the case where `parts.netloc` contains a leading dot (.) by temporarily removing it before encoding with the 'idna' codec. After encoding, we add the dot back to the encoded netloc if it was initially present. This should resolve the UnicodeError encountered in the original code.
