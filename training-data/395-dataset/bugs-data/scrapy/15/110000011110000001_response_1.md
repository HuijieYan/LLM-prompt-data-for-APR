The error message indicates a UnicodeError occurring at the line `to_native_str(parts.netloc.encode('idna'))` in the `_safe_ParseResult` function. This suggests that the encoding with 'idna' codec is failing due to a label either being empty or too long. 

The issue is likely occurring because the `parts.netloc` is not being properly processed before attempting to encode it with the 'idna' codec.

To fix the bug:
1. First, the `parts.netloc` should be converted to native string using the `to_native_str` function.
2. Then the resulting string should be encoded using the 'idna' codec.

Here's the corrected `_safe_ParseResult` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import quote
from scrapy.utils.python import to_native_str, to_bytes

def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        parts.netloc, # converting netloc to a native string
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
    )
```
