Potential error location: 

The error seems to be occurring in the `_safe_ParseResult` function in the `url.py` file, specifically in the line `to_native_str(parts.netloc.encode('idna'))`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:

The `encode('idna')` method is raising a UnicodeError because it is unable to handle certain characters in the URL, resulting in a "label empty or too long" error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Check for any empty or invalid labels in the URL before encoding 'idna' and skip encoding if necessary.
2. Use a try-except block to catch the UnicodeError and handle it gracefully without disrupting the extraction of other links.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, quote

# This is the corrected version of the function
def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf-8', path_encoding='utf-8'):
    try:
        netloc = to_native_str(parts.netloc.encode('idna'))
    except UnicodeError:
        netloc = parts.netloc
    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        netloc,
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
    )
```

In the corrected code, we added a try-except block to handle the UnicodeError. If the encoding raises a UnicodeError, we simply use the original `parts.netloc` without encoding it. This allows the extraction of other links to continue even if there is an issue with a specific URL.
