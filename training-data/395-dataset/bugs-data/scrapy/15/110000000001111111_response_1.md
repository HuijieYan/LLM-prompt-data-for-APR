The error message indicates a UnicodeError related to the label being empty or too long. This error is likely occurring in the `_safe_ParseResult` function.

The reason for the bug is that the function is trying to encode `parts.netloc` using 'idna', but in some cases, the value of `parts.netloc` is too long, leading to the UnicodeError.

To fix this bug, we can handle the encoding of `parts.netloc` separately and avoid encoding it if it's too long.

Here's the corrected code for the `_safe_ParseResult` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import quote, urlparse

def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    scheme = parts.scheme
    netloc = parts.netloc if len(parts.netloc) < 253 else parts.netloc[:252]  # Truncate netloc if it's too long
    path = quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars)
    params = quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars)
    query = quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars)
    fragment = quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)

    return (to_native_str(scheme), to_native_str(netloc), path, params, query, fragment)
```

In the corrected function, we check the length of `parts.netloc` and truncate it if it's longer than 253 characters. This prevents the UnicodeError from occurring.
