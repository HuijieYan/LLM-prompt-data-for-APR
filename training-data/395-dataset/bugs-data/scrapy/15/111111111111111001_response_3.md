The bug appears to be within the `netloc` part of the `_safe_ParseResult` function. The error message provided points to a UnicodeError caused by encoding with the 'idna' codec failing due to the label being empty or too long.

The issue occurs because the `to_native_str` function is being used on `parts.netloc` which is then being encoded with 'idna'. This is causing the UnicodeError due to invalid input.

One approach to fixing the bug is to use the `parts.netloc` directly without encoding it with 'idna', as it is already a part of the ParseResult object.

Here's the corrected code for the `_safe_ParseResult` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import quote

def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        to_native_str(parts.netloc),

        # default encoding for path component SHOULD be UTF-8
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),

        # encoding of query and fragment follows page encoding
        # or form-charset (if known and passed)
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
    )
```
