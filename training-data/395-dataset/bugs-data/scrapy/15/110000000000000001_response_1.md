Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the code is with the use of the `to_bytes` function, which is not a built-in Python function. This function appears to be attempting to convert a string to bytes, but it is not a valid operation in the provided context.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The `to_bytes` function is not a standard Python function, and it is likely a custom function that was intended to convert a string to bytes. However, since it is not a built-in function, it is causing an error in the code.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the code to use the `encode` method for converting strings to bytes, as it is the standard way to achieve this in Python.
2. Replace the `to_bytes` function calls with the `encode` method, specifying the desired encoding.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        to_native_str(parts.netloc.encode('idna')),
        quote(parts.path.encode(path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(parts.params.encode(path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(parts.query.encode(encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(parts.fragment.encode(encoding), _safe_chars)
    )
```
In the corrected code, the `to_bytes` calls have been replaced with the `encode` method, using the specified encodings for path, params, query, and fragment components.
