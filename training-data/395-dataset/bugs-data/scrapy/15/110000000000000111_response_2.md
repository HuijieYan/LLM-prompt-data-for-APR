The issue seems to be related to encoding errors when trying to encode the netloc using 'idna'.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the following line:
```
to_native_str(parts.netloc.encode('idna')),
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the netloc may not be valid under the 'idna' encoding, causing the UnicodeError to be raised.

To fix this bug, we can modify the code to handle the UnicodeError and continue processing the remaining links. We can use a try-except block to catch the UnicodeError and log the problematic link while continuing to process the other links.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import logging

def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    try:
        netloc = to_native_str(parts.netloc.encode('idna'))
    except UnicodeError:
        logging.error("Error encoding netloc: {}".format(parts.netloc))
        netloc = ''
        
    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        netloc,

        # default encoding for path component SHOULD be UTF-8
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),

        # encoding of query and fragment follows page encoding
        # or form-charset (if known and passed)
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
    )
```
