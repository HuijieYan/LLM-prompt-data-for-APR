The error message indicates that there is an issue with encoding using the 'idna' codec, specifically with the `parts.netloc.encode('idna')` line of the `_safe_ParseResult` function. This suggests that there is a problem with the domain name encoding.

The problem occurs because the netloc (domain) is incorrectly being encoded using 'idna'. This causes the 'label empty or too long' error because the domain name encoding is not handled properly.

To fix the bug, we should only encode the domain name using 'idna' if it contains non-ASCII characters. If the domain name is already ASCII, there is no need to encode it.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    netloc = parts.netloc
    if any(ord(c) > 128 for c in netloc):  # Check if the netloc contains non-ASCII characters
        netloc = netloc.encode('idna')  # Encode netloc using 'idna'
    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        to_native_str(netloc),

        # default encoding for path component SHOULD be UTF-8
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),

        # encoding of query and fragment follows page encoding
        # or form-charset (if known and passed)
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
    )
```

In the corrected code, we check if the netloc contains non-ASCII characters. If it does, we encode it using 'idna'. If it is already ASCII, we leave it as is. This approach ensures that the domain name is encoded properly and prevents the 'label empty or too long' error.
