Potential Error Location: 
The potential error in the given function is the encoding of the netloc part using 'idna' which is unnecessary and could lead to potential encoding issues.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The unnecessary encoding of the netloc part using 'idna' can cause encoding issues, as it is already converted to native string using `to_native_str`. This can lead to double encoding and incorrect representation of the netloc.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Remove the unnecessary encoding of netloc using 'idna'.
2. Use proper encoding for the path, params, query, and fragment components.

Corrected code:
```python
def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf-8', path_encoding='utf-8'):
    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        to_native_str(parts.netloc),

        # default encoding for path component SHOULD be UTF-8
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),

        # encoding of query and fragment follows page encoding
        # or form-charset (if known and passed)
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
    )
```
