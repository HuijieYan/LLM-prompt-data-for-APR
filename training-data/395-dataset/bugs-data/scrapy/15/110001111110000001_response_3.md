Potential error location: 
The error occurs in the `_safe_ParseResult` function between lines 4-12 where the `parts.netloc` is being encoded using the 'idna' codec.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug is occurring because the `parts.netloc` is being encoded using the 'idna' codec, and the label being used is either empty or too long.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Verify the `parts.netloc` before encoding it, and if it is empty or too long, handle it accordingly.
2. Add exception handling for the possible errors that might occur during the encoding of `parts.netloc`.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    netloc = parts.netloc.encode('idna')
    if not netloc:  # check if netloc is empty
        netloc = b'.'
    elif len(netloc) > 253:  # check if netloc is too long
        netloc = netloc[:253]
    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        to_native_str(netloc),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
    )
