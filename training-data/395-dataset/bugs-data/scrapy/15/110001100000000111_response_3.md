The error in the provided function seems to be related to the processing of the netloc part of the URL. The error message "exceptions.UnicodeError: label empty or too long" indicates that there is a problem with the netloc part of the URL.

The bug occurs because the function is trying to encode the netloc part using 'idna' encoding, which might not be necessary. This is probably causing the UnicodeError when the label is empty or too long.

To fix the bug, we can remove the encoding of the netloc part and just use to_native_str to convert it to a native string.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        to_native_str(parts.netloc),

        # default encoding for path component SHOULD be UTF-8
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),

        # encoding of query and fragment follows page encoding
        # or form-charset (if known and passed)
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
    )
```

By making this change, we avoid unnecessary encoding of the netloc part and the issue with the UnicodeError should be resolved.
