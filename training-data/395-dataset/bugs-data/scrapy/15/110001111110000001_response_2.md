The error occurs when the `to_native_str` function is trying to encode the `parts.netloc` using the 'idna' codec. The error message "UnicodeError: encoding with 'idna' codec failed" indicates that there is an issue with encoding using the 'idna' codec.

The bug is likely occurring because the `parts.netloc` may already be in Unicode format, and encoding it with 'idna' again is causing the problem.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `to_native_str` function to handle Unicode encoding properly and remove the unnecessary encoding with the 'idna' codec for `parts.netloc`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import quote, to_bytes, ParseResult

# this is the corrected function
def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        to_native_str(parts.netloc),

        # default encoding for path component SHOULD be UTF-8
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),

        # encoding of query and fragment follows page encoding
        # or form-charset (if known and passed)
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the unnecessary encoding of `parts.netloc` using the 'idna' codec has been removed.
