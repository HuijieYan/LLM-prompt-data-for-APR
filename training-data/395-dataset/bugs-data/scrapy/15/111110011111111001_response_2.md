The bug occurs when trying to encode the netloc value using the 'idna' codec, resulting in a UnicodeError: label empty or too long. This happens because the netloc value is being encoded unnecessarily.

To fix the bug, the encoding of the netloc should be removed, and the netloc itself should be converted to a native string.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        to_native_str(parts.netloc),  # Convert netloc to native string

        # default encoding for path component SHOULD be UTF-8
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),

        # encoding of query and fragment follows the page encoding
        # or form-charset (if known and passed)
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
    )
```
This corrected code removes the unnecessary encoding of the netloc, resolving the UnicodeError issue.
