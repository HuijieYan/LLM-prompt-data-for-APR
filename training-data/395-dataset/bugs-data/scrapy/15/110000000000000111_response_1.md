Potential error location: The error is occurring in the `idna` encoding part of the code. The `parts.netloc` is being encoded using 'idna', but it is raising a UnicodeError.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug is likely happening because the `parts.netloc` is either empty or too long, causing the `idna` encoding to fail.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if `parts.netloc` is empty before encoding it with 'idna'.
2. If `parts.netloc` is too long, handle the long data appropriately by either truncating or skipping it.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import quote, urlparse

def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    netloc = parts.netloc
    if netloc:  # Check if netloc is not empty
        netloc = netloc.encode('idna')  # Encode netloc using 'idna'

    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        to_native_str(netloc),

        # Default encoding for path should be UTF-8
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),

        # Encoding of query and fragment follows page encoding
        # or form-charset (if known and passed)
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
    )
```
