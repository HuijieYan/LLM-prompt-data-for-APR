The error occurs due to the use of the `parts.netloc.encode('idna')` line in the `_safe_ParseResult` function. This line is attempting to encode the netloc using the 'idna' encoding, which can sometimes result in a UnicodeError.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `_safe_ParseResult` function to handle the encoding of the netloc more robustly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_safe_ParseResult` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import quote, urlparse
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes, to_native_str

def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    netloc = parts.netloc.encode('idna').decode('utf-8', 'ignore')
    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        netloc,

        # default encoding for path component SHOULD be UTF-8
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),

        # encoding of query and fragment follows page encoding
        # or form-charset (if known and passed)
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
    )
```

In the corrected function, we first encode the netloc using the 'idna' encoding and then decode it back to UTF-8. This approach should handle the encoding more reliably and prevent the UnicodeError that was occurring.
