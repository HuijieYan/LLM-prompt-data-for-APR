The error is likely occurring in the `_safe_ParseResult` function. The error message indicates that there is an issue with encoding using the 'idna' codec, resulting in a UnicodeError due to a label being empty or too long.

The issue is likely caused by the attempt to encode the `netloc` value using the 'idna' codec. The netloc value may contain characters that are not compatible with the 'idna' encoding, resulting in the error.

To fix the bug, the encoding of the `netloc` value should be handled more carefully. This could involve checking the length and format of the `netloc` value before attempting to encode it using the 'idna' codec. In case of an invalid `netloc` value, it may need to be normalized or handled differently to avoid the UnicodeError.

Here's the corrected code for the `_safe_ParseResult` function:
```python
def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    netloc = parts.netloc.encode('idna').decode('utf-8', 'ignore')
    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        to_native_str(netloc),

        # default encoding for path component SHOULD be UTF-8
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),

        # encoding of query and fragment follows page encoding
        # or form-charset (if known and passed)
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
    )
```
This corrected code includes decoding the `netloc` value after encoding it using the 'idna' codec. Additionally, it utilizes the 'ignore' parameter to handle any characters that are incompatible with the utf-8 encoding.
