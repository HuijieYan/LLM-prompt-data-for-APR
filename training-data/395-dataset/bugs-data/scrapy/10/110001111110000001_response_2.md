The test case `test_utf8_location` is failing with an AssertionError. The error message indicates that the expected URL and the actual URL are not matching due to encoding differences.

The potential error location within the `process_response` function is the conversion of the response headers' location to a native string using the `to_native_str` and decoding it with 'latin1'.

The bug occurred because the response header location was being decoded using 'latin1', which resulted in incorrect decoding of the UTF-8 encoded URL.

To fix the bug, we can directly decode the response headers' location with UTF-8 encoding. This will correctly decode the UTF-8 encoded URL.

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, response.headers['location'].decode('utf-8'))

    if response.status in (301, 307) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

With this fix, the response headers' location will be directly decoded with UTF-8 encoding, which should resolve the encoding issue.
