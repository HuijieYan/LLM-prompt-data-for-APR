The bug in the provided function is related to the decoding of the 'Location' header on redirects using latin-1 encoding. The function attempts to decode the 'Location' header using the latin1 encoding, but this can lead to incorrect decoding, as observed in the GitHub issue.

The potential error location within the function is the following line:
```python
location = to_native_str(response.headers['location'].decode('latin1'))
```
Here, the 'Location' header is being decoded using the latin1 encoding, which can lead to incorrect decoding of the redirected URL.

To fix this bug, a possible approach is to update the decoding method to use the appropriate encoding for decoding the 'Location' header. In this case, using the utf-8 encoding might be more appropriate, as indicated in the GitHub issue.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = response.headers['location'].decode('utf-8')  # Decode using utf-8 encoding

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```
