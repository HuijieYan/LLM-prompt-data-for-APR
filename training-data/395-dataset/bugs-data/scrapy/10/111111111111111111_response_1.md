The bug seems to be in the handling of the `Location` header in the `process_response` function. The `Location` header is decoded as "latin1", which results in the incorrect decoding of the UTF-8 encoded URL. This leads to the wrong URL in the returned request.

To fix the bug, the `Location` header should be decoded as UTF-8 instead of latin1 to ensure correct decoding of the URL.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` function:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    # Decoding the 'Location' header as UTF-8
    location = response.headers.getlist('Location')[0].decode('utf-8')

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

By decoding the `Location` header as UTF-8, the bug should be fixed and the correct URL should be returned in the request.
