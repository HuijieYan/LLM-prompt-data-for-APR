## Bug Analysis:

The bug occurs in the decoding of the 'Location' header in the `process_response` function of the `RedirectMiddleware` class. The `response.headers['Location']` is being decoded using 'latin1' encoding, which can lead to incorrect decoding.

## Reasons behind the Bug:

The bug occurs because the 'Location' header received is UTF-8 encoded, but it is being decoded using 'latin1'.

## Possible Approaches:

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the 'Location' header is decoded using the correct encoding (UTF-8) to correctly handle the redirected URL.

## Code Fix:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = response.headers.getlist('Location')[0].decode('utf-8')  # Decode using UTF-8
    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

In the corrected code, the 'Location' header is decoded using the 'utf-8' encoding to ensure correct decoding of the redirected URL. This approach fixes the bug and handles the redirected URL appropriately.
