Based on the error message, it seems that the issue is related to the handling of non-ASCII characters in the "Location" header of the HTTP response.

The bug occurs because the "Location" header is being incorrectly decoded as "latin1", resulting in the wrong URL being constructed when joining with the request URL.

To fix the bug, the decoding of the "Location" header should be done using the correct encoding. In this case, the "Location" header should be decoded using the "utf-8" encoding.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic "process_response" function:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response
    
    # HTTP header is ascii or latin1, redirected url will be percent-encoded utf-8
    location = to_native_str(response.headers['location'].decode('utf-8'))  # Decode using utf-8 encoding

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

By decoding the "Location" header using the "utf-8" encoding, non-ASCII characters will be correctly handled, and the bug should be fixed.
