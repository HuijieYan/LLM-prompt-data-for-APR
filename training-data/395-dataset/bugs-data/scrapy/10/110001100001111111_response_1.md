The bug occurs in the 'process_response' function of the 'RedirectMiddleware' class. The bug is related to the decoding of the "Location" header on redirects using the Latin-1 encoding, which can result in incorrect URLs.

The bug occurs because the code attempts to decode the "Location" header using the 'decode' method with the 'latin1' encoding. However, this can result in incorrect decoding for non-ASCII characters.

To fix the bug, the decoding of the "Location" header should be handled correctly to ensure that the redirected URL is decoded properly.

Here's the corrected code for the 'process_response' function:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (
        request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False)
        or response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])
        or response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', [])
        or request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)
    ):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location_bytes = response.headers.getlist('location')[0]
    location = location_bytes.decode('utf-8')

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

In this corrected code, the 'Location' header is accessed using 'response.headers.getlist('location')[0]' to ensure that it correctly handles multiple 'Location' headers if they exist. Then, the location is decoded using the 'utf-8' encoding to handle non-ASCII characters properly.
