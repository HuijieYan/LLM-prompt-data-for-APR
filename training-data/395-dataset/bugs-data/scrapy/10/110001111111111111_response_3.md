The bug occurs due to an incorrect decoding of the "Location" header in the response. The "Location" header is expected to contain an encoded URL, but it is being decoded using the `latin1` encoding, which is causing the bug. As a result, the URL is being decoded incorrectly.

To fix this bug, the "Location" header should be decoded using the `utf-8` encoding instead of `latin1`.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` function in the `RedirectMiddleware` class:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response
    
    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response
    
    location = response.headers.get('Location').decode('utf-8')  # Decode using utf-8
    
    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)
    
    if response.status in (301, 307) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
    
    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

With this correction, the "Location" header will be decoded using the correct encoding, and the bug related to the incorrect decoding of the URL will be fixed. The test case provided will pass as expected after this correction.
