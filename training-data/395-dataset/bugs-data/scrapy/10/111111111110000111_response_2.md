The test case test_utf8_location is failing because the Location header is being incorrectly decoded as "latin-1" in the process_response function. This leads to the incorrect generation of the redirected URL, causing the test to fail.

The potential error location is the line where the Location header is being decoded using latin1 in the process_response function: 

```python
location = to_native_str(response.headers['location'].decode('latin1'))
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the "Location" header is being decoded incorrectly. The URL in this header is UTF-8 encoded, but it's being decoded as latin1, leading to a mismatch in the URL.

To fix the bug, the "Location" header should be decoded as UTF-8 instead of latin1. This will ensure that the URL is correctly decoded and the redirected URL is generated accurately.

The corrected code for the process_response function is as follows:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response
    
    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response
    
    # HTTP header is ascii or latin1, redirected url will be percent-encoded utf-8
    location = response.headers['location'].decode('utf-8')
    
    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)
    
    if response.status in (301, 307) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
    
    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

By decoding the "Location" header using UTF-8 encoding, the issue with incorrect URL generation will be resolved.
