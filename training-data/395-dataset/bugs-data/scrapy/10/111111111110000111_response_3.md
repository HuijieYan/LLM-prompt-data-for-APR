The test case `test_utf8_location` is checking if the `process_response` method of the `RedirectMiddleware` class correctly handles a response with a UTF-8 encoded `Location` header. The expected result is a percent-encoded UTF-8 URL.

The error occurs in the `process_response` method when decoding the `Location` header. The function incorrectly decodes the header as "latin1" and then processes it, resulting in a wrong URL.

The bug occurs because the function assumes the encoding of the `Location` header is "latin1" and tries to decode it as such. This assumption leads to the incorrect processing and generation of the redirected URL.

To fix the bug, the correct encoding (UTF-8) should be explicitly specified when decoding the `Location` header.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` method of the `RedirectMiddleware` class:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    # Correctly decode the Location header using UTF-8 encoding
    location = response.headers['location'].decode('utf-8')

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

In this corrected code, the `Location` header is decoded using the correct UTF-8 encoding, ensuring that the redirected URL is generated accurately.
