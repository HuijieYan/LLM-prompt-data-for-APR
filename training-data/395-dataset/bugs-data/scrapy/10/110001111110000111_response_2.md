The error occurs when the "Location" header in the response is decoded as "latin1" in the `process_response` function. This decoding process leads to incorrect conversion of the URL, resulting in the mismatch between the expected and actual URLs in the test case.

The bug occurs because the "Location" header on redirects is decoded using the wrong encoding (latin1 instead of utf-8). As a result, the URL is incorrectly encoded, leading to the assertion error in the test case.

To fix this bug, the "Location" header in the response should be decoded using utf-8 encoding instead of latin1.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` function:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    # HTTP header is ascii or latin1, redirected url will be percent-encoded utf-8
    location = response.headers.get('location').decode('utf-8')

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

By decoding the "Location" header using utf-8 encoding, the bug is fixed and the test case should now pass without any assertion errors.
