Potential Error:
The potential error within the function is in the line where the code is trying to decode the 'location' from the response headers using the 'latin1' encoding. The usage of 'to_native_str' and 'urljoin' seems to be incorrect as well.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug is likely occurring because the decoding method and the usage of 'to_native_str' and 'urljoin' are not accurately implemented.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use the correct method to decode the 'location' from the response headers.
2. Fix the usage of 'to_native_str' and 'urljoin' to accurately obtain the redirected URL.

Corrected Code:
```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response
        
    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = response.headers['Location'].decode(response.headers.get_content_charset(failobj='utf-8'))
    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)
    
    if response.status in (301, 307) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```
