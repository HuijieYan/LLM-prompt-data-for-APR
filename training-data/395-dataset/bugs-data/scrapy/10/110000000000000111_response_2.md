The error occurs in the line `location = to_native_str(response.headers['location'].decode('latin1'))` where the 'Location' header is being decoded using 'latin1'. The issue is that some web servers do not always use encoded URLs in their 'Location' headers, leading to incorrect decoding.

One possible approach for fixing this bug is to decode the 'Location' header using UTF-8 encoding instead of 'latin1'. This will ensure that the decoding is performed correctly, regardless of the encoding used in the 'Location' header.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` method:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = response.headers['location'].decode('utf-8')

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

In the corrected code, the 'Location' header is decoded using UTF-8 encoding and the remaining logic remains unchanged. This will ensure that the decoding is performed correctly, addressing the bug where the decoded URL was incorrect.
