The error message from the test function indicates that the URL returned by the function `process_response` is not matching the expected URL. The difference is in the encoding of the characters in the URL.

The bug occurs in the `process_response` function, specifically in the following lines:
```python
location = to_native_str(response.headers['location'].decode('latin1'))
redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)
```

The issue is caused by incorrect handling of character encoding. The `decode('latin1')` method is used to decode the location header, but it should be decoded using UTF-8 encoding instead.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be modified to correctly handle the character encoding. Here's the corrected version of the `process_response` function:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
        response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
        response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
        request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = to_native_str(response.headers['Location'].decode('utf-8'))
    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

In the corrected function, the `decode('utf-8')` method is used to correctly decode the location header using UTF-8 encoding, ensuring that the URL is properly handled and the bug is fixed.
