The error occurs when decoding the 'Location' header using the latin-1 encoding, which results in an incorrect URL. This is because the 'Location' header is not always percent-encoded UTF-8, as web servers should use encoded URLs in their "Location" headers, but they don't always do.

To fix the bug, the decoding of the 'Location' header should be done using the correct encoding, which in this case is UTF-8. The percent-encoded URL should be decoded from latin-1 and then re-encoded to UTF-8 to get the correct redirected URL.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin
from scrapy.utils.python import to_unicode
from scrapy.http import Request
from scrapy.http import Response
from scrapy.downloadermiddlewares.redirect import RedirectMiddleware

def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307)
    if b'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = to_unicode(response.headers.getlist('location')[0])

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307) or request.method == b'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url.decode('latin-1').encode('utf-8'))
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url.decode('latin-1').encode('utf-8'))
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

In the corrected code, the 'Location' header is decoded using the `to_unicode` function to handle the decoding correctly. Then, the URL is percent-decoded from latin-1 and re-encoded to UTF-8 before using it to create the redirected request.
