Potential error location: 
The error is most likely occurring due to the incorrect handling of the URL encoding in the `process_response` function. The `location` variable is being decoded using the 'latin1' encoding, which may not produce the correct result for non-ascii characters.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The error is occurring because the decoding method used for the 'location' header is incorrect. The 'latin1' decoding is not suitable for non-ascii characters. Additionally, the encoding and decoding of the URL may not be handled correctly, leading to unexpected characters in the `redirected_url` variable.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the decoding method for the 'location' header to use utf-8 encoding, which is suitable for non-ascii characters.
2. Ensure that the URL encoding and decoding are handled correctly to avoid unexpected characters in the `redirected_url` variable.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = response.headers.getlist('Location')[0].decode('utf-8')  # Use utf-8 decoding for non-ascii characters
    
    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```
