The issue in the code seems to stem from the incorrect decoding of the "Location" header. The header is received as UTF-8 encoded, but the code attempts to decode it using latin1, leading to the wrong URL being generated.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the code to correctly decode the "Location" header using UTF-8 encoding.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import urllib.parse

def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    # Decode the Location header using UTF-8 encoding
    location = response.headers.get(b'Location').decode('utf-8')

    redirected_url = urllib.parse.urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

With this correction, the "Location" header will be correctly decoded using UTF-8 encoding, and the expected URL will be generated. This change should address the issue reported in the test case.
