The test case `test_utf8_location` is designed to check if the function `process_response` in the `RedirectMiddleware` class correctly handles the UTF-8 encoded location header in the response.

The error message shows that the expected URL `perc_encoded_utf8_url` is `'http://scrapytest.org/a%C3%A7%C3%A3o'` while the actual result URL `req_result.url` is `'http://scrapytest.org/a%C3%83%C2%A7%C3%83%C2%A3o'`.

The issue likely arises from how the `location` and `redirected_url` variables are being handled. The UTF-8 encoded characters are not being correctly percent-encoded in the URL, leading to the incorrect result.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the UTF-8 encoded characters in the location header are correctly percent-encoded in the `redirected_url` variable.

Here is the corrected code for the `process_response` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import quote

def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged) ...
    
    location = to_native_str(response.headers['location'].decode('latin1'))
    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, quote(location, safe=':/?=&'))
    
    if response.status in (301, 307) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
    
    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

In the corrected code, the `quote` function is used to percent-encode the UTF-8 encoded characters in the `location` before constructing the `redirected_url`. This ensures that the URL is correctly encoded and should resolve the issue observed in the test case.
