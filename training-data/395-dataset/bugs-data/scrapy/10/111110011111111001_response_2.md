The error occurs because the URL encoding is not correctly handled in the `process_response` function. The `location` variable is incorrectly decoded using `'latin1'` and then encoded using `'utf-8'`. This results in an incorrect conversion of the UTF-8 characters in the URL, leading to the `AssertionError` in the test.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the URL encoding and decoding are handled correctly according to the character encoding used.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` function:

```python
from w3lib.url import to_native_str
from urllib.parse import urljoin

class RedirectMiddleware(BaseRedirectMiddleware):
    """
    Handle redirection of requests based on response status and meta-refresh html tag
    """
    
    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (
            request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False)
            or response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])
            or response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', [])
            or request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)
        ):
            return response

        allowed_status = {301, 302, 303, 307}
        if b'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
            return response

        location = to_native_str(response.headers[b'Location'])
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

        if response.status in {301, 307} or request.method == 'HEAD':
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

In the corrected code, the `location` variable is directly decoded using `to_native_str` to handle character encoding correctly. The `redirected_url` is then obtained using `urljoin` and the correct URL is returned.

With this correction, the test case is expected to pass without any `AssertionError`.
