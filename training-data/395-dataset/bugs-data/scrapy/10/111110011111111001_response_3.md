The test case `test_utf8_location` creates a Request object `req` with URL 'http://scrapytest.org/first', a Response object `resp` with URL 'http://scrapytest.org/first', status 302, and headers containing a UTF-8 encoded location. The expected result is to compare the processed response URL with the UTF-8 encoded URL.

The error message indicates that the comparison of the processed response URL 'http://scrapytest.org/a%C3%A7%C3%A3o' with the expected URL 'http://scrapytest.org/a%C3%83%C2%A7%C3%83%C2%A3o' failed due to differences in the UTF-8 encoding.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the UTF-8 encoding for the location header in the response.

The bug occurs because the `to_native_str()` method is intended to decode URL-encoded data, but it is not handling UTF-8 encoding properly.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the UTF-8 encoding of the location header in the response.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` function:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    # ... (previous code)

    location_header = response.headers.get(b'Location')
    if location_header:
        if isinstance(location_header, list):
            location = location_header[0].decode('utf-8')
        else:
            location = location_header.decode('utf-8')

        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

        if response.status in (301, 307) or request.method == 'HEAD':
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    return response
```

In this corrected code, we directly decode the location header using UTF-8 encoding and handle the redirected URL accordingly, ensuring proper handling of UTF-8 encoding.
