1. The test case `test_utf8_location` is checking if the URL is correctly percent-encoded after processing the response. The error message shows that the encoded URL doesn't match the expected result.

2. The potential error location within the `process_response` function is the handling of the utf-8 encoded location header.

3. The bug occurs because the function is not correctly handling the utf-8 encoded location header. The decoding and processing of the location header seem to be incorrect, leading to the wrong percent-encoded URL.

4. To fix the bug, the function should properly handle the utf-8 encoded location header. This involves decoding the utf-8 encoded location to get the redirected URL and then properly percent-encoding it.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` function:

```python
from scrapy.utils.python import to_native_str
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    # HTTP header is utf-8 encoded, redirected url will be percent-encoded utf-8
    location = response.headers['location'].decode('utf-8')

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```
