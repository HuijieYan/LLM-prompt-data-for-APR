Potential error location: 
The error could be occurring in the `_redirect` and `_redirect_request_using_get` functions, as they are being called within the `process_response` function but are not defined within the given code snippet.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The `_redirect` and `_redirect_request_using_get` functions are being called within the `process_response` function but are not defined in the provided code snippet. This results in a NameError as these functions are not accessible.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define the `_redirect` and `_redirect_request_using_get` functions within the same file or another file where they are accessible.
2. Ensure that the defined `_redirect` and `_redirect_request_using_get` functions have the correct parameters and functionalities.

Corrected code:
```python
# Define the _redirect and _redirect_request_using_get functions
def _redirect(self, redirected, request, spider, reason):
    # ... implementation ...

def _redirect_request_using_get(self, request, redirect_url):
    # ... implementation ...

# Corrected process_response function
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    # HTTP header is ascii or latin1, redirected url will be percent-encoded utf-8
    location = to_native_str(response.headers['location'].decode('latin1'))

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```
