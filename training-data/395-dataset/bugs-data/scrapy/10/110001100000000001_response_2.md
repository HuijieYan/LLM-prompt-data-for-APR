Potential Error:
The potential error lies in the way the response status is being checked and handled. It seems that the logic for handling the response status codes and redirection is not correctly implemented.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the condition to check if the response status is in the allowed status codes (301, 302, 303, 307) is incorrect. The bug also stems from the use of incorrect comparison operators for response status and the way the redirection is handled.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Correct the condition to check if the response status is in the allowed status codes.
2. Use the proper comparison operators for response status.
3. Adjust the logic for redirection based on the response status and request method.

Corrected Code:
```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = to_native_str(response.headers['Location'].decode('latin1'))

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307) or request.method.upper() == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url, method='GET')
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```
