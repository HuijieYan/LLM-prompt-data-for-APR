The error message shows that there is a mismatch in the URL encoding, resulting in an assertion error. The expected URL is 'http://scrapytest.org/a%C3%A7%C3%A3o' but the actual URL is 'http://scrapytest.org/a%C3%83%C2%A7%C3%83%C2%A3o'.

The issue is related to the encoding of the special characters in the URL. The response's location header is 'a\xc3\xa7\xc3\xa3o', which needs to be properly decoded and encoded to form the redirected URL.

The fix involves correctly handling the encoding and decoding of the special characters in the URL.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = response.headers.get('location').decode('utf-8')  # Decode the location header using UTF-8
    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

In the corrected code:
1. The location header is decoded using UTF-8, which will correctly decode the special characters.
2. The decoded location is then used to form the redirected URL.
3. The remaining logic in the function remains the same.

By making these changes, the special characters in the URL will be encoded and decoded correctly, resolving the issue with URL encoding.
