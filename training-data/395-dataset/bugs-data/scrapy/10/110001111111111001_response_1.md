The test case `test_utf8_location` is expected to encode the location using UTF-8 and compare the result with the expected URL. The error message indicates that the encoding doesn't match with the expected value.

The potential error location within the `process_response` function is the encoding of the response location.

The bug occurs because the function is assuming the response location is in Latin1 encoding. However, it's actually encoded in UTF-8. This leads to the incorrect transformation of the characters, resulting in the mismatch between the expected and actual URLs.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the encoding of the location header in the response.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import urllib.parse

def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = response.headers.get(b'Location').decode('utf-8', 'ignore')  # decoding using utf-8

    redirected_url = urllib.parse.urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

With this correction, the response location is properly decoded using UTF-8, resulting in the correct transformation and ensuring that the test case `test_utf8_location` will pass successfully.
