The error message highlights an assertion failure within the `test_utf8_location` test function. The failure is related to the comparison between the expected encoded URL and the actual encoded URL in the `req_result`. The issue seems to be related to incorrect encoding and decoding of the URL.

Potential Error Location:
The issue is likely related to the conversion of the UTF-8 encoded location to the native string and then percent-encoded UTF-8.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug is occurring because the encoding and decoding operations are not being handled correctly, leading to an incorrect percent-encoded URL.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the UTF-8 encoded location is appropriately decoded to a native string before further processing.
2. Verify that the percent-encoding of the UTF-8 location is correctly performed to generate the expected result.

Corrected Code:

```python
class RedirectMiddleware(BaseRedirectMiddleware):
    """
    Handle redirection of requests based on response status and meta-refresh html tag
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
                response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
            return response

        allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307)
        if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
            return response

        location = response.headers.getlist('Location')[0].decode('utf-8')  # Decode UTF-8 location to native string

        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

        if response.status in (301, 307) or request.method == 'HEAD':
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

With the corrected code, the UTF-8 encoded location is appropriately decoded to a native string before further processing. This should ensure that the percent-encoded URL is generated correctly.
