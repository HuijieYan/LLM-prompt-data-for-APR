The test case 'test_utf8_location' is testing whether the 'Location' header in the response is properly handled and decoded. It seems that the issue is arising from a mismatch between the expected URL and the actual result after processing the response.

The potential error location in the 'process_response' function is the line where the 'location' is decoded and then joined with the request URL.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug might be due to improper handling or decoding of the 'location' header, resulting in an incorrectly encoded URL when joined with the request URL.

One approach to fixing the bug would be to ensure that the 'location' header is correctly decoded before it is used to join with the request URL. Additionally, ensuring that the encoding is consistent throughout the process will also be important.

Here's the corrected code for the 'process_response' function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin, unquote

class RedirectMiddleware(BaseRedirectMiddleware):
    """
    Handle redirection of requests based on response status and meta-refresh html tag
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
                response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
            return response
    
        allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307)
        if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
            return response
    
        # Decoding the 'location' header
        location = unquote(response.headers['location'])
    
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)
    
        if response.status in (301, 307) or request.method == 'HEAD':
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
    
        redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

The corrected code includes using the 'unquote' function to decode the 'location' header and then joining it with the request URL. This should ensure that the URL is correctly handled and encoded.
