The bug is likely caused by the incorrect decoding of the "Location" header using Latin-1 encoding. This can cause non-ASCII characters to be incorrectly decoded, leading to a wrong redirected URL.

To fix this bug, the decoding of the "Location" header should be done using the appropriate encoding, which should be UTF-8. This will ensure that non-ASCII characters in the URL are correctly decoded.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` function:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (
            request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)
    ):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    # Decode the "Location" header using UTF-8 encoding
    utf8_location = response.headers.get(b'Location').decode('utf-8')

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, utf8_location)

    if response.status in (301, 307) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

With this change, the "Location" header is decoded using UTF-8 encoding, ensuring that non-ASCII characters are correctly handled. This should fix the issue with incorrect decoding of the redirected URL.
