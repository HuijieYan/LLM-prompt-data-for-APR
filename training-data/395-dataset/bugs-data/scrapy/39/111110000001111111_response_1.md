The issue is occurring because the `make_requests_from_url` method is being deprecated. The `start_requests` method is trying to check if `make_requests_from_url` is the same as `Spider.make_requests_from_url` and if not, generates a warning and yields the requests. But the warning is unnecessary and the method `make_requests_from_url` should be used directly within the `start_requests` method.

To fix the bug, you can remove the check for deprecation and directly use the `make_requests_from_url` method.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class Spider(object_ref):
    """
    Base class for scrapy spiders. All spiders must inherit from this
    class.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def make_requests_from_url(self, url):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def start_requests(self):
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
```

With this approach, the unnecessary deprecation warning is removed and the `make_requests_from_url` method is used directly within the `start_requests` method.
