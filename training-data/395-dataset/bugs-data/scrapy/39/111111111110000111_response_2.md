The error is occurring in the `test_make_requests_from_url_deprecated` test function, specifically with the `self.assertEqual(len(w), 0)` assertion. This is because the `make_requests_from_url` method is not being overridden correctly and is issuing a warning even though the method is still working.

The issue is that the `start_requests` method in the `Spider` class is checking if the `make_requests_from_url` method is equal to `Spider.make_requests_from_url`, which is not the intended comparison.

To fix this bug, we need to compare the `make_requests_from_url` method against the parent class `Spider` to determine if it has been overridden. We can achieve this by using the `getattr` method to retrieve the unbound method from the class and compare it to the `Spider` class method.

Here's the corrected code for the `start_requests` method:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    if getattr(self.make_requests_from_url, '__func__', None) is not Spider.make_requests_from_url:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```

This change checks if the `make_requests_from_url` method has been overriden by comparing it to the unbound method of the `Spider` class. If it has been overridden, the warning is issued and the overridden method is called, otherwise the default behavior is applied.
