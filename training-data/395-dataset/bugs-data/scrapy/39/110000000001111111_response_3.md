The problem is that the method `start_requests()` is trying to compare if `self.make_requests_from_url` is not equal to `Spider.make_requests_from_url`, which doesn't really make sense in this context. The intention seems to be to check if the `make_requests_from_url` method has been overridden in the spider.

The reason for the bug is that the comparison `self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url` is likely not the correct way to check if the method has been overridden.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the `make_requests_from_url` method has been overridden by the spider class. If it has been overridden, we yield the requests based on the overridden method, otherwise, we yield the requests by instantiating the `Request` class.

Here's the corrected code for the `start_requests()` method:

```python
import warnings
from scrapy.http import Request

def start_requests(self):
    if getattr(self, 'make_requests_from_url', None) is not getattr(Spider, 'make_requests_from_url', None):
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```

In this corrected method, we use the `getattr` function to check if the `make_requests_from_url` method has been overridden in the spider's class, and yield requests accordingly.
