The error occurs when the function `start_requests` is called, specifically when it checks whether `make_requests_from_url` is not equal to `Spider.make_requests_from_url`. If they are not equal, it raises a deprecation warning and then attempts to yield requests from the start urls using `make_requests_from_url`, otherwise it yields a Request object.

The issue seems to be related to the deprecation of the `make_requests_from_url` method, and the intention is to remove it in future Scrapy releases.

To fix the issue, we need to update the `start_requests` method to remove the usage of `make_requests_from_url` and change it to use `Request` directly.

Here's the corrected code for the `start_requests` method:
```python
def start_requests(self):
    if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
    
    for url in self.start_urls:
        yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```

With this correction, the deprecation warning will still be raised if `make_requests_from_url` is not equal to `Spider.make_requests_from_url`, but in both cases, the `start_requests` method will yield a Request object for each url in the `start_urls` list.
