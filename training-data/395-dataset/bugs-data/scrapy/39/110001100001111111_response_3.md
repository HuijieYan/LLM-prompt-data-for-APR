The buggy function `start_requests` is checking if `self.make_requests_from_url` is not equal to `Spider.make_requests_from_url`. If they are not equal, a warning is raised and `make_requests_from_url` is called for each URL in `start_urls`. Otherwise, a `Request` object is created for each URL in `start_urls`.

The bug occurs because the check `if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url` is comparing the method `make_requests_from_url` of the spider object with the method `make_requests_from_url` of the `Spider` class, which will always be True. Instead, it should check if the method of the spider object is not equal to the original `make_requests_from_url` method.

The fix for this issue is to compare the method of the spider object with the original method by using `!=` operator. If they are not the same, it means the spider's method is overridden, and the deprecation warning should be issued.

Here's the corrected code for the `start_requests` function:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    if self.make_requests_from_url != Spider.make_requests_from_url:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```

With this fix, the function will correctly check if the `make_requests_from_url` method of the spider object is overridden, and issue the deprecation warning if necessary.
