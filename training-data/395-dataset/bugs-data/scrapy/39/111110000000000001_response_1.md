Potential error location: The if statement `if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url` is likely causing the bug.

Reasons behind the bug: The condition `self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url` is checking if the method `self.make_requests_from_url` is not the same as `Spider.make_requests_from_url`, which is probably not the intended comparison. It seems like the intended behavior is to check if `self.make_requests_from_url` is not overridden in the current class.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: The bug can be fixed by using the `getattr` function to check if the method is overridden in the current class.

Corrected code:
```python
class Spider(object_ref):
    """
    Base class for scrapy spiders. All spiders must inherit from this
    class.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def make_requests_from_url(self, url):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass



    # corrected function
    def start_requests(self):
        if getattr(self, 'make_requests_from_url', None) is not Spider.make_requests_from_url:
            warnings.warn(
                "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
                "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
                "Please override start_requests method instead."
            )
            for url in self.start_urls:
                yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
        else:
            for url in self.start_urls:
                yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```
