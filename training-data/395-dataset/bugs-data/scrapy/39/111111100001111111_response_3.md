The bug occurs in the `start_requests` method of the Spider class. The method checks if the `make_requests_from_url` function is equal to `Spider.make_requests_from_url` and issues a warning if they are not equal. It then yields requests based on the comparison, which is incorrect behavior.

The reason for the bug is that the comparison `self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url` is not the correct way to check if `make_requests_from_url` has been overridden in the subclass. This comparison checks for object identity, not function override.

To fix the bug, you should use the `inspect` module to check if the method has been overridden in the subclass. You can use the `inspect.getmro` function to get the method resolution order and then compare the function in the current class with the function in `Spider` class.

Here's the corrected code for the `start_requests` method:

```python
import warnings
import inspect

class Spider(object_ref):
    """
    Base class for scrapy spiders. All spiders must inherit from this
    class.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...
    
    def start_requests(self):
        mro = inspect.getmro(self.__class__)
        if self.make_requests_from_url is not mro[0].make_requests_from_url:
            warnings.warn(
                "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
                "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
                "Please override start_requests method instead."
            )
            for url in self.start_urls:
                yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
        else:
            for url in self.start_urls:
                yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```

This code uses `inspect.getmro` to get the method resolution order and compares the `make_requests_from_url` method in the current class with the one in `Spider` class. If they are not the same, it issues a warning and yields requests based on the overridden method.
