The problem occurs in the `start_requests` method of the `Spider` class. The `make_requests_from_url` method checks if it is the same as the one defined in the `Spider` class. If it's not the same, it issues a deprecation warning and yields requests using the `make_requests_from_url` method. Otherwise, it yields requests directly using the `Request` class.

The error message indicates that the number of warnings recorded is not as expected.

The potential error location is in the comparison `if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url`. This comparison is incorrect and should be comparing the actual methods, not their references.

The bug occurs because the comparison `self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url` is comparing the references to the methods, not the actual methods themselves. This means that even if the `make_requests_from_url` method is overridden in a subclass, the comparison will still be `False` because the references are different.

One approach for fixing the bug is to compare the method names as strings instead of their references. Another approach is to use the `__func__` attribute to compare the original unbound methods.

Here's the corrected code for the `start_requests` method:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    if self.make_requests_from_url.__func__ is not Spider.make_requests_from_url.__func__:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```
