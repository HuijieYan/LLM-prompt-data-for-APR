Potential Error Location:
The potential error is in the 'start_requests' method, specifically in the conditional check `if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url`.

Reasons for the Bug:
The condition `self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url` is comparing two function objects, which may not work as expected. Instead, it should compare the actual methods to check for equality.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we can compare the bound method `self.make_requests_from_url` with the unbound method `Spider.make_requests_from_url` using the `!=` operator. This will properly compare the method objects and determine if they are not the same.

Corrected Code:
```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class Spider(object_ref):
    """
    Base class for scrapy spiders. All spiders must inherit from this
    class.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def make_requests_from_url(self, url):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass



    # corrected function
    def start_requests(self):
        if self.make_requests_from_url != Spider.make_requests_from_url:
            warnings.warn(
                "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
                "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
                "Please override start_requests method instead."
            )
            for url in self.start_urls:
                yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
        else:
            for url in self.start_urls:
                yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
