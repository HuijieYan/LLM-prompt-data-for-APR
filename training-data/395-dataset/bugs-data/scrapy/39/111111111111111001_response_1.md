The error occurs due to the incorrect comparison of the `make_requests_from_url` method with `Spider.make_requests_from_url`. This comparison is causing the warning message to be wrongly issued. The comparison `if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url` should be changed to `if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url.__func__`.

Also, the `yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)` line should be updated to `yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url.__func__:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
```
