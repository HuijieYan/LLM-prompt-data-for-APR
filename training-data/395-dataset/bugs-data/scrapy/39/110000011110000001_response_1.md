The test case is testing the behavior of the `start_requests` method in the Spider class. It creates two sub-classes of Spider (`MySpider4` and `MySpider5`), each with its own `start_urls` attribute. `MySpider5` also overrides the `make_requests_from_url` method. The test then checks whether warnings are issued when `start_requests` is called on these classes and whether the requests are made correctly.

The error occurs in the assertion `self.assertEqual(len(w), 0)`, indicating that the number of warnings recorded (`len(w)`) is not equal to 0, which is unexpected.

The issue in the code is that the comparison `if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url` is incorrect. This code checks if the `make_requests_from_url` method on the instance is not the same object as the `make_requests_from_url` method on the Spider class. This is not the intended behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison to check whether the `make_requests_from_url` method has been overridden in the sub-class.

Here's the corrected code for the `start_requests` method:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    if getattr(self.make_requests_from_url, '__func__', None) is not getattr(Spider.make_requests_from_url, '__func__', None):
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```

In the corrected code, we use `getattr()` to check the underlying function of the `make_requests_from_url` method and compare it to the underlying function of the method in the Spider class. This correctly checks if the method has been overridden in the sub-class and resolves the issue in the original code.
