The error in the provided code is in the start_requests method. The error occurs because the make_requests_from_url method is being compared using the "is" operator instead of comparing the method itself. This comparison will always result in false since "self.make_requests_from_url" and "Spider.make_requests_from_url" point to the same method. 

To fix this bug, we should use the "==" operator to compare the methods instead of using "is" operator.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    if self.make_requests_from_url != Spider.make_requests_from_url:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```
