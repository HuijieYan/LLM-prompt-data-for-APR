The buggy function `start_requests` checks if `self.make_requests_from_url` is not `Spider.make_requests_from_url`, and if true, it yields `self.make_requests_from_url(url)` for each `url` in `self.start_urls`. Otherwise, it yields `Request(url, dont_filter=True)` for each `url` in `self.start_urls`.

Based on the input and expected output provided, the goal of the `start_requests` function is to yield the request using `self.make_requests_from_url(url)` if it's overridden in the spider class. Otherwise, it should yield a basic Request object.

Following are the identified issues and possible approaches for fixing the bug:

1. The code checks for `self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url`, but this is incorrect because `self.make_requests_from_url` is most likely a method and should not be compared to `Spider.make_requests_from_url`.
   - Approach: Use `getattr` to dynamically get the method from the spider class and compare it with `self.make_requests_from_url`.

2. The `make_requests_from_url` method is expected to be overridden in the spider class, but the comparison is incorrect, and the code doesn't handle the case where `make_requests_from_url` has not been overridden.
   - Approach: Check if the method is overridden using `getattr` and then yield the appropriate request.

Based on the identified issues and possible approaches, here's the corrected code for the `start_requests` function:

```python
import warnings
from scrapy import Request

def start_requests(self):
    make_requests_from_url = getattr(self, 'make_requests_from_url', None)
    if make_requests_from_url and make_requests_from_url.__func__ != Spider.make_requests_from_url:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```

In the corrected code, `getattr` is used to dynamically get the `make_requests_from_url` method from the spider class, and properly compare it with `Spider.make_requests_from_url`. Then, based on the existence of the overridden method, the appropriate request is yielded.
