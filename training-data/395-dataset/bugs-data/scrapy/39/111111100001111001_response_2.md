The bug is likely occurring in the start_requests method of the Spider class. The error message suggests that the make_requests_from_url method is deprecated and won't be called in future Scrapy releases.

The buggy part of the function is the if condition:
```python
if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url:
```

It seems that the intention of this condition is to check if the make_requests_from_url method has been overridden in a subclass. However, the comparison `self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url` is incorrect and won't achieve this goal. The correct approach would be to compare the bound method of the current instance with the unbound method of the Spider class.

To fix this bug, we can modify the comparison to use the unbound method of the Spider class and check if it's different from the make_requests_from_url method of the current instance.

Here's the fixed code for the start_requests method:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    if getattr(self.make_requests_from_url, '__func__', None) is not Spider.make_requests_from_url:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```
This fix checks if the __func__ attribute of the make_requests_from_url function is not the same as the make_requests_from_url function in the Spider class. This will correctly identify whether the method has been overridden in a subclass.

With this change, the start_requests method should work correctly and the deprecation warning will be triggered when necessary.
