The error occurs in the `start_requests` method of the Spider class. The `start_requests` method is responsible for generating the initial Requests for the spider to start crawling.

The method is checking if `self.make_requests_from_url` is not equal to `Spider.make_requests_from_url` and if this condition is True then a warning is issued since `Spider.make_requests_from_url` is deprecated, and requests are yielded using `self.make_requests_from_url(url)`. If the condition is False, then the requests are yielded using `Request(url, dont_filter=True)`.

The issue seems to be occurring because of the incorrect comparison `self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url`. Instead, it should check if `self.make_requests_from_url` is not equal to `Spider.make_requests_from_url`. Additionally, there could be a missing import statement for the `warnings` module.

To fix the bug, the `start_requests` method should be updated as follows:


```python
# Corrected start_requests method
import warnings

def start_requests(self):
    if self.make_requests_from_url != Spider.make_requests_from_url:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```

The corrected method includes the import statement for the `warnings` module and fixes the comparison condition to `self.make_requests_from_url != Spider.make_requests_from_url`. This will ensure that the deprecated warning is issued correctly, and the correct requests are yielded based on the comparison result.
