The test case "test_make_requests_from_url_deprecated" is trying to test the behavior of the "start_requests" method in the Spider class. It creates two subclasses of Spider, MySpider4, and MySpider5, and checks if warnings are issued when the "make_requests_from_url" method is overridden.

The error message indicates that the assertion "self.assertEqual(len(w), 0)" is failing, meaning that a warning is being issued even though it shouldn't be.

The issue in the provided "start_requests" function is that the condition "if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url" is incorrect. This condition will always be True because it checks if the bound method is not equal to an unbound method, which it never will be.

To fix the bug, the condition should check if the "make_requests_from_url" method is overridden in the current class.

Here's the corrected code for the "start_requests" method:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    if self.make_requests_from_url.__func__ is not Spider.make_requests_from_url:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```

In the corrected code, the condition "if self.make_requests_from_url.__func__ is not Spider.make_requests_from_url" checks if the "make_requests_from_url" method is overridden in the current class, instead of comparing the bound and unbound methods. This will address the bug and the test case should pass without issuing unnecessary warnings.
