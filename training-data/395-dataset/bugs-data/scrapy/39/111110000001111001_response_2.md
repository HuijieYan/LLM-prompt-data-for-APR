It appears that the buggy function is meant to handle deprecation warnings for the `make_requests_from_url` method and suggests using the `start_requests` method instead.

The bug occurs because the comparison `self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url` is trying to compare a method bound to `self` to an unbound method on the class `Spider`. This comparison will always be true, as they are referencing different objects.

To fix the bug, we can simply check if the `make_requests_from_url` method is defined directly on the class of `self` using the `getattr` function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class Spider(object_ref):
    """
    Base class for scrapy spiders. All spiders must inherit from this
    class.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def make_requests_from_url(self, url):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass



    # this is the corrected function
    def start_requests(self):
        if getattr(self.make_requests_from_url, '__func__', None) is not Spider.make_requests_from_url:
            warnings.warn(
                "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
                "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
                "Please override start_requests method instead."
            )
            for url in self.start_urls:
                yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
        else:
            for url in self.start_urls:
                yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```

This way, we are comparing the `__func__` attribute of `self.make_requests_from_url` with the unbound method `Spider.make_requests_from_url`, which accurately determines if the method has been overridden.
