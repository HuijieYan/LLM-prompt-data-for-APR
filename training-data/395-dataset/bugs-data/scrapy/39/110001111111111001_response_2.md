The error occurs when the test function `test_make_requests_from_url_deprecated` tries to assert that the number of issued warnings is 0, but it is actually 1. This is due to the incorrect behavior of the `start_requests` method in issuing warnings.

The issue in the `start_requests` method is that it checks if `self.make_requests_from_url` is not `Spider.make_requests_from_url`, which is always True as `self.make_requests_from_url` is bound to the instance method, causing the warning to be issued every time `start_requests` is called.

The fix for this issue is to remove the condition checking for `self.make_requests_from_url` and directly use the overridden `make_requests_from_url` method when generating requests.

Here's the corrected code for the `start_requests` method:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    for url in self.start_urls:
        yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
```

With this change, the warnings will not be issued unnecessarily and the test should pass without any errors.
