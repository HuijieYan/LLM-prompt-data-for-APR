Potential Error Location:
The error is occurring in the start_requests method within the Spider class. The method is checking if the make_requests_from_url method is different from Spider.make_requests_from_url, which seems to be an incorrect approach for determining if the method has been overridden.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The code is comparing method references using the 'is' keyword, which checks for object identity. This is not the correct way to check if a method has been overridden by a subclass. Additionally, the function is deprecated and is not providing the intended functionality.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use the inspect module to check if the make_requests_from_url method has been overridden by a subclass.
2. Remove the deprecated method and update the documentation accordingly.
3. Update the code to use a different approach for achieving the desired functionality.

Corrected Code:

```python
class Spider(object):
    """
    Base class for scrapy spiders. All spiders must inherit from this
    class.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the updated function
    def start_requests(self):
        if self.make_requests_from_url.__func__ is not Spider.make_requests_from_url.__func__:
            warnings.warn(
                "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
                "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
                "Please override start_requests method instead."
            )
            for url in self.start_urls:
                yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
        else:
            for url in self.start_urls:
                yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
