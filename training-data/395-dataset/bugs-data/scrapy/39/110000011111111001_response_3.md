The error message indicates that the number of warnings is not as expected, as the test is expecting 0 warnings but receiving 1. This error occurs because the `start_requests` method in the provided function checks if the `make_requests_from_url` method is equal to `Spider.make_requests_from_url`, but it should be checking if it is not equal to `Spider.make_requests_from_url`.

To fix this, the if condition in the `start_requests` method needs to be modified to check if `self.make_requests_from_url` is not equal to `Spider.make_requests_from_url`.

Here's the corrected code for the `start_requests` method:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    if self.make_requests_from_url != Spider.make_requests_from_url:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```

By making this change, the `start_requests` method will correctly issue a warning when the `make_requests_from_url` method is not overridden and will use the `make_requests_from_url` method when it is overridden.
