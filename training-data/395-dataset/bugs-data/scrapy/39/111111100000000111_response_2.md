The bug is in the start_requests method of the Spider class. The code first checks if the make_requests_from_url method is not equal to Spider.make_requests_from_url, and if it is not equal, it issues a warning and yields the requests made by make_requests_from_url. If it is equal, it yields requests using Request class.

The bug occurs because make_requests_from_url is never equal to Spider.make_requests_from_url, and thus, the warning is always issued and the requests are always yielded using make_requests_from_url, which is not the intended behavior. 

To fix the bug, we can change the condition to check if make_requests_from_url is equal to the instance's own method, and if not, issue the warning and yield requests using Request class.

Here's the corrected code for the start_requests method:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider().make_requests_from_url:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```

By ensuring that we compare the instance's make_requests_from_url to the Spider's make_requests_from_url, we can fix the bug and have the method behave as intended.
