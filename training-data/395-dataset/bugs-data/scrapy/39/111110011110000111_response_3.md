The error occurs in the `test_make_requests_from_url_deprecated` test function. The `self.assertEqual(len(w), 0)` assertion is failing, indicating that the number of warnings recorded is not as expected. This is likely due to the buggy `start_requests` method in the `Spider` class.

The bug occurs because the comparison `self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url` is incorrect. The intention here seems to be to compare the `make_requests_from_url` method of the current instance with the base class method, but the comparison is not being executed correctly.

To fix this, we can use the `getattr` function to compare the methods. We can also remove the if-else condition as it's not needed. 

Here's the corrected code for the `start_requests` method:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    make_requests_from_url = getattr(self, 'make_requests_from_url', None)
    
    if make_requests_from_url and make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```

With these changes, the comparison of the `make_requests_from_url` method should work correctly, and the deprecation warning should be issued when calling `start_requests`.

The suggested GitHub issue title "deprecate Spider.make_requests_from_url" and its associated description align with the proposed changes for deprecating and fixing the `make_requests_from_url` method.
