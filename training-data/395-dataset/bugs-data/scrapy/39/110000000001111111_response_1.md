Issue:
The bug occurs when the start_requests method in the provided class is called. The error message suggests that the Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated and will not be called in future releases, and the start_requests method should be overridden instead.

Reason for the bug:
The bug occurs because the start_requests method is not properly handling the deprecation of the Spider.make_requests_from_url method. The code within the start_requests method is not following the deprecation warning and is still using Spider.make_requests_from_url.

Approach to fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the start_requests method should be updated to override the deprecated Spider.make_requests_from_url method as per the deprecation warning. The start_requests method should handle the requests directly and not rely on the deprecated Spider.make_requests_from_url method.

Corrected code for the start_requests method:
```python
def start_requests(self):
    for url in self.start_urls:
        yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```
