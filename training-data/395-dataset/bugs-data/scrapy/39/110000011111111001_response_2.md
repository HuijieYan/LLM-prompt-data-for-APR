The error occurs when the test function `test_make_requests_from_url_deprecated` tries to assert the equality of the number of warnings raised during the test with the expected value.

The buggy function `start_requests` seems to have an incorrect condition for checking `self.make_requests_from_url`. It is comparing it to `Spider.make_requests_from_url` which may not yield the expected behavior.

To fix the bug, we can change the condition to compare if `self.make_requests_from_url` is overridden, and if not, issue a warning. Then, regardless of the warning, the respective method should be called with the appropriate URL.

Here's the corrected code for the `start_requests` function:

```python
import warnings

def start_requests(self):
    if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url) if self.make_requests_from_url else Request(url, dont_filter=True)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```

With this correction, the function will first check if the `self.make_requests_from_url` is overridden. If it is overridden, it will call that method with the URL, otherwise, it will proceed with the default behavior and issue a warning.
