The error occurs because the condition `if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url:` does not check if the function has been overridden by a subclass. As a result, it always triggers the deprecation warning even if the function has been overridden.

To fix this, we should check if `self.make_requests_from_url` is the same as the base class `Spider`'s `make_requests_from_url` method using the `is` operator. If they are the same, we yield a `Request` object, and if they are different, we yield the result of `self.make_requests_from_url(url)`.

Here's the corrected code for the `start_requests` method:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```
