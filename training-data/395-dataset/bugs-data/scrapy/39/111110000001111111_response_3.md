Potential error location:
The error seems to be occurring in the start_requests method of the Spider class. The conditional check for self.make_requests_from_url is not as expected.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the conditional check in the start_requests method is incorrectly comparing the make_requests_from_url method against Spider.make_requests_from_url. This check is attempting to deprecate the make_requests_from_url method, but it is not handling the comparison correctly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
The conditional check should be modified to compare the method against the class itself, rather than just the method. This will ensure that the correct method is being checked for deprecation.

Here's the corrected code for the start_requests method of the Spider class:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    if self.make_requests_from_url is not self.__class__.make_requests_from_url:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```
