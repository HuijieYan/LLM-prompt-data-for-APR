The error occurs in the `start_requests` method. The bug is caused by using `self.make_requests_from_url` without the parentheses to actually call the method. Since this comparison will always be true, the code inside the if statement will never be executed.

To fix this bug, we need to actually call the `make_requests_from_url` method by adding parentheses after `self.make_requests_from_url` and passing the `url` as an argument.

Here's the corrected code for the `start_requests` method:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    if self.make_requests_from_url() is not Spider.make_requests_from_url():
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```
