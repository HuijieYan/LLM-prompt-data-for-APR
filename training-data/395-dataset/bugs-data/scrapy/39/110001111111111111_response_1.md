The error in the function `start_requests` is due to the comparison `if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url:`. This comparison is checking if the method `make_requests_from_url` is not equal to `Spider.make_requests_from_url`. However, the intended comparison is to check if the method has been overridden in the spider class.

The reason for the bug is that the comparison is not correctly checking if the `make_requests_from_url` method has been overridden in the spider class. Instead, it is comparing the method itself with the method from the `Spider` class, which will always return `True` because they are different instances.

To fix the bug, we can use the `getattr` function to check if the method in the current instance is the same as the method in the `Spider` class. If it's the same, we issue a deprecation warning, and if it's overridden, we use the overridden method to create requests.

Here's the corrected code for the `start_requests` method:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    make_requests_from_url = getattr(self, 'make_requests_from_url', None)
    if make_requests_from_url is Spider.make_requests_from_url:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```

With this fix, the comparison checks if the `make_requests_from_url` method has been overridden in the spider class and issues a warning if it hasn't. If it's overridden, the overridden method is used to create requests.

This should resolve the issue and make the function work as expected.
