Potential Error: The start_requests function is trying to check if make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url and if so, it yields requests from the make_requests_from_url method. If it is Spider.make_requests_from_url, then it yields requests using the Request class directly.

Reason for the Bug: The function is trying to compare if the make_requests_from_url method is not equal to Spider.make_requests_from_url, but it's not comparing correctly and is not yielding requests appropriately.

Approach to Fix the Bug: We need to check if the make_requests_from_url method is overridden by the spider and yield requests accordingly. We can use the isinstance() method to check if the method is overridden.

Corrected Code:
```python
from scrapy import Request, Spider
import warnings

class YourSpider(Spider):

    # assuming make_requests_from_url is overridden in the spider
    def make_requests_from_url(self, url):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def start_requests(self):
        if not isinstance(self.make_requests_from_url, Spider.make_requests_from_url):
            warnings.warn(
                "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
                "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
                "Please override start_requests method instead."
            )
            for url in self.start_urls:
                yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
        else:
            for url in self.start_urls:
                yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```
