Potential error location: The if condition `if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url` is comparing the method to the class instead of the function itself.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurred because the comparison `self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url` is comparing the function reference with the class reference instead of comparing the function references. This will always evaluate to True since they are different references.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Change the comparison to `if self.make_requests_from_url.__func__ is not Spider.make_requests_from_url.__func__` to compare the underlying functions.
2. Use the `staticmethod` decorator for the `make_requests_from_url` method to access it directly from the class.

Corrected code:
```python
    def start_requests(self):
        if self.make_requests_from_url.__func__ is not Spider.make_requests_from_url.__func__:
            warnings.warn(
                "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
                "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
                "Please override start_requests method instead."
            )
            for url in self.start_urls:
                yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
        else:
            for url in self.start_urls:
                yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```
