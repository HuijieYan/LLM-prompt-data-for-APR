# Corrected function/method
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_39/scrapy/spiders/__init__.py

from scrapy import Request

# relative function's signature in this file
def make_requests_from_url(self, url):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass


# this is the corrected function
def start_requests(self):
    for url in self.start_urls:
        yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
