The bug in the provided code is due to the incorrect use of the `make_requests_from_url` method and the comparison with `Spider.make_requests_from_url`. This comparison is not valid in this context.

The `make_requests_from_url` method is being compared with `Spider.make_requests_from_url`, which is leading to the warning message being issued. However, the code should not be comparing these two methods.

To fix the bug:
1. Remove the comparison between `make_requests_from_url` and `Spider.make_requests_from_url`.
2. Instead of using `make_requests_from_url`, we should directly yield a `Request` object within the `start_requests` method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    for url in self.start_urls:
        yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```

By directly yielding a `Request` object within the `start_requests` method, we can avoid the comparison issue and the warning message related to the `make_requests_from_url` method.
