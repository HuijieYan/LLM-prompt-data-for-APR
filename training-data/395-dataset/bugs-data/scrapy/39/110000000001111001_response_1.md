The issue with the provided function is that the comparison `self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url` is not appropriate. This comparison does not verify if the `make_requests_from_url` method is overridden in the current spider class or not.

Instead of the incorrect comparison, the intention is to check if the `make_requests_from_url` method has been overridden in the current spider class. If it has been overridden, a warning should be issued, and if not, the original method should be called.

To fix this, we will modify the comparison to check if the method is overridden in the current class or not. We can use the `__func__` attribute of the method to check if it's the same as the original method in the `Spider` class.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import warnings
from scrapy.http import Request
from scrapy.spiders import Spider

def start_requests(self):
    if self.make_requests_from_url.__func__ is not Spider.make_requests_from_url:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```

This corrected function compares the `__func__` attribute of the `make_requests_from_url` method in the current class with the `make_requests_from_url` method of the `Spider` class. This will correctly determine if the method has been overridden or not. If overridden, it will issue a warning, and if not, it will call the original method.
