The error occurs in the `start_requests` method of the Spider class. The method is checking if `self.make_requests_from_url` is not `Spider.make_requests_from_url`, and if so, it raises a deprecation warning and yields requests from `make_requests_from_url(url)`. Otherwise, it just yields a regular `Request` object.

The bug occurs because `self.make_requests_from_url` is not being used correctly. It should be attempting to call the `make_requests_from_url` method defined in the Spider class, but instead, it's comparing it to the `Spider.make_requests_from_url` method itself. This comparison is causing the deprecation warning to be raised prematurely and it's not yielding the correct results.

To fix the bug, we should directly call the `make_requests_from_url` method on the instance `self` rather than comparing it to the class method `Spider.make_requests_from_url`.

Here's the corrected code for the `start_requests` method:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    if getattr(self.make_requests_from_url, '__func__', None) is not getattr(Spider.make_requests_from_url, '__func__', None):
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```
