1. The test case is trying to test the `make_requests_from_url` method of the Spider class. It creates two instances of the Spider class, `MySpider4` and `MySpider5`, and checks if the warning is generated when the `make_requests_from_url` method is overridden and if the method still works as expected.

2. The error seems to be occurring in the assertion where it is checking the length of the warning list (`self.assertEqual(len(w), 0)`).

3. The bug is likely occurring because the `make_requests_from_url` method is not being overridden correctly, and the warning is not being generated as expected.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `make_requests_from_url` method is properly overridden in the Spider class and that the warning is generated when it is called.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `start_requests` method:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead.",
            DeprecationWarning  # Added DeprecationWarning
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```

By adding `DeprecationWarning` in the `warnings.warn` call, we ensure that the correct warning is generated when the `make_requests_from_url` method is called. This should fix the bug and allow the test case to pass successfully.
