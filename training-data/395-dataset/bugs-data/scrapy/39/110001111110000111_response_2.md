The error occurs at `self.assertEqual(len(w), 0)` in the test function `test_make_requests_from_url_deprecated`. The error message indicates that the `len(w)` is expected to be 0, but it is 1 instead. This mismatch indicates that the warning is not being handled correctly in the `start_requests` function.

The bug occurs because the comparison `self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url` is incorrect. This condition is used to check if `make_requests_from_url` method in the spider is overridden or not. Instead, we should check if the method is overriden by comparing if the method is directly defined within the spider class.

To fix the bug, the condition should be changed to `if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url and self.make_requests_from_url.__func__ is not getattr(Spider.make_requests_from_url, '__func__'):`. This will correctly check if the `make_requests_from_url` method has been overridden in the spider class.

The corrected function `start_requests` is provided below:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url and self.make_requests_from_url.__func__ is not getattr(Spider.make_requests_from_url, '__func__'):
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```
