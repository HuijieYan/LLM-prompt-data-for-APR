The bug occurs because the conditional check `if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url` is trying to compare two different `make_requests_from_url` functions, but the intention behind this code is to check if the class method `make_requests_from_url` has been overridden by the user in their Spider subclass. Therefore, the code is not correctly checking for the intended condition.

To fix this bug, we need to compare the actual method in the instance with the one in the base class using the `getattr` function.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    if getattr(self.make_requests_from_url, '__func__', None) is not Spider.make_requests_from_url:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```

With this correction, we are now correctly comparing the overridden method with the base class method, taking into account methods that are wrappers or bound methods (which was causing the comparison to fail previously).
