The error in the provided function is that the `make_requests_from_url` method is being called directly from the class instance instead of being accessed through the class itself. This causes a warning to be issued and suggests that the method will be deprecated in future Scrapy releases.

To fix this issue, the correct approach is to access the `make_requests_from_url` method through the class itself instead of the instance.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```

By accessing the `make_requests_from_url` method through the class itself (i.e., `Spider.make_requests_from_url`), the warning will no longer be issued and the code will work as intended.
