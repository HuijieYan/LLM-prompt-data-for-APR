The issue arises from the comparison `self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url` in the `start_requests` method. This comparison is likely leading to the deprecation warning being triggered erroneously. The comparison should be made on the method itself rather than comparing the method to its parent class.

To fix the bug, the `start_requests` method needs to be modified to compare the reference to the method `make_requests_from_url` directly with the reference to the method from the Spider class. This can be achieved using the `getattr` method to retrieve the method dynamically, and then compare the references.

Here's the corrected code for the `start_requests` method:

```python
import warnings
from scrapy import Request

def start_requests(self):
    if getattr(self.make_requests_from_url, '__func__', None) is not getattr(Spider.make_requests_from_url, '__func__', None):
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```

With this correction, the comparison is made on the references to the methods, ensuring that the deprecation warning is triggered only when necessary.
