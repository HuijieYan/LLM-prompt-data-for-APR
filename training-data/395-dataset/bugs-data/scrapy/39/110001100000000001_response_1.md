1. The problematic function 'start_requests' is supposed to generate initial requests for the spider to start crawling. The function checks if 'make_requests_from_url' is not equal to 'Spider.make_requests_from_url' and if so, it yields requests for each URL in 'start_urls' using 'make_requests_from_url'. Otherwise, it yields requests using the 'Request' class.

2. The potential error location within the function is the conditional check 'if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url'.

3. The error is occurring because 'make_requests_from_url' is being checked against 'Spider.make_requests_from_url' as if they are both methods of the same class, which they are not.

4. To fix the bug, we can explicitly check if 'make_requests_from_url' is not equal to the 'make_requests_from_url' method of the spider class, instead of comparing it with 'Spider.make_requests_from_url'. This will ensure that we are checking for the specific method overridden by the spider class.

5. Here's the corrected code for the 'start_requests' function:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    if self.make_requests_from_url != Spider.make_requests_from_url:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```
