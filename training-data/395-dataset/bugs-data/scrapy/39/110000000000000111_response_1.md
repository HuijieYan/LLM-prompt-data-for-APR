The issue here is that the `start_requests` method is using a deprecated method `make_requests_from_url` which is no longer supported in future Scrapy releases. Instead, the method should be overridden by the `start_requests` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `start_requests` method:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    for url in self.start_urls:
        yield scrapy.Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```

In the corrected code, we are directly yielding `scrapy.Request` objects for each URL in `start_urls` without using the deprecated `make_requests_from_url` method. This approach simplifies the code and aligns with the recommended practice for future Scrapy releases.
