Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the provided function is in the conditional statement checking the equality of `self.make_requests_from_url` and `Spider.make_requests_from_url`. This comparison should be checking if `self.make_requests_from_url` is not equal to `Spider.make_requests_from_url` instead.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the conditional statement is checking for equality, but the intended logic is to check for inequality. This leads to the incorrect execution flow within the function.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional statement to check for inequality and adjust the execution flow accordingly.

Corrected Code:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    if self.make_requests_from_url != Spider.make_requests_from_url:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```
