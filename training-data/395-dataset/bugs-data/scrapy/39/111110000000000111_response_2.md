The issue with the `start_requests` method is that it is checking if `self.make_requests_from_url` is the same function as `Spider.make_requests_from_url` using the `is` keyword, which is checking for object identity. This comparison is not what the developer intended and is causing the `DeprecationWarning` to be issued incorrectly.

The intention seems to be checking if the `make_requests_from_url` method has been overridden in the current spider class. Instead of checking for object identity, the method should be using `!=` comparison to check if the `make_requests_from_url` method in the current class is different from the one in the `Spider` class.

To fix the issue, the comparison in the `start_requests` method should be changed to compare the methods using the `!=` operator.

Here is the corrected `start_requests` method:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    if self.make_requests_from_url != Spider.make_requests_from_url:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```
