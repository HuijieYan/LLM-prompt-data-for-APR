The error message indicates that the "Spider.make_requests_from_url" method is deprecated and should no longer be used. Instead, the "start_requests" method should be overridden.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the "if" condition where it checks if "self.make_requests_from_url" is not equal to "Spider.make_requests_from_url".

The bug occurs because the function is incorrectly checking the equality of "self.make_requests_from_url" with "Spider.make_requests_from_url" instead of checking if "self.make_requests_from_url" is not the same as the current class's "make_requests_from_url".

To fix the bug, we should compare "self.make_requests_from_url" with the current class's "make_requests_from_url" and use the "start_requests" method instead of the deprecated "Spider.make_requests_from_url" method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    if self.make_requests_from_url is not self.__class__.make_requests_from_url:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```
