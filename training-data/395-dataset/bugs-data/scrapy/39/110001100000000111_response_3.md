Potential Error Location: The issue lies in the start_requests method, specifically in the conditional check `if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url`.

Reasons behind the Bug: The conditional check is trying to compare the method `make_requests_from_url` with `Spider.make_requests_from_url`, which is not a valid comparison. It seems like the intention was to check if the `make_requests_from_url` method was overridden in the current spider class.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Instead of comparing the methods directly, we can use the `getattr` function to check if the method is overridden in the current class.
2. We can handle the deprecation warning and recommend users to override the `start_requests` method instead of using `make_requests_from_url`.

Corrected Code:
```python
import warnings
from scrapy import Request

# Relative function's signature in this file
def make_requests_from_url(self, url):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass


# Corrected function
def start_requests(self):
    if self.make_requests_from_url != Spider.make_requests_from_url:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead.",
            DeprecationWarning
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
