The issue in the code is that the `make_requests_from_url` method is being compared with `Spider.make_requests_from_url` using the equality operator, which will result in `False` because the methods are different objects in memory, even though they might do the same thing.

To fix this issue, we can directly check if the `make_requests_from_url` method of the current class is equal to the `Spider.make_requests_from_url` method. If it is not, then a warning is issued, and requests are made using the overridden `make_requests_from_url` method. Otherwise, requests are made using the default `Request` with `dont_filter=True`.

Here's the corrected code for the `start_requests` method:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    if self.make_requests_from_url != Spider.make_requests_from_url:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```
