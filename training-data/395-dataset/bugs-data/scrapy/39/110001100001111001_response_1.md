The problem originates from the comparison `self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url`.

The comparison `self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url` is incorrect because it checks if the two methods are different objects, not if they are different functions with the same name. This causes the warning message to be displayed when it shouldn't be.

To fix this, we need to compare the functions by name rather than by object identity.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import warnings
from scrapy.http import Request

# relative function's signature in this file
def make_requests_from_url(self, url):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def start_requests(self):
    if self.make_requests_from_url.__func__ is not Spider.make_requests_from_url.__func__:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```
