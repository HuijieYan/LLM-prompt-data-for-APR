The error message from the test function indicates that the test is failing because the number of warnings recorded is not as expected. It seems to be related to the warning message issued in the `start_requests` method of the `Spider` class.

The potential error location within the code is the comparison `if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url:`. This comparison might be causing the warning to be issued incorrectly.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the comparison is checking for inequality between two functions, which might not correctly represent the intended behavior. The warning is being issued based on this comparison, and it is impacting the test results.

To fix the bug, we can modify the comparison to check if the `make_requests_from_url` function of the current object is overridden. We can use the `.__func__` attribute to compare the functions properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `start_requests` method:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    if self.make_requests_from_url.__func__ is not Spider.make_requests_from_url:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```

With this modification, the comparison checks if the `make_requests_from_url` function of the current object is overridden, and issues the warning or yields the requests accordingly.
