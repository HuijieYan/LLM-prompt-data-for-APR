The potential error in the provided function is the if statement condition `if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url`. The intention of this conditional statement is to check if the method `make_requests_from_url` is overridden in the current class or if it is the original method from the `Spider` class. However, due to the use of the `is` keyword for method comparison, it is checking if the method references are the same, rather than checking if they are different methods with the same name.

This bug occurs because the comparison `self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url` is not semantically correct to compare methods.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to use the `!=` operator to compare the methods based on their names:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    if self.make_requests_from_url.__func__ != Spider.make_requests_from_url.__func__:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```

This change ensures that the `make_requests_from_url` method is correctly determined to be overridden.
