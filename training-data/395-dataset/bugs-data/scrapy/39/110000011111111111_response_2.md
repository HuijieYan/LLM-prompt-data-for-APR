The error occurs because the `start_requests` method is referencing `Spider.make_requests_from_url`, which is deprecated and replaced by overriding the `start_requests` method instead. The `start_requests` method should be updated to use `yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)` for all cases instead of the deprecated `make_requests_from_url` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `start_requests` method:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    warnings.warn(
        "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
        "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
        "Please override start_requests method instead."
    )
    for url in self.start_urls:
        yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```

With this change, the `start_requests` method will always yield a `Request` object for each URL in the `start_urls` attribute, eliminating the need to use the deprecated `make_requests_from_url` method.

This fix aligns with the deprecation of the `Spider.make_requests_from_url` method and requires the user to override the `start_requests` method for custom processing of initial requests.
