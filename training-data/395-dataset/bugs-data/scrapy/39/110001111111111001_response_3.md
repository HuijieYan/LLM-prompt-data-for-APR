The error occurs in the `test_make_requests_from_url_deprecated` test case when it compares the length of the warning list `w` with 0. The test is expecting no warning to be issued, but it fails because a warning is issued.

The issue in the `start_requests` method is that it checks for `self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url` condition. This check is causing the warning to be issued in the second test case because `MySpider5` class has overridden the `make_requests_from_url` method. The warning message is expected in this case, so the test should be updated accordingly.

To fix the bug, the condition should be removed from the `start_requests` method, as it is not necessary. The `start_requests` method should always call the overridden `make_requests_from_url` method if it exists.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    for url in self.start_urls:
        yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
```

The `start_requests` method has been simplified to always call the overridden `make_requests_from_url` method for each URL in `start_urls`. This resolves the issue of issuing a warning and is consistent with the intended behavior of allowing spider classes to override the `make_requests_from_url` method.
