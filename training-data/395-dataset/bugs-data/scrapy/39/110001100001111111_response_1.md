The bug occurs due to the comparison `if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url`. Since the `make_requests_from_url` method is a bound method of the class instance, the comparison will always be true and the warning will always be triggered.

To fix this bug, we can remove the comparison and directly use the `make_requests_from_url` method to yield requests. Here's the corrected code for the `start_requests` method:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    for url in self.start_urls:
        yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
```

This change will ensure that the requests are yielded using the `make_requests_from_url` method without triggering the warning.
