The buggy function `start_requests` is supposed to check if `make_requests_from_url` has been overridden and issue a warning if it has not been overridden. However, in the first input case, even though it is not overridden, it does not issue a warning. This is due to the incorrect comparison.

The issue in the current implementation is with the comparison `self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url`. This comparison checks for identity (whether the two variables refer to the same object), which is not suitable for checking if the method has been overridden.

To fix this, we can compare the actual method objects to see if they are the same. If they are the same, it implies that the method has not been overridden. If they are different, it means that the method has been overridden.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    if self.make_requests_from_url.__func__ is not Spider.make_requests_from_url:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```

In the corrected code, we use `self.make_requests_from_url.__func__` to access the underlying function object of the method. Then we compare it with `Spider.make_requests_from_url` to check if the method has been overridden. This will correctly identify whether the method has been overridden or not.
