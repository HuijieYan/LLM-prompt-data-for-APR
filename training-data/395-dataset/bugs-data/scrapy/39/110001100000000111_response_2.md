The issue is with the start_requests method in the provided code. The code checks if a method make_requests_from_url is equal to Spider.make_requests_from_url, but on the method definition line, there is no make_requests_from_url method defined. It appears that the intention was to call the make_requests_from_url method that was initially defined, but this is not the correct way to achieve that.

The code is trying to deprecate the make_requests_from_url method, suggesting to override the start_requests method instead.

To fix the bug, the start_requests method should be overridden and the make_requests_from_url method should be removed as it is deprecated. Instead, the logic for generating initial requests should be placed inside the start_requests method.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_39/scrapy/spiders/__init__.py

from scrapy import Request
import warnings

class YourSpiderClassName(Spider):
    name = 'your_spider_name'
    # ... other spider code ...

    def start_requests(self):
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)

```

In this corrected code, the start_requests method has been overridden to generate initial requests using Request and start_urls. The deprecated make_requests_from_url method has been removed and its logic has been moved to the start_requests method.
