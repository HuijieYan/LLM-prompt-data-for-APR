The error occurs in the `test_make_requests_from_url_deprecated` test case on the line `self.assertEqual(len(w), 0)`. The test is failing because the warning list `w` is not empty as expected. This indicates that the warning is not being issued as intended by the `start_requests` method.

The bug is occurring because the check `if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url` is comparing the "self" instance method to the class method. This comparison will always evaluate to `True`, causing the warning to be issued and potentially impacting the functionality of the `start_requests` method.

To fix the bug, instead of comparing the methods, a more appropriate check would be to see if the method is overridden in the current class.

Here's the corrected code for the `start_requests` method:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    if self.make_requests_from_url.__func__ is not Spider.make_requests_from_url:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```

By checking if the `make_requests_from_url` method's `__func__` attribute is different from the `Spider.make_requests_from_url` method, we can determine if it has been overridden in the current class.

This change ensures that the warning is only issued if the method has been overridden, as intended.
