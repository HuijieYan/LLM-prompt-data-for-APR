The error message indicates that the test case is failing at the assertion `self.assertEqual(len(w), 0)`. This suggests that the warnings are not being captured as expected.

The potential error in the buggy function is the comparison `if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url:`. This comparison is not correctly checking if the `make_requests_from_url` method is overridden in the subclass or not.

The bug occurs because `self.make_requests_from_url` is actually a bound method when accessed through an instance, so it will never be equal to `Spider.make_requests_from_url`, even if it is not overridden in the subclass.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the method is overridden by the subclass in a different way. We can use the `__func__` attribute of the method to compare it with `Spider.make_requests_from_url`:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    if self.make_requests_from_url.__func__ is not Spider.make_requests_from_url:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```

By using `self.make_requests_from_url.__func__`, we are comparing the original unbound method, which allows us to correctly check if it has been overridden in the subclass.
