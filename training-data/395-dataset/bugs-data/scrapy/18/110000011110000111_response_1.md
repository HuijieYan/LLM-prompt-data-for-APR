The error occurs in the `from_content_disposition` function, specifically in the line `filename = to_native_str(content_disposition).split(';')[1].split('=')[1]`. The error message indicates a `UnicodeDecodeError` with the message "'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xb5 in position 24: invalid start byte". This suggests that the encoding used is incorrect for the given byte sequence.

The issue is likely occurring because the content disposition is being decoded using the utf-8 encoding, but the actual encoding is different. For example, when trying to decode the byte sequence `b'attachment;filename=data\xb5.tar.gz'` using utf-8, it encounters an error because the byte sequence is not a valid utf-8 sequence.

To fix this issue, the function should use the appropriate encoding when decoding the content disposition header.

The corrected code for the `from_content_disposition` function is as follows:

```python
def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
    try:
        decoded_str = content_disposition.decode('latin-1')  # Use the appropriate encoding
        filename = decoded_str.split(';')[1].split('=')[1]
        filename = filename.strip('"\'')
        return self.from_filename(filename)
    except (IndexError, UnicodeDecodeError):
        return Response
```
