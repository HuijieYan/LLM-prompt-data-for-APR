The buggy function `from_content_disposition` is attempting to extract the filename from the `content_disposition` parameter, which is in the form of a bytes object. It then attempts to convert it to a string and split it to extract the filename. However, the function `to_native_str` is not defined, so it seems like an external function that could be causing the issue. Additionally, the code inside the try block may not handle all cases where the filename has different encodings or formats.

To fix the bug, the function should properly handle the encoding of the filename within the `content_disposition` parameter and ensure that it extracts the filename accurately in all cases.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class ResponseTypes(object):
    # ... omitted code ...


    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def from_filename(self, filename):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass



    # this is the corrected function
    def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
        try:
            content_str = content_disposition.decode('utf-8')  # decode the bytes to string
            filename = content_str.split(';')[1].split('=')[1]
            filename = filename.strip('"\'')
            return self.from_filename(filename)
        except (IndexError, UnicodeDecodeError) as e:
            return None  # handle exceptions by returning None or appropriate response
```

In the corrected code, we decode the `content_disposition` from bytes to a string using the `decode` method with the 'utf-8' encoding. This ensures that the encoding is handled properly. We also added a `UnicodeDecodeError` exception handling to cover cases where the decoding might fail. Finally, we handle the exceptions by returning None or an appropriate response instead of returning `Response` as the original code didn't define `Response`.
