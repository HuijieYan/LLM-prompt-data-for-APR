Potential error location: The bug is occurring in the from_content_disposition method. The try block is attempting to split the content_disposition string and retrieve the filename, but it is not handling cases where the content_disposition format is different than expected.

Reasons behind the bug: The code is assuming that the content_disposition string will always be in a specific format, and it does not account for cases where it may not follow this format. Additionally, the use of to_native_str is not defined in the provided code and may be causing issues.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the content_disposition string is in the expected format before attempting to split it. If not, handle this case gracefully.
2. Define the to_native_str method if it is crucial for the code to work.

Here's the corrected code for the from_content_disposition method:

```python
def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
    try:
        filename_parts = content_disposition.split(';')
        if len(filename_parts) > 1:
            filename = filename_parts[1].split('=')[1].strip('"\'')
            return self.from_filename(filename)
        else:
            return Response
    except IndexError:
        return Response
```

In this corrected code, we first check if the content_disposition string has at least two parts separated by a semicolon before attempting to extract the filename. If not, we return Response. This should handle cases where the content_disposition format is different than expected.
