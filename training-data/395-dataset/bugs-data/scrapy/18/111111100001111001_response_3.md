The bug in the `from_content_disposition` function occurs because the function is parsing the `content_disposition` header incorrectly. It is assuming that the filename is always the second item in the split list, but this is not always the case. This results in errors when trying to extract the filename from the `content_disposition` value.

To fix this bug, the function should handle parsing the content disposition header more carefully to ensure it correctly extracts the filename.

Here's the corrected code for the `from_content_disposition` function:

```python
def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
    try:
        dispositions = content_disposition.split(b';')
        filename = None
        for disp in dispositions:
            if b'filename' in disp:
                filename = disp.split(b'=')[-1].strip(b'"\'')
                break
        if filename:
            return self.from_filename(filename.decode('utf-8'))
        else:
            return Response
    except IndexError:
        return Response
```

In this corrected code, the `content_disposition` header is split on semicolons to extract all the different parameters. Then, within those parameters, it searches for the one containing the filename and retrieves the value following the equal sign. If it finds the filename, it converts it to a string and uses the `from_filename` function to further process it. If no filename parameter is found, it returns `Response`.
