The buggy function `from_content_disposition` is meant to extract the filename from the `content_disposition` parameter and then call the `from_filename` function to process the filename. The bug seems to arise from the use of the `to_native_str` function, which is not defined in the given code.

The function `to_native_str` is likely meant to convert the `content_disposition` from bytes to a string. Without this conversion, the splitting and manipulation of the filename may not work as expected, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we need to replace the use of `to_native_str` with the appropriate method for converting the byte value to a string. This can be achieved using the `decode` method for bytes objects, specifying the appropriate encoding (such as 'utf-8').

Here's the corrected code for the `from_content_disposition` function:

```python
def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
    try:
        filename = content_disposition.decode('utf-8').split(';')[1].split('=')[1]
        filename = filename.strip('"\'')
        return self.from_filename(filename)
    except IndexError:
        return Response
```

With this correction, the bug related to the encoding of the `content_disposition` byte value should be resolved, and the function should work as expected for the provided test cases.
