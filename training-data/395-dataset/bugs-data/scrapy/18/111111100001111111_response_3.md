The error is occurring in the `from_content_disposition` method of the `ResponseTypes` class. The error is related to decoding the `Content-Disposition` header using the UTF-8 encoding when the encoding might not be UTF-8.

The bug occurs because the `to_native_str` function is being used to decode the `Content-Disposition` header into a native string, assuming UTF-8 encoding. However, in case the encoding is different from UTF-8, it leads to a UnicodeDecodeError.

To fix this bug, we can use a more robust approach to decode the `Content-Disposition` header. We can first decode the header using appropriate encodings and then extract the filename from it.

Here's the corrected code for the `from_content_disposition` method:

```python
import re

class ResponseTypes(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
        try:
            # Decode the content-disposition using a combination of encodings (utf-8 and latin-1)
            content_disposition_str = content_disposition.decode('utf-8', errors='replace')
            if '?' in content_disposition_str:
                encoding, _, filename = content_disposition_str.partition('?')
                if encoding.lower() == 'utf-8':
                    return re.sub(r'(=[\w\d]{2})', lambda m: bytes.fromhex(m.group(1)[1:]).decode('utf-8'), filename)
                elif encoding.lower() == 'iso-8859-1':
                    return re.sub(r'(=[\w\d]{2})', lambda m: bytes.fromhex(m.group(1)[1:]).decode('latin-1'), filename)
            return content_disposition_str
        except (UnicodeDecodeError, IndexError):
            return Response
```

In the corrected code, we use the `decode` method with appropriate error handling to decode the `Content-Disposition` header. We also handle cases where the `Content-Disposition` header contains multiple encodings by checking for the presence of '?' in the header. Then, we use regular expressions to decode the filename part using the detected encoding. If the encoding is recognized as 'utf-8' or 'iso-8859-1', we use the corresponding decoding method to decode the filename.

This approach should handle a wider range of encodings and prevent the UnicodeDecodeError from occurring.
