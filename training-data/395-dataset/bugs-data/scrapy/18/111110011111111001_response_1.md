The error seems to be occurring when the `to_unicode` function tries to decode the `content_disposition` using the 'utf-8' encoding in the `from_content_disposition` method of the `ResponseTypes` class. This is likely due to incorrect encoding or formatting of the `content_disposition` string.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to ensure that the `content_disposition` string is properly decoded before further processing. This can be done by explicitly decoding the `content_disposition` using the 'utf-8' encoding when splitting and manipulating the string.

Here's the corrected code for the `from_content_disposition` method:

```python
def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
    try:
        if isinstance(content_disposition, bytes):
            filename = content_disposition.decode('utf-8').split(';')[1].split('=')[1]
        else:
            filename = content_disposition.split(';')[1].split('=')[1]
        filename = filename.strip('"\'')
        return self.from_filename(filename)
    except IndexError:
        return Response
```

By explicitly decoding the `content_disposition` using 'utf-8' encoding, we can avoid the `UnicodeDecodeError` that was occurring in the buggy implementation. This should fix the bug and allow the function to handle the `content_disposition` string correctly.
