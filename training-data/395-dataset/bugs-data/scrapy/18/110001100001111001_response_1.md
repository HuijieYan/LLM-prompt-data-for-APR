The bug is occurring because the `from_content_disposition` method is expecting the `content_disposition` argument to be a string, not bytes. Therefore, when it tries to split the content disposition using the `split` function, it encounters indexing issues.

To fix the bug, we need to decode the `content_disposition` bytes object into a string using the appropriate encoding. Then, we can proceed with the splitting logic as before.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
    try:
        content_disposition_str = content_disposition.decode('utf-8')  # Decode content_disposition bytes to string
        filename = to_native_str(content_disposition_str).split(';')[1].split('=')[1]
        filename = filename.strip('"\'')
        return self.from_filename(filename)
    except (IndexError, UnicodeDecodeError):  # Handle both IndexError and UnicodeDecodeError
        return Response  # Assuming Response is a variable object or type that should be returned here, replace with the appropriate value if necessary
```
