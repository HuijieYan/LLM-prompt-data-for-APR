The error occurs because the `from_content_disposition` function is trying to decode the `content_disposition` using utf-8, but the encoding was not actually utf-8.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `from_content_disposition` function to handle the decoding of `content_disposition` properly.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
    try:
        filename = content_disposition.split(';')[1].split('=')[1]
        filename = filename.strip('"\'')
        return self.from_filename(filename)
    except IndexError:
        return Response
```

In the corrected code, instead of using `to_native_str` which decodes the `content_disposition` using utf-8, we directly split the `content_disposition` string to get the filename. This avoids the utf-8 decoding error.
