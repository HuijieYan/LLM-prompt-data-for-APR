The error occurs because the content_disposition contains non-utf-8 characters, causing a UnicodeDecodeError when trying to decode it.

To fix this bug, we can modify the from_content_disposition function to handle the decoding of bytes data. Additionally, we should properly handle the cases when the filename is not found in the content_disposition.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
    try:
        content_disposition_str = content_disposition.decode('utf-8')
        filename = content_disposition_str.split(';')[1].split('=')[1]
        filename = filename.strip('"\'')
        return self.from_filename(filename)
    except (IndexError, UnicodeDecodeError):
        return Response
```

In the corrected function, we first decode the content_disposition bytes object into a string using the 'utf-8' encoding. Then we proceed with extracting the filename and returning the appropriate response. We handle both IndexError and UnicodeDecodeError exceptions.

With these changes, the function should be able to handle the given test cases without raising a UnicodeDecodeError.
