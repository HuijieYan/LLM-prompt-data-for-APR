The buggy function "from_content_disposition" attempts to extract the filename from the "Content-Disposition" header. However, the bug occurs because the input parameter "content_disposition" is encoded as bytes, and the function attempts to decode this as a string using "to_native_str". This causes issues when the byte string contains non-UTF-8 characters.

To fix this bug, the function should first decode the byte string into a Unicode string using the appropriate encoding. Then, the filename can be extracted safely.

Here's the corrected code for the "from_content_disposition" function:

```python
def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
    try:
        content_disposition_str = content_disposition.decode('utf-8')  # Decode the byte string to Unicode string
        filename = content_disposition_str.split(';')[1].split('=')[1]
        filename = filename.strip('"\'')
        return self.from_filename(filename)
    except (IndexError, UnicodeDecodeError):
        return Response
```

In this corrected code, we decode the "content_disposition" byte string using the 'utf-8' encoding before attempting to split and extract the filename. This should resolve the UnicodeDecodeError while handling non-UTF-8 characters safely.
