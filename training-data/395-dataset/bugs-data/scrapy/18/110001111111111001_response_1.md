The error occurs because the `content_disposition` is encoded in a format that is not compatible with the `utf-8` encoding that is being used to decode it in the `from_content_disposition` function. This mismatch in encodings leads to a `UnicodeDecodeError`.

To fix this bug, the code should be modified to handle different encodings for `content_disposition`. This could be achieved by using the `chardet` library to detect the encoding of `content_disposition` and then decode it accordingly.

Here's the corrected code with the necessary changes:

```python
import chardet
import six
from scrapy.responsetypes import ResponseTypes
from scrapy.http import Response

def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
    try:
        # Detect the encoding of content_disposition
        encoding = chardet.detect(content_disposition)['encoding']
        if encoding:
            filename = content_disposition.decode(encoding).split(';')[1].split('=')[1].strip('"\'')

            return self.from_filename(filename)
        else:
            # If encoding cannot be detected, use utf-8 as the default encoding
            filename = content_disposition.decode('utf-8').split(';')[1].split('=')[1].strip('"\'')

            return self.from_filename(filename)
    except IndexError:
        return Response
```

With these changes, the function should be able to handle different encodings for `content_disposition` and avoid the UnicodeDecodeError.
