Potential error location: The error likely occurs in the line where the code attempts to decode the `Content-Disposition` using utf-8.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the code assumes the `Content-Disposition` header is encoded using utf-8, but in this case, the encoding is not UTF-8.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Instead of assuming utf-8 encoding, the code can try to decode the header using a different encoding, such as latin-1, and handle any potential decoding errors.
2. Use a decoding strategy that can handle a wider range of characters, such as Python's `email.header.decode_header` function.
3. Catch the UnicodeDecodeError and handle it gracefully, possibly by falling back to a default filename if the decoding fails.

The corrected code for the problematic function 'from_content_disposition' can be as follows:

```python
def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
    try:
        from email.header import decode_header

        header_parts = decode_header(content_disposition)
        filename = header_parts[0][0].decode(header_parts[0][1] or 'utf-8')  # try to decode using the provided encoding, default to utf-8
        return self.from_filename(filename)
    except (IndexError, UnicodeDecodeError):
        return Response
```
