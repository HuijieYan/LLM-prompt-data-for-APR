Potential error location: 
The potential error in the code is in the line `filename = to_native_str(content_disposition).split(';')[1].split('=')[1]`. This line is trying to split the content disposition string and extract the filename, but there is no handling for cases where the content disposition is not in the expected format.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the code assumes that the content disposition will always be in the format "attachment; filename='filename'", but this is not always the case. If the content disposition is in a different format or does not contain a filename, the code will raise an IndexError when trying to access the filename.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the content disposition contains the "filename" parameter before splitting it.
2. Add error handling for cases where the content disposition is not in the expected format.

Corrected code:
```python
def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
    try:
        parts = content_disposition.split(';')
        for part in parts:
            if 'filename=' in part:
                filename = part.split('=')[1].strip('"\'')
                return self.from_filename(filename)
        raise ValueError("Filename not found in content disposition")
    except (IndexError, ValueError):
        return Response
```
