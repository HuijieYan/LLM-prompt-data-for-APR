1. The test case `test_from_content_disposition` provides various combinations of content disposition headers along with their expected response types. 

2. The error occurs in the `from_content_disposition` function of the `ResponseTypes` class. The error is triggered when trying to decode the content disposition using utf-8, but the encoding may not be utf-8.

3. The error occurs because the `to_native_str` function attempts to decode the `content_disposition` using utf-8, and this fails when the actual encoding is not utf-8.

4. To fix the bug, we can modify the `from_content_disposition` function to handle the encoding properly by using a try-except block to catch the `UnicodeDecodeError` and attempting to decode the text with different encodings. If the decoding succeeds with a specific encoding, we can split the string and extract the filename as intended.

5. Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class ResponseTypes(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
        try:
            encodings = ['utf-8', 'latin-1', 'gbk', 'cp720', 'iso2022_jp']  # Add additional encodings as needed
            for encoding in encodings:
                try:
                    filename = to_native_str(content_disposition, encoding).split(';')[1].split('=')[1]
                    filename = filename.strip('"\'')
                    return self.from_filename(filename)
                except (IndexError, UnicodeDecodeError):
                    pass
            return Response
        except IndexError:
            return Response
```

With the updated `from_content_disposition` function, the `content_disposition` is attempted to be decoded using various encodings until a successful decoding occurs. Once the decoding is successful, the string is split to extract the filename and return the appropriate response type.
