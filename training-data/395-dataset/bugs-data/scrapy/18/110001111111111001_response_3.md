The error occurs because the `from_content_disposition` function is trying to decode the byte strings using the wrong encoding. This is evident from the error message `UnicodeDecodeError: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xb5 in position 24: invalid start byte`. It means that the `content_disposition` is being decoded using UTF-8, but some byte sequences are not valid in UTF-8 encoding.

To fix this bug, the function should use a different approach to decode the byte strings or handle the decoding errors gracefully.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
    try:
        filename = content_disposition.decode('utf-8').split(';')[1].split('=')[1]
        filename = filename.strip('"\'')
        return self.from_filename(filename)
    except (IndexError, UnicodeDecodeError):
        return Response
```

In this corrected code, we explicitly decode the `content_disposition` byte string using UTF-8 encoding and catch any `UnicodeDecodeError` that may occur. If an `IndexError` or `UnicodeDecodeError` occurs, it returns `Response` as per the original implementation.
