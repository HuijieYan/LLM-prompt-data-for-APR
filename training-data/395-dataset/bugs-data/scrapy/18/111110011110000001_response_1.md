The error message indicates a UnicodeDecodeError occurring due to the attempt to decode a byte string using the 'utf-8' encoding where the byte at position 24 cannot be decoded. This means that the 'utf-8' encoding is not suitable for decoding the byte string.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the line `filename = to_native_str(content_disposition).split(';')[1].split('=')[1]`, where the content_disposition value is being decoded using the 'utf-8' encoding.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the decoding of the byte string using a suitable encoding that can handle the characters present in the content_disposition value. Additionally, we should consider handling different types of encodings for the content_disposition byte string.

Here's the corrected code for the from_content_disposition function:

```python
class ResponseTypes(object):
    # ...

    def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
        try:
            filename = content_disposition.decode('latin-1').split(';')[1].split('=')[1]
            filename = filename.strip('"\'')
            return self.from_filename(filename)
        except IndexError:
            return Response
```

In the corrected code, we have used the 'latin-1' encoding to decode the content_disposition byte string. This is one of the encodings that can handle a wide range of characters and is more suitable than 'utf-8' for decoding.
