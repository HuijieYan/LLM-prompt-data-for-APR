The issue is caused by the incorrect handling of the `Content-Disposition` header in the `from_content_disposition` method of `ResponseTypes` class. The method tries to decode the header using the `to_native_str()` function with the `utf-8` encoding, which leads to a `UnicodeDecodeError` when the encoding is not actually `utf-8`.

Here's the corrected `from_content_disposition` method:

```python
def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
        try:
            if isinstance(content_disposition, bytes):
                content_disposition = content_disposition.decode('latin-1')  # Decode using latin-1 as a fallback
            filename = content_disposition.split(';')[1].split('=')[1].strip('"\'')
            return self.from_filename(filename)
        except (IndexError, UnicodeError):  # Catch both IndexError and UnicodeError
            return Response
```

In this correction, we first check if the `content_disposition` is of type `bytes` and decode it using the `latin-1` encoding as a fallback. Then, we proceed with splitting and trimming the filename. We also catch both `IndexError` and `UnicodeError` to handle potential issues with splitting and decoding.

This corrected version should address the `UnicodeDecodeError` issue and improve the robustness of the `from_content_disposition` method.
