The potential error in the problematic function is the use of "Response" instead of "None" in the "except IndexError" block. The purpose of this function is to extract the filename from the content_disposition string and then use the extracted filename to call the "from_filename" function. 

The bug occurs because when the split operations in the "filename" assignment fail due to IndexError, the function should return None (indicating failure to extract the filename), but it is currently returning "Response" which is not a valid object.

To fix this bug, we need to update the "except IndexError" block to return None instead of Response.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
    try:
        filename = to_native_str(content_disposition).split(';')[1].split('=')[1]
        filename = filename.strip('"\'')
        return self.from_filename(filename)
    except IndexError:
        return None
```
