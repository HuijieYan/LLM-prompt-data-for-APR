Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the code is within the `from_content_disposition` function. Specifically, the split method is being used without first checking if there is a valid filename in the content_disposition.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug likely occurs when the content_disposition does not contain a valid filename. This causes the split method to throw an IndexError, leading to the function returning Response instead of handling the error gracefully.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the content_disposition contains a valid filename before attempting to split it.
2. Handle the IndexError exception gracefully and return a default value or raise an error.

Corrected Code:
```python
def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
    try:
        if content_disposition and len(content_disposition.split(';')) > 1:
            filename = to_native_str(content_disposition).split(';')[1].split('=')[1]
            filename = filename.strip('"\'')
            return self.from_filename(filename)
        else:
            return Response
    except IndexError:
        return Response
```
In the corrected code, we first check if the content_disposition contains at least one semicolon before attempting to split it. This prevents the IndexError from occurring and allows us to handle non-valid filenames gracefully.
