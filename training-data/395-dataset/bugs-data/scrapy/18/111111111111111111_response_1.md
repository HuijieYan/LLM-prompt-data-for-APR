The error is occurring in the `to_native_str` function when trying to decode the `content_disposition` using the 'utf-8' encoding. This causes a `UnicodeDecodeError` because the `content_disposition` is not always encoded in 'utf-8'.

The reason behind the bug is that the function assumes the `content_disposition` is always encoded in 'utf-8', which is not the case.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `from_content_disposition` function to handle different encodings present in the `content_disposition` header.

Here's the corrected code for the `from_content_disposition` function:

```python
def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
    try:
        if isinstance(content_disposition, bytes):
            content_disposition = content_disposition.decode('utf-8', errors='replace')
        filename = content_disposition.split(';')[1].split('=')[1]
        filename = filename.strip('"\'')
        return self.from_filename(filename)
    except (IndexError, UnicodeDecodeError):
        return Response
```

In this corrected code:
- First, we check if the `content_disposition` is of type `bytes` and decode it using the 'utf-8' encoding.
- Then we proceed with splitting and extracting the filename as before.
- We also handle the `UnicodeDecodeError` explicitly.

This should resolve the Unicode decoding issue and handle different encodings present in the `content_disposition` header.
