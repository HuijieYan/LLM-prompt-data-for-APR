The error is occurring in the `to_native_str` function in the `scrapy/utils/python.py` file. The error message indicates that there is a UnicodeDecodeError because the byte sequence `b'attachment;filename=data\xb5.tar.gz'` cannot be decoded using the 'utf-8' codec.

The reason behind this bug is that the `to_native_str` function is attempting to decode a byte sequence using the 'utf-8' codec, which is failing due to the presence of non-UTF-8 characters in the byte sequence.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `from_content_disposition` function to use the correct encoding when decoding the byte sequence. Also, we can handle exceptions that might occur during the decoding process.

Here's the corrected code for the `from_content_disposition` function:

```python
def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
    try:
        if isinstance(content_disposition, bytes):
            content_disposition = content_disposition.decode('utf-8')
        filename = content_disposition.split(';')[1].split('=')[1]
        filename = filename.strip('"\'')
        return self.from_filename(filename)
    except (IndexError, UnicodeDecodeError):
        return Response
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the `content_disposition` is a byte sequence and then decode it using the 'utf-8' codec. We also handle the potential IndexError and UnicodeDecodeError exceptions that might occur during the decoding and splitting process.
