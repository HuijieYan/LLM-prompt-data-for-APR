The error occurs when the function `from_content_disposition` tries to decode the `content_disposition` using UTF-8 encoding, resulting in a UnicodeDecodeError due to an invalid byte in the input.

The bug occurs because the function assumes that the `Content-Disposition` header can be decoded using UTF-8 encoding, which is not always the case. To fix the bug, we need to use a more robust method to handle the decoding of the `Content-Disposition` header.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
    try:
        _, params = cgi.parse_header(content_disposition)
        filename = params["filename"]
        return self.from_filename(filename)
    except KeyError:
        return Response
```

In the corrected code, we use `cgi.parse_header` to parse the `Content-Disposition` header and extract the filename. This method is more robust and handles the encoding of the header automatically, avoiding the UnicodeDecodeError that occurred in the original code.
