The error is occurring in the `to_unicode` function within the `scrapy.utils.python` module. This is because the `to_native_str` function is trying to decode the `content_disposition` using the UTF-8 encoding, which may not be the correct encoding. This leads to a `UnicodeDecodeError` when the incorrect encoding is used.

To fix this bug, we need to use the correct encoding for decoding the `content_disposition`. Since the encoding is not explicitly provided, we can use a try-except block to handle the decoding and fallback to a default encoding if the provided encoding fails.

Here's the corrected code for the `from_content_disposition` function:

```python
def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
    try:
        filename = content_disposition.split(b'filename=')[1].strip(b'\'"').decode('utf-8', 'ignore')
        return self.from_filename(filename)
    except IndexError:
        return Response
```

In this corrected code, we directly split the `content_disposition` using the `b'filename='` string and then strip any quotes or double quotes. We then decode the filename using the 'utf-8' encoding and ignore any decoding errors. This should handle various encodings for the filename and prevent the `UnicodeDecodeError` from occurring.

This approach will make the `from_content_disposition` function more robust by handling different encodings for filenames and preventing decoding errors.
