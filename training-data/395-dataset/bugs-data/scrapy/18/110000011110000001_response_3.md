The error is occurring in the `to_native_str` function when trying to decode the bytes object `text` using utf-8 encoding. The byte sequence `0xb5` is not a valid start byte in utf-8 encoding, which is causing the `UnicodeDecodeError`.

The potential error location within the `from_content_disposition` function is the `to_native_str(content_disposition)` call.

The bug occurred because the encoding of the byte sequence is not utf-8, and therefore attempting to decode it using utf-8 is causing the UnicodeDecodeError.

To fix the bug, we can specify the correct encoding when decoding the byte sequence. We can also handle any potential decoding errors.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
    try:
        filename = to_native_str(content_disposition, 'latin-1').split(';')[1].split('=')[1]
        filename = filename.strip('"\'')
        return self.from_filename(filename)
    except IndexError:
        return Response
```
