Potential error location: The problematic part of the function is the line `return self.from_filename(filename)`, as this is where the function is trying to call the `from_filename` method but it's not defined within the `from_content_disposition` function.

Reasons for the bug: The bug occurs because the `from_content_disposition` function is trying to call the `from_filename` method without it being defined within the `from_content_disposition` function.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: To fix this bug, the `from_filename` method should be either defined within the `from_content_disposition` function or as a separate method that can be called by `from_content_disposition`.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_18/scrapy/responsetypes.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def from_filename(self, filename):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# corrected from_content_disposition function
def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
    try:
        filename = to_native_str(content_disposition).split(';')[1].split('=')[1]
        filename = filename.strip('"\'')
        return self.from_filename(filename)
    except IndexError:
        return Response
```
