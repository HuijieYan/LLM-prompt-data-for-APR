Potential error location: The error occurs at the line `filename = to_native_str(content_disposition).split(';')[1].split('=')[1]` within the `from_content_disposition` function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The error occurs because the `content_disposition` is being decoded using the utf-8 encoding, but the encoding was not actually utf-8.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Since the `content_disposition` is not encoded in utf-8, we should avoid decoding it using utf-8.
2. We can use string manipulation methods to extract the filename from the `content_disposition` header without decoding it using utf-8.

Corrected code:
```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class ResponseTypes(object):
    # ... omitted code ...


    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def from_filename(self, filename):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass


    # the corrected function
    def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
        filename = content_disposition.split(';')[1].split('=')[1]
        filename = filename.strip('"\'')
        return self.from_filename(filename)
```
