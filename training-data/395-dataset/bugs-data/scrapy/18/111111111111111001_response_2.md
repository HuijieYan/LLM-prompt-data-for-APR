The error message indicates a 'UnicodeDecodeError' while trying to decode a byte string using the 'utf-8' codec. This error occurs during an attempt to convert the byte string `b'attachment;filename=data\xb5.tar.gz'` to a native string.

The bug appears to be in the line:
```
filename = to_native_str(content_disposition).split(';')[1].split('=')[1]
```
The code here is trying to decode the byte string using the 'utf-8' codec, which raises the UnicodeDecodeError due to invalid bytes.

To fix this bug, we should modify the method to handle the decoding of byte strings more gracefully. We can decode the byte string using different codecs based on the content and then return the filename obtained. Additionally, it's a good practice to handle the exception in case the expected index is missing from the split list.

Here's the corrected code for the `from_content_disposition` method:

```python
import six

def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
    try:
        if isinstance(content_disposition, six.binary_type):
            content_disposition = content_disposition.decode('utf-8', 'ignore')

        filename = content_disposition.split(';')[1].split('=')[1].strip('"\'')
        return self.from_filename(filename)
    except (IndexError, UnicodeDecodeError):
        return Response
```

In this corrected code:
- `six.binary_type` is used to check if the content_disposition is a bytes object, and then it's decoded using 'utf-8'.
- The decoded string is then processed to extract the filename.
- We also catch the IndexError and UnicodeDecodeError to return a default Response if there were any issues during string processing or decoding.
