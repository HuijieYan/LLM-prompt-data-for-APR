The bug is caused by the incorrect decoding of the `Content-Disposition` header. The code attempts to decode the `content_disposition` byte string using the `to_native_str` function, which seems to decode it as UTF-8. This causes issues when the content disposition header contains non-UTF-8 characters.

To fix the bug, the decoding of the `content_disposition` header should be handled more carefully to avoid decoding errors.

Corrected function:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class ResponseTypes(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def from_filename(self, filename):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # the fixed function
    def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
        try:
            filename = content_disposition.decode('utf-8').split(';')[1].split('=')[1]
            filename = filename.strip('"\'')
            return self.from_filename(filename)
        except (IndexError, UnicodeDecodeError):
            return None  # Return default value or handle the error as per requirements
```

This corrected function first attempts to decode the `content_disposition` byte string using UTF-8. It then processes the filename as needed. If there is an index error or a Unicode decode error, it catches the exception and handles it appropriately, such as returning a default value or logging an error message.
