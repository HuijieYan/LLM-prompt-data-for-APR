The error occurs because the `from_content_disposition` function is trying to decode byte strings using the `utf-8` encoding, which is causing a `UnicodeDecodeError` for some non-utf-8 characters.

To fix this bug, we need to handle different character encodings appropriately based on the source of the filename.

Updated and correct function:

```python
def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
    try:
        filename = to_native_str(content_disposition).split(';')[1].split('=')[1]
        filename = filename.strip('"\'')
        return self.from_filename(filename)
    except IndexError:
        return Response

```
