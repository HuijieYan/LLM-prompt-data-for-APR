Potential error location: 
The potential error is occurring at `filename = to_native_str(content_disposition).split(';')[1].split('=')[1]` where it is attempting to extract the filename from the content disposition. If the content disposition does not contain the filename in the expected format, an IndexError will be raised when trying to access the index 1 in the split result.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug is occurring because the function assumes that the content disposition will always contain the filename in the expected format. If the format is different, it will result in an IndexError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Implement a more robust parsing of the content disposition header to ensure that the filename is extracted reliably.
2. Handle the exception more gracefully to provide a fallback behavior in case of an IndexError.
3. Validate the content disposition format before attempting to extract the filename.

Corrected code:
```python
def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
        try:
            filename = None
            parts = content_disposition.split(';')
            for part in parts:
                if part.strip().startswith('filename='):
                    filename = part.split('=')[1].strip(' "')
            if filename:
                return self.from_filename(filename)
            else:
                return None  # Indicate no filename found
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"Error processing content disposition: {e}")
            return None
```
