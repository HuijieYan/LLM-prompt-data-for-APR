The error is occurring because the `to_native_str` function is trying to decode the `content_disposition` using the 'utf-8' encoding, but the encoding might not be 'utf-8'. This is causing a `UnicodeDecodeError`.

To fix this bug, we need to correctly handle different encodings present in `content_disposition`. This can be done by using the `email` module to parse the `Content-Disposition` header and extract the filename.

Here's the corrected implementation of the `from_content_disposition` method:

```python
import email
import six

class ResponseTypes(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def from_filename(self, filename):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # corrected function
    def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
        _, params = email.header.decode_header(content_disposition)[0]
        
        if six.PY3:
            filename = params.decode('utf-8') if isinstance(params, bytes) else params
        else:
            filename = params

        return self.from_filename(filename)
```

With this corrected implementation, we are using the `email.header.decode_header` function to safely handle different encodings present in the `Content-Disposition` header. This should resolve the issue and decode the filename correctly.
