The bug is related to decoding the `Content-Disposition` header incorrectly using the utf-8 codec. The input parameter `content_disposition` is of type bytes, and when trying to split it using the `to_native_str` function, it is being decoded with the utf-8 codec, leading to the UnicodeDecodeError.

The bug is occurring because the `content_disposition` header may contain non-utf-8 characters, leading to the UnicodeDecodeError.

To fix the bug, the `from_content_disposition` function should avoid decoding the `content_disposition` header using the utf-8 codec. Instead, it should manipulate and process the bytes directly without decoding them to a string.

Here's the corrected code for the `from_content_disposition` function:

```python
def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
    try:
        filename = content_disposition.split(b';')[1].split(b'=')[1]
        filename = filename.strip(b'"\'').decode('utf-8', errors='ignore')
        return self.from_filename(filename)
    except (IndexError, UnicodeDecodeError):
        return Response
```

In the corrected code, we are directly working with bytes and decoding the filename using utf-8 with the `errors='ignore'` parameter to prevent the UnicodeDecodeError.
