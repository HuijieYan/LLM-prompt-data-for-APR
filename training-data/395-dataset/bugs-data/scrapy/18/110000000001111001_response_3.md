The buggy function `from_content_disposition` is meant to extract the filename from the `content_disposition` header and then pass it to the `from_filename` method for further processing. However, there are several issues in the current implementation:

1. The function assumes the position of the filename in the `content_disposition` header. This assumption can lead to errors, as the filename may not always be in the same position.

2. The splitting of the content disposition and extraction of filename is not handling different cases where the filename may or may not be enclosed in quotes.

3. The use of `to_native_str` is not necessary as it converts the bytes to a native string, which can lead to encoding issues.

To fix these issues, we can modify the function to use regular expressions to extract the filename in a more robust way.

Here's the corrected code for the `from_content_disposition` function:

```python
import re

def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
    try:
        content_disposition_str = content_disposition.decode('utf-8')
        match = re.search(r'filename=["\']?([^"\';]+)', content_disposition_str)
        filename = match.group(1)
        return self.from_filename(filename)
    except (IndexError, AttributeError):
        return Response
```

In this corrected code:
- We are using `re.search` to find the filename within the `content_disposition` string.
- The regular expression `filename=["\']?([^"\'\;]+)` looks for the pattern 'filename=' followed by an optional quote, and then captures the filename itself.
- We are decoding the content disposition bytes to a UTF-8 string before applying the regex.

With these changes, the function becomes more robust and should handle different variations of the `content_disposition` header more effectively.
