The error occurs because the `from_content_disposition` function is trying to decode a byte string using utf-8 encoding, but the byte string contains characters that are not compatible with utf-8 encoding.

To fix the bug:
1. We need to modify the `from_content_disposition` function to handle different encodings.
2. We should also handle the case where the filename may not exist in the content disposition header.

Here's the corrected code for the `from_content_disposition` function:

```python
def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
    filename = None
    try:
        content_disposition = content_disposition.decode('utf-8', 'ignore')
        filename = content_disposition.split(';')[1].split('=')[1]
        filename = filename.strip('"\'')
    except (IndexError, UnicodeDecodeError):
        pass

    if filename:
        return self.from_filename(filename)
    else:
        return Response
```
