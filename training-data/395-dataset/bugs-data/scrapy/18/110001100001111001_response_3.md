# The buggy function is from_content_disposition and it is responsible for extracting the filename from the content_disposition header and then passing it to the from_filename method.

# The bug in the function is due to the incorrect indexing used to extract the filename from the content_disposition header. In some cases, the additional characters like "=" and quotes are not accounted for.

# To fix the bug, the function needs to use a more robust method to extract the filename from the content_disposition header. This can be achieved by using regular expressions to match the filename pattern and extract it.

# Here's the corrected code for the from_content_disposition function:

```python
import re

def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
    try:
        content_disposition_str = content_disposition.decode('utf-8')  # Convert bytes to string
        matches = re.findall('filename="([^"]+)"', content_disposition_str)
        if matches:
            filename = matches[0]
            return self.from_filename(filename)
        else:
            return Response
    except Exception as e:
        # Handle the exception, possibly by logging it and returning an appropriate response
        return Response
```
