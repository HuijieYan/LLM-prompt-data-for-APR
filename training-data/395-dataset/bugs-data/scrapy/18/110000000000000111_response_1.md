The error message indicates a UnicodeDecodeError within the `from_content_disposition` function, particularly in the line `to_native_str(content_disposition).split(';')[1].split('=')[1]`. This suggests that the `content_disposition` variable is being decoded using UTF-8 encoding, resulting in the error.

The reason behind the bug is that the `content_disposition` header is being decoded using the UTF-8 codec, but the actual encoding of the header is not UTF-8, leading to a UnicodeDecodeError.

To fix the bug, the function should decode the `content_disposition` header using the correct encoding. In this case, it seems like the correct encoding is not known, so an approach would be to use a different method to extract the filename from the `content_disposition` header without decoding it.

Here's the corrected code for the `from_content_disposition` function:

```python
def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
    filename = content_disposition.split(';')[1].split('=')[1]
    filename = filename.strip('"\'')
    return self.from_filename(filename)
```

By not decoding the `content_disposition` header, we avoid the UnicodeDecodeError caused by using the wrong encoding.
