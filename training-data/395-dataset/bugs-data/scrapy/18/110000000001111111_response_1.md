The bug in the provided function is related to the decoding of the `content_disposition` header. The function attempts to split the `content_disposition` using the ';' character, and then it further splits the resulting array using the '=' character. However, this method is not reliable, especially for non-ASCII characters, which leads to the UnicodeDecodeError mentioned in the GitHub issue.

The occurrence of the bug is due to the assumption that the `content_disposition` header can be split using the ';' and '=' characters, which may not always be the case. The header may contain non-ASCII characters or follow a different format.

To fix this bug, we can use the `email` module in Python to parse the `content_disposition` header and extract the filename. This module is designed to handle email headers, including Content-Disposition headers, and is more reliable for parsing such headers.

Here's the corrected function using the `email` module:

```python
import email

def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
    try:
        _, params = email.header.decode_header(content_disposition.decode())[0]
        if isinstance(params, bytes):
            filename = params.decode()
        else:
            filename = params
        return self.from_filename(filename)
    except IndexError:
        return Response
```

In this corrected function, we first decode the `content_disposition` header using `decode()`, and then use the `email.header.decode_header` function to parse it. We extract the filename from the parsed result and return it with `self.from_filename` method.

This approach ensures that the `content_disposition` header is correctly decoded and parsed, addressing the UnicodeDecodeError and making the function more robust for different header formats.
