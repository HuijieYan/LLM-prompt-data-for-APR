Summary
Generate a warning or error if from_crawler() for a middleware/extension/etc. returns None

Motivation
I created a custom extension and connected signals in the from_crawler() classmethod, but neglected to return the new extension instance. Scrapy still reported the extension under "Enabled extensions", but none of the signals worked, since the instance was immediately garbage collected and its signals were silently disconnected.

This was of course an error on my part, but it would have saved me a lot of debugging if I had gotten a warning that from_crawler() was returning None, or if the extension were removed from the "Enabled extensions" list.

Would it be appropriate for utils.misc.create_instance() to raise an error or generate a warning if it's about to return None? Or should MiddlewareManager treat create_instance() returning None the same as create_instance() raising NotConfigured?
```
