# buggy function docstring

```text
Construct a class instance using its ``from_crawler`` or
``from_settings`` constructors, if available.

At least one of ``settings`` and ``crawler`` needs to be different from
``None``. If ``settings `` is ``None``, ``crawler.settings`` will be used.
If ``crawler`` is ``None``, only the ``from_settings`` constructor will be
tried.

``*args`` and ``**kwargs`` are forwarded to the constructors.

Raises ``ValueError`` if both ``settings`` and ``crawler`` are ``None``.
```
