The error is occurring because the 'BOT_NAME' key is not present in the settings dictionary passed when initializing the CrawlerProcess.

The problematic function is the '__init__' method of the CrawlerProcess class. The issue is that after calling the super class' '__init__', it tries to access the 'BOT_NAME' key from the settings dictionary, which is not guaranteed to be present.

To fix this issue, one approach is to ensure that the 'BOT_NAME' key is present in the settings dictionary before accessing it. Another approach could be to provide a default value for 'BOT_NAME' in case it is not present in the settings.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self, settings):
    super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
    install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
    configure_logging(settings)
    if 'BOT_NAME' in settings:
        log_scrapy_info(settings)
```
