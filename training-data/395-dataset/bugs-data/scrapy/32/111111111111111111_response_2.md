The error occurs because the 'BOT_NAME' key is missing from the settings dictionary when calling the log_scrapy_info function. This means that the settings dictionary is not properly initialized or populated before being used in the log_scrapy_info function.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the 'BOT_NAME' key is present in the settings dictionary before calling the log_scrapy_info function. One approach to do this is to initialize the settings with default values, including 'BOT_NAME', if they are not provided during the instantiation of the CrawlerProcess.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self, settings):
    if 'BOT_NAME' not in settings:
        settings['BOT_NAME'] = 'ScrapyBot'  # Set a default value for 'BOT_NAME' if not provided

    super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
    install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
    configure_logging(settings)
    log_scrapy_info(settings)
```

With this fix, the 'BOT_NAME' key will be present in the settings dictionary, preventing the KeyError when calling the log_scrapy_info function.
