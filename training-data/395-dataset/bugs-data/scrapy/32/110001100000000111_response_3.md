The potential error in the provided function is that it is missing the superclass argument in the constructor call. Additionally, the 'install_shutdown_handlers' and 'configure_logging' functions are not defined within the provided code snippet, so they need to be imported or implemented.

To fix the bug, we need to add the superclass argument in the constructor call and either import or implement the 'install_shutdown_handlers' and 'configure_logging' functions.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_32/scrapy/crawler.py

class CrawlerProcess:
    def __init__(self, spidercls, settings):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def _signal_shutdown(self, signum, _):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def __init__(self, settings):
        super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
        install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)  # assuming install_shutdown_handlers is defined or imported
        configure_logging(settings)  # assuming configure_logging is defined or imported
        log_scrapy_info(settings)
```

In the corrected code, I have added the superclass argument 'spidercls' to the first __init__ method, assuming that 'spidercls' is the superclass of 'CrawlerProcess'. I have also assumed that the 'install_shutdown_handlers' and 'configure_logging' functions are defined or imported correctly.
