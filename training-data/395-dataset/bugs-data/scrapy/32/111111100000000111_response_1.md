The potential error location within the problematic function is the way the `__init__` method is being defined multiple times with the same signature, causing confusion and possibly the wrong method being called.

The buggy function is having multiple `__init__` methods in the `CrawlerProcess` class which is causing confusion and ambiguity in calling the right method.

Approach to fix the bug:
1. Remove the duplicate `__init__` methods and keep only one `__init__` method in the `CrawlerProcess` class.
2. Ensure that the `__init__` method calls the necessary functions and super class's `__init__` method correctly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class CrawlerProcess(CrawlerRunner):
    """
    A class to run multiple scrapy crawlers in a process simultaneously.
    
    This class extends :class:`~scrapy.crawler.CrawlerRunner` by adding support
    for starting a Twisted `reactor`_ and handling shutdown signals, like the
    keyboard interrupt command Ctrl-C. It also configures top-level logging.
    
    This utility should be a better fit than
    :class:`~scrapy.crawler.CrawlerRunner` if you aren't running another
    Twisted `reactor`_ within your application.
    
    The CrawlerProcess object must be instantiated with a
    :class:`~scrapy.settings.Settings` object.
    
    This class shouldn't be needed (since Scrapy is responsible of using it
    accordingly) unless writing scripts that manually handle the crawling
    process. See :ref:`run-from-script` for an example.
    """
