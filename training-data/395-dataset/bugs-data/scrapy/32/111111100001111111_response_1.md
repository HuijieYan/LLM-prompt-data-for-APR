Error:
The problematic function `__init__` in the `CrawlerProcess` class is defined multiple times with the same signature. This will cause the later defined `__init__` function to override the earlier defined ones, leading to inconsistency and potential errors in the program.

Reason for the occurrence of the bug:
The `__init__` function is redefined multiple times within the `CrawlerProcess` class with the same signature, which is not allowed in Python. This causes the later defined `__init__` function to override the earlier ones, leading to the loss of necessary initialization code.

Approach to fix the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to remove the redundant definitions of the `__init__` function and keep only one with the required functionality.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self, settings):
    super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
    install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
    configure_logging(settings)
    log_scrapy_info(settings)
```
By providing a single definition of the `__init__` function with the correct signature, we ensure that the initialization code will be executed properly without any conflicts.
