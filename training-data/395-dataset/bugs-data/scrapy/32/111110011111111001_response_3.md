The error occurs because the `log_scrapy_info` function is trying to access the `'BOT_NAME'` key in the `settings` dictionary, which is not present. This is causing a `KeyError` to be raised.

To fix this bug, the `settings` dictionary should be updated to include the `'BOT_NAME'` key with an appropriate value. This can be done either by providing a default value for `'BOT_NAME'` or by creating a proper settings object with required values.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def __init__(self, settings):
    default_settings = get_project_settings()
    default_settings.update(settings)
    super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(default_settings)
    install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
    configure_logging(default_settings)
    log_scrapy_info(default_settings)
```

In this corrected code, we first create a `default_settings` object using `get_project_settings()`. We then update this `default_settings` with the provided `settings` dictionary. Finally, we use the updated `default_settings` to initialize the `CrawlerProcess`, configure logging, and log Scrapy info.
