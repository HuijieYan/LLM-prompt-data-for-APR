The error occurs because the `BOT_NAME` setting is not present in the dictionary passed to the `CrawlerProcess` constructor. The `log_scrapy_info` function attempts to access `settings['BOT_NAME']` causing a KeyError since it is not present in the dictionary.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the required settings are present in the `settings` dictionary before calling the `log_scrapy_info` function.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self, settings):
    super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
    install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
    configure_logging(settings)
    
    # Check if 'BOT_NAME' setting is present, and if not, set a default value
    if 'BOT_NAME' not in settings:
        settings['BOT_NAME'] = 'Scrapy'

    log_scrapy_info(settings)
```

In this corrected code, we check if the 'BOT_NAME' setting is present in the `settings` dictionary. If it is not present, we set a default value of 'Scrapy' for 'BOT_NAME'. This ensures that the required settings are present before calling the `log_scrapy_info` function.
