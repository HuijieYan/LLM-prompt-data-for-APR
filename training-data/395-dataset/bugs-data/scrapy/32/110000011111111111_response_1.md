The error message indicates a KeyError related to 'BOT_NAME' when trying to access it from the settings dictionary, which suggests that the 'BOT_NAME' is not defined in the settings being passed to the CrawlerProcess.

It seems that the issue is with the missing definition of 'BOT_NAME' in the settings being used. The log_scrapy_info function is trying to access 'BOT_NAME' from the settings dictionary, and since it's not present, it's causing a KeyError.

To fix this bug, 'BOT_NAME' needs to be defined in the settings dictionary before it is passed to the CrawlerProcess.

Here's the corrected code for the __init__ method:

```python
def __init__(self, settings):
    super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
    if 'BOT_NAME' not in settings:
        settings['BOT_NAME'] = 'default_bot_name'  # Replace 'default_bot_name' with the actual bot name
    install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
    configure_logging(settings)
    log_scrapy_info(settings)
```

By adding a check for 'BOT_NAME' in the settings and providing a default value if it's not present, the KeyError should be avoided.
