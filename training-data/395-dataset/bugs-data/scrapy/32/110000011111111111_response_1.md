The error message indicates a KeyError in the log_scrapy_info function, specifically related to the 'BOT_NAME' key not being found in the settings dictionary.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the log_scrapy_info(settings) call, where the 'BOT_NAME' key is being accessed without checking if it exists.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the 'BOT_NAME' key is not present in the settings dictionary, which causes a KeyError when trying to access it.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the 'BOT_NAME' key exists in the settings dictionary before accessing it. We can do this by adding a check or providing a default value in case the key is missing.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self, settings):
    super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
    install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
    configure_logging(settings)

    # Check if 'BOT_NAME' key exists in settings, if not, provide a default value
    if 'BOT_NAME' not in settings:
        settings['BOT_NAME'] = 'default_bot_name'  # provide a default value if the key is missing

    log_scrapy_info(settings)
```

By adding a check for the existence of the 'BOT_NAME' key in the settings dictionary and providing a default value if it's missing, we can fix the KeyError issue.
