The potential error in the given function is related to the usage of the `super()` method and the `__init__` constructor. The function is an initializer method (constructor) for a class, but it is missing the class declaration, causing the `self` parameter to be unrecognized.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `__init__` method is not properly defined within a class. It seems like the code is supposed to be part of a class definition for `CrawlerProcess`, but it is missing the class declaration. Additionally, the usage of `super()` is not correct.

To fix this bug, the function should be placed within the class declaration for `CrawlerProcess` and the `super()` method should be called with the correct parameters.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class CrawlerProcess:
    def __init__(self, settings):
        super().__init__()
        install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
        configure_logging(settings)
        log_scrapy_info(settings)
```

In the corrected code:
- The `CrawlerProcess` class has been declared, and the `__init__` method is now properly defined within the class.
- The `super()` method is called without passing `CrawlerProcess` and `settings` as parameters, as they are automatically inherited.

Additionally, the variable `self.settings` should be initialized within the `__init__` method if it is a required attribute of the class.
