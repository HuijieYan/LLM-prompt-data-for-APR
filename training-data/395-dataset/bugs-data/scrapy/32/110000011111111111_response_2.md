The error occurs when the function `log_scrapy_info` is called because it tries to access the 'BOT_NAME' key in the `settings` dictionary, which results in a KeyError because the 'BOT_NAME' key is not present in the `settings` dictionary.

To fix this issue, the 'BOT_NAME' must be provided in the `settings` dictionary when the `CrawlerProcess` is initialized. The 'BOT_NAME' key is a required setting in Scrapy.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def __init__(self, settings):
    settings['BOT_NAME'] = 'my_bot'  # Adding the required 'BOT_NAME' key to the settings
    super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
    install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
    configure_logging(settings)
    log_scrapy_info(settings)
```

By adding the 'BOT_NAME' key to the `settings` dictionary before calling `super().__init__(settings)`, we ensure that the required setting is present, and the `log_scrapy_info` function will not raise a KeyError.
