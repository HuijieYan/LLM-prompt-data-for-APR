The potential error in the provided function is the incorrect use of the `__init__` method, which should be used for initializing the object's attributes. It seems that the intention here is to initialize an instance of `CrawlerProcess` with the provided settings.

The reason for the bug is that the `__init__` method is not being properly overridden and initialized here. The use of `super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)` is not correct for the `__init__` method, as it should be used in a class that inherits from another class. 

To fix the bug, we need to properly define the `__init__` method within the `CrawlerProcess` class to initialize the settings and perform other necessary setup tasks.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
class CrawlerProcess(object):
    def __init__(self, settings):
        self.settings = settings
        install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
        configure_logging(settings)
        log_scrapy_info(settings)
```

In this corrected code, we define the `__init__` method within the `CrawlerProcess` class to properly initialize the settings and perform other necessary setup tasks.
