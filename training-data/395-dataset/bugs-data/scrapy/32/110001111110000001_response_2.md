1. The test case is trying to create an instance of the CrawlerProcess class with a dictionary as an argument, which is expected to be stored in the `settings` attribute of the CrawlerProcess instance.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `log_scrapy_info` function, specifically when it tries to access the 'BOT_NAME' key in the settings dictionary.

3. The error message indicates that the 'BOT_NAME' key is not present in the `settings` dictionary. This could be due to the incorrect initialization of the settings dictionary or missing required keys.

4. To fix the bug, the problematic function needs to ensure that the settings dictionary is properly initialized with all the required keys, including 'BOT_NAME'.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self, settings):
    super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
    install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
    configure_logging(settings)
    if 'BOT_NAME' not in settings:
        settings['BOT_NAME'] = 'scrapybot'  # Default value for 'BOT_NAME'
    log_scrapy_info(settings)
```
