The error occurs in the `log_scrapy_info` function because it tries to access `settings['BOT_NAME']` but the key 'BOT_NAME' is not present in the given settings dictionary.

The potential error location is within the initialization of the `CrawlerProcess` class, particularly in the `__init__` method.

The bug occurs because the `__init__` method of the `CrawlerProcess` class does not correctly initialize the settings object with the provided input. Instead, it should create a `Settings` object from the provided dictionary to ensure that all required settings, including 'BOT_NAME', are present.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the `__init__` method to create a `Settings` object from the input dictionary. This ensures that all required settings are present and allows the `log_scrapy_info` function to access 'BOT_NAME' without raising a KeyError.

Here is the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `CrawlerProcess` class:

```python
# correct __init__ method
def __init__(self, settings):
    if not isinstance(settings, Settings):
        settings = Settings(settings)
    super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
    install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
    configure_logging(settings)
    log_scrapy_info(settings)
```
