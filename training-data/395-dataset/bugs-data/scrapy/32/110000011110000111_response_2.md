The error message indicates that the "KeyError: 'BOT_NAME'" occurred in the `log_scrapy_info` function when trying to access the 'BOT_NAME' key from the settings dictionary passed to the `CrawlerProcess` class. 

The potential error location in the problematic function is the `log_scrapy_info(settings)` line, where it is trying to access the 'BOT_NAME' key from the settings dictionary without first checking if it exists.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the 'BOT_NAME' key is not present in the settings dictionary, leading to a KeyError when the `log_scrapy_info` function tries to access it.

To fix the bug, the `log_scrapy_info` function should first check if the 'BOT_NAME' key exists in the settings dictionary before trying to access it. This can be achieved using the `get` method of the dictionary, which allows providing a default value if the key is not found.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def __init__(self, settings):
    super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
    install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
    configure_logging(settings)
    log_scrapy_info(settings)

def log_scrapy_info(settings):
    bot_name = settings.get('BOT_NAME', 'default_bot_name')
    logger.info("Scrapy %(version)s started (bot: %(bot)s)", {'version': scrapy.__version__, 'bot': bot_name})
```

In this corrected version, the `log_scrapy_info` function now uses the `get` method to retrieve the value for the 'BOT_NAME' key from the settings dictionary. If the key is not found, it will default to 'default_bot_name' to prevent the KeyError from occurring.
