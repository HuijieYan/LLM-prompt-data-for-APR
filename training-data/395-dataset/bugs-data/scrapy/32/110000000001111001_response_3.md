The potential error in the provided code lies in the usage of the `__init__` method. The `__init__` method is typically used as a constructor method for initializing an object, but in this case, it seems to be intended for initializing a CrawlerProcess object with the provided settings. 

The error message "TypeError: descriptor '__init__' requires a 'super' object but received a 'CrawlerProcess'" indicates that the usage of `super` is incorrect, and it is expecting a superclass object as the first argument.

The bug occurs because the `super` function is not being used correctly. In Python, when using the `super` function to call a method from a superclass, it should be done within the context of a class. Additionally, the `self` parameter should be omitted in the `__init__` method because it is implicitly passed when the method is called on an object.

To fix the bug, the `__init__` method should be defined within the class and the call to `super` should include the class name.

Here is the corrected code for the CrawlerProcess class:

```python
class CrawlerProcess:
    def __init__(self, settings):
        super().__init__(settings)
        install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
        configure_logging(settings)
        log_scrapy_info(settings)
```

This code assumes that the `install_shutdown_handlers`, `configure_logging`, and `log_scrapy_info` functions are defined elsewhere in the code.
