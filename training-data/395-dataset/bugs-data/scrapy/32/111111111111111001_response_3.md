The error message indicates that there is a KeyError when trying to access the 'BOT_NAME' key in the settings dictionary. This KeyError occurs in the log_scrapy_info() function, which is called within the __init__() method of the CrawlerProcess class.

The reason behind this error is that the 'BOT_NAME' key is not present in the settings dictionary, causing the KeyError when trying to access it.

To fix this issue, you can ensure that the 'BOT_NAME' key is set in the settings dictionary before calling the log_scrapy_info() function.

Here's the corrected code for the __init__() method of the CrawlerProcess class:

```python
def __init__(self, settings):
    # Initialize the CrawlerRunner superclass with the settings
    super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
    
    # Set the 'BOT_NAME' key in the settings dictionary if it doesn't exist
    if 'BOT_NAME' not in settings:
        settings['BOT_NAME'] = 'ScrapyBot'
    
    # Call the other necessary functions
    install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
    configure_logging(settings)
    log_scrapy_info(settings)
```

In this corrected code, we first ensure that the 'BOT_NAME' key exists in the settings dictionary, and if it doesn't, we set it to a default value ('ScrapyBot'). Then, we proceed with calling the other required functions as before.
