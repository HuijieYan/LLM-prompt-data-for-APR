The potential error location within the problematic function is the incorrect usage of the `__init__` method, which is intended to be a constructor for initializing the object's attributes.

The occurrence of the bug is due to the incorrect syntax used to call the superclass (CrawlerProcess) constructor. The usage of `super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)` is incorrect, as it does not properly initialize the object.

To fix the bug, you can use the following corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected function
def __init__(self, settings):
    super().__init__(settings)
    install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
    configure_logging(self.settings)
    log_scrapy_info(self.settings)
```

In the corrected code:
1. We removed the explicit references to the superclass and instead used `super()` to implicitly reference the superclass.
2. We also used `self.settings` instead of just `settings` when calling the `configure_logging` and `log_scrapy_info` functions, assuming that `settings` attribute is accessible within the class.

By making these changes, the initialization of the `CrawlerProcess` class should work as intended.
