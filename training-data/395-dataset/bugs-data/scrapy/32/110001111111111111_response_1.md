The error occurs in the `log_scrapy_info` function, which tries to access the 'BOT_NAME' key in the settings dictionary. However, the 'BOT_NAME' key is not present in the given 'settings' dictionary, causing a KeyError.

To fix this issue, the 'BOT_NAME' key needs to be added to the settings dictionary before calling the `log_scrapy_info` function.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected function
class CrawlerProcess:
    def __init__(self, settings):
        default_settings = get_project_settings()
        default_settings.update(settings)
        default_settings['BOT_NAME'] = 'Scrapy'
        
        super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(default_settings)
        install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
        configure_logging(default_settings)
        log_scrapy_info(default_settings)
```
