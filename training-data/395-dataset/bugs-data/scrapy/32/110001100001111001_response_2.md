Potential Error Location: The error is likely occurring within the __init__ method of the CrawlerProcess class.

Reasons behind the Bug: The main issue is that there are multiple __init__ methods in the code provided, without any context or indication of which one is the correct one. This can lead to confusion and errors when trying to instantiate the CrawlerProcess class.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: 
1. Rename the extra __init__ methods to something else to avoid confusion and potential clashes.
2. Ensure that the correct __init__ method is being called when instantiating the CrawlerProcess class.

Corrected Code:
```python
def __init__(self, spidercls, settings):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def _signal_shutdown(self, signum, _):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

class CrawlerProcess:
    def __init__(self, settings):
        super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
        install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
        configure_logging(settings)
        log_scrapy_info(settings)
``` 

Please note that the original code provided was incomplete, and the corrected code assumes the presence of a class named `CrawlerProcess` with the given __init__ method. If there are other parts of the code that are missing, they might need to be included as well.
