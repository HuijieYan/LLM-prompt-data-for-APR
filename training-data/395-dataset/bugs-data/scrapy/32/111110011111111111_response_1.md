The error is occurring because the settings dictionary passed to the `CrawlerProcess` class does not contain the required key 'BOT_NAME', which is needed by the `log_scrapy_info` function.

The potential error location within the `CrawlerProcess` class is in the `__init__` method where it calls the `log_scrapy_info` function with the `settings` parameter.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the 'BOT_NAME' key is present in the settings dictionary before passing it to the `log_scrapy_info` function. We can either add a default value for 'BOT_NAME' in the settings or check if 'BOT_NAME' is present and handle the case where it's not.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `CrawlerProcess` class:

```python
class CrawlerProcess(CrawlerRunner):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def __init__(self, settings):
        super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
        if 'BOT_NAME' not in settings:
            settings['BOT_NAME'] = 'scrapybot'  # default value
        install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
        configure_logging(settings)
        log_scrapy_info(settings)
```

With this correction, the `CrawlerProcess` class will handle the case where 'BOT_NAME' is not present in the settings dictionary by adding a default value for it, and the error should be resolved.
