The problem in the buggy code is that the class `CrawlerProcess` has multiple `__init__` methods defined, but the function definition for the constructor is incorrect. It should only have one `__init__` method.

The error is occurring because the `CrawlerProcess` class has conflicting `__init__` methods defined, and this is causing confusion for Python to decide which one to use.

To fix this bug, we need to choose one `__init__` method and remove the others. We should also ensure that the chosen `__init__` method initializes all necessary attributes correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `CrawlerProcess` class:

```python
class CrawlerProcess:
    def __init__(self, settings):
        super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
        install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
        configure_logging(settings)
        log_scrapy_info(settings)
```

In this corrected code:
- We've removed the duplicate `__init__` methods.
- We've retained the `__init__` method that takes `settings` as input.
- The `super()` call is used to invoke the superclass's `__init__` method with the `settings` parameter.
- Other necessary methods like `install_shutdown_handlers`, `configure_logging`, and `log_scrapy_info` are being called as before.
