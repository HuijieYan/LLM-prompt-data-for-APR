The error message indicates that the 'BOT_NAME' key is missing in the settings dictionary. This key is being accessed inside the `log_scrapy_info` function, but it is not present in the provided settings dictionary.

It seems that the `CrawlerProcess` class is not properly initializing the settings object, which is resulting in missing keys. The `_signal_shutdown` method is not being utilized in the `__init__` method.

To fix this issue, the `__init__` method in the `CrawlerProcess` class should properly initialize the settings object, install the shutdown handlers, configure logging, and log the Scrapy info.

Here's the corrected code for the `CrawlerProcess` class:

```python
class CrawlerProcess(CrawlerRunner):
    def __init__(self, settings=None, install_shutdown_handlers=True):
        if settings is None:
            settings = get_project_settings()

        super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)

        if install_shutdown_handlers:
            install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)

        configure_logging(settings)
        log_scrapy_info(settings)
```

In the corrected code:
- The `__init__` method now takes an optional `settings` parameter and an optional `install_shutdown_handlers` parameter. If `settings` is not provided, it defaults to the project settings.
- The initialization of the super class `CrawlerRunner` is passing the `settings` parameter.
- The `install_shutdown_handlers` function is called based on the value of `install_shutdown_handlers`.
- Logging and Scrapy info is configured using the provided or default settings.

This should address the issues related to missing keys in the settings dictionary and provide proper initialization of the `CrawlerProcess` class.
