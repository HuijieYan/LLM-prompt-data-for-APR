The error is occurring in the `log_scrapy_info` function, which is trying to access the 'BOT_NAME' key in the settings dictionary. However, the test case is creating a `CrawlerProcess` object by passing a settings dictionary with only the 'foo' key, and not the 'BOT_NAME' key. This is causing a KeyError when `log_scrapy_info` tries to access 'BOT_NAME'.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the 'BOT_NAME' key is present in the settings dictionary before calling the `log_scrapy_info` function. One way to do this is to add a default value for 'BOT_NAME' if it is missing from the settings.

Here's the corrected code for the `CrawlerProcess` class:

```python
class CrawlerProcess:
    def __init__(self, settings):
        if 'BOT_NAME' not in settings:
            settings['BOT_NAME'] = 'Scrapy'  # Default value
            
        super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
        install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
        configure_logging(settings)
        log_scrapy_info(settings)
```

By adding a default value for 'BOT_NAME' in case it is missing from the settings, we ensure that the `log_scrapy_info` function does not raise a KeyError. This should resolve the issue reported in the test function.
