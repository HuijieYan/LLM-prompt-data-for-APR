The error occurs in the `log_scrapy_info` function called within the `CrawlerProcess` class. The `log_scrapy_info` function tries to access the 'BOT_NAME' key in the `settings` dictionary, which is causing a `KeyError` because the 'BOT_NAME' key is not present in the settings provided when the `CrawlerProcess` is instantiated.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the 'BOT_NAME' key is present in the `settings` dictionary before calling the `log_scrapy_info` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `CrawlerProcess` class:

```python
class CrawlerProcess(CrawlerRunner):
    # ... (other code) ...

    def __init__(self, settings):
        super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)

        # Check if the 'BOT_NAME' key is present in the settings; if not, set a default value
        if 'BOT_NAME' not in settings:
            settings['BOT_NAME'] = 'scrapy'

        install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
        configure_logging(settings)
        log_scrapy_info(settings)
```

In this corrected code, before calling the `log_scrapy_info` function, we ensure that the 'BOT_NAME' key exists in the `settings` dictionary. If it does not exist, we set a default value of 'scrapy'.

This should fix the KeyError issue and allow the `CrawlerProcess` class to work properly.
