The error message indicates a KeyError in the `log_scrapy_info` function, specifically with the key 'BOT_NAME'.

The issue is that the settings being passed to the `CrawlerProcess` class are missing the 'BOT_NAME' key. This means that the settings being passed do not have all the required keys, causing the KeyError when trying to access 'BOT_NAME' in the `log_scrapy_info` function.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the settings being passed to the `CrawlerProcess` class include all the required keys, such as 'BOT_NAME'.

Here's the corrected code for the `CrawlerProcess` class:

```python
class CrawlerProcess(CrawlerRunner):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def __init__(self, settings):
        super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
        install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
        configure_logging(settings)
        log_scrapy_info(self.settings)

    # ... omitted code ...
```

By using `self.settings` in the `log_scrapy_info` function instead of the passed `settings`, we ensure that all required keys are present. Additionally, when creating an instance of `CrawlerProcess`, make sure to pass a `Settings` object that includes all the required keys, including 'BOT_NAME'.

This will ensure that the error does not occur, as all the required settings will be present.
