The error occurs when the `log_scrapy_info` function is trying to access the 'BOT_NAME' key from the settings dictionary, which is not present in the input settings dictionary. This is because the settings dictionary provided to the `CrawlerProcess` class is missing the 'BOT_NAME' key.

To fix this issue, you can either ensure that the 'BOT_NAME' key is present in the input settings dictionary or provide a default value for 'BOT_NAME' if it's not present.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self, settings):
    if 'BOT_NAME' not in settings:
        settings['BOT_NAME'] = 'ScrapyBot'
    super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
    install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
    configure_logging(settings)
    log_scrapy_info(settings)
```

By adding a check to see if 'BOT_NAME' is not present in the settings dictionary and providing a default value if it's missing, the error should be resolved, and the test case should pass.
