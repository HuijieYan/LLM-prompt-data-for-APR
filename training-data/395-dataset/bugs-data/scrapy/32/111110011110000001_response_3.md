The error message indicates a KeyError related to the 'BOT_NAME' key when trying to access it from the settings dictionary. This suggests that the 'BOT_NAME' key is missing from the dictionary, which is causing the error.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `log_scrapy_info(settings)` call. This function is trying to access the 'BOT_NAME' key from the settings dictionary, which is not present.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the 'BOT_NAME' key is not being set in the settings dictionary when it is being passed as a dictionary when instantiating the `CrawlerProcess` class.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to ensure that the 'BOT_NAME' key is set in the settings dictionary when it is passed as a dictionary. This can be achieved by adding a default 'BOT_NAME' value to the settings if it is not already present.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self, settings):
    if 'BOT_NAME' not in settings:
        settings['BOT_NAME'] = 'ScrapyBot'  # Providing a default value for BOT_NAME
    super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
    install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
    configure_logging(settings)
    log_scrapy_info(settings)
```

With this correction, if the 'BOT_NAME' key is not present in the settings dictionary, a default value of 'ScrapyBot' will be assigned to it. This should resolve the KeyError issue when accessing 'BOT_NAME' in the log_scrapy_info function.
