Potential error location: The __init__ function is defined multiple times with the same signature, which is not allowed in Python.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The __init__ function should be defined only once with the correct signature. The current code defines it multiple times with different signatures, which will result in a syntax error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Remove the redundant __init__ functions and define only one __init__ function with the correct signature.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_32/scrapy/crawler.py

class CrawlerProcess:
    def __init__(self, settings, spidercls=None):
        super().__init__(settings)
        install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
        configure_logging(settings)
        log_scrapy_info(settings)
        
    def _signal_shutdown(self, signum, _):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass
```
