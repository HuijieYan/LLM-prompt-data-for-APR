The potential error location is the `configure_logging(settings)` line inside the `__init__` method of the `CrawlerProcess` class.

The error message indicates a `KeyError` for 'BOT_NAME' when trying to access it from the `settings` dictionary. This means that the 'BOT_NAME' key is missing from the `settings` dictionary, which is causing the error.

The bug occurred because the `configure_logging` function is trying to access the 'BOT_NAME' key from the settings dictionary without checking for its existence.

To fix this bug, we can ensure that the 'BOT_NAME' key exists in the settings dictionary before trying to access it. We can add a check to verify the presence of 'BOT_NAME' key before accessing it.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `CrawlerProcess` class:

```python
def __init__(self, settings):
    super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
    install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
    if 'BOT_NAME' in settings:
        configure_logging(settings)
        log_scrapy_info(settings)
    else:
        # handle the case when 'BOT_NAME' is not present in settings
        configure_logging({'BOT_NAME': 'default_bot_name', **settings})
        log_scrapy_info({'BOT_NAME': 'default_bot_name', **settings})
```

This correction ensures that if 'BOT_NAME' is present in the settings, it will be used for logging and scrapy info, and if it's missing, a default value will be used to prevent the KeyError.
