The error message indicates that the 'BOT_NAME' key is missing in the 'settings' dictionary, which causes the 'KeyError' when trying to access it in the 'log_scrapy_info' function. This suggests that the 'settings' dictionary passed to the 'CrawlerProcess' class does not contain the necessary keys/values.

The potential error location within the 'CrawlerProcess' class is the __init__ method. It seems that the settings being passed to the class are incomplete.

The bug occurs because the 'settings' dictionary passed to the 'CrawlerProcess' class does not contain all the necessary keys, specifically the 'BOT_NAME' key.

To fix this bug, the 'settings' dictionary should be populated with the required settings, including the 'BOT_NAME' key. One possible approach is to ensure that the 'settings' dictionary contains the default settings along with any additional custom settings when initializing the 'CrawlerProcess' class.

Here's the corrected code for the 'CrawlerProcess' class:

```python
class CrawlerProcess(CrawlerRunner):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def __init__(self, settings):
        complete_settings = get_project_settings()
        complete_settings.update(settings)
        super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(complete_settings)
        install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
        configure_logging(complete_settings)
        log_scrapy_info(complete_settings)
```

In this corrected code, we first obtain the complete default settings using the 'get_project_settings()' function and then update it with any custom settings passed to the 'CrawlerProcess' class. This ensures that the 'settings' dictionary contains all the necessary keys, including 'BOT_NAME', and prevents the 'KeyError' issue described in the error message.
