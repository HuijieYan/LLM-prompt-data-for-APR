The error message "KeyError: 'BOT_NAME'" indicates that the 'BOT_NAME' key is missing from the 'settings' dictionary. This error occurs when the 'log_scrapy_info' function tries to access 'settings['BOT_NAME']' but the key 'BOT_NAME' is not present in the input 'settings' dictionary.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the 'log_scrapy_info(settings)' function call. There is a missing key in the 'settings' dictionary which causes the KeyError.

To fix this bug, we should ensure that the 'settings' dictionary passed to the 'CrawlerProcess' class includes the necessary keys. This can be achieved by modifying the input 'settings' dictionary to include the required keys, such as 'BOT_NAME'.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self, settings):
    super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
    default_settings = get_project_settings()
    settings.setdict(default_settings, priority='default')
    install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
    configure_logging(settings)
    log_scrapy_info(settings)
```

In this corrected code, we are using the 'default_settings' to provide a default set of settings. Then, we update the input 'settings' dictionary with the default settings. This ensures that all required keys are present in the 'settings' dictionary and prevents the KeyError from occurring.
