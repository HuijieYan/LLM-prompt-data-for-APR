Potential error location: The error occurs at the `log_scrapy_info(settings)` function call inside the `__init__` method of the `CrawlerProcess` class.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `log_scrapy_info` function is trying to access the `'BOT_NAME'` key in the `settings` dictionary, which is not present. This is causing a `KeyError`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the `settings` dictionary passed to the `CrawlerProcess` class contains the `'BOT_NAME'` key.
2. Handle the scenario where the `'BOT_NAME'` key is not present in the `settings` dictionary by providing a default value or handling the `KeyError` exception.

```python
# corrected function
def __init__(self, settings):
        super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
        install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
        configure_logging(settings)
        if 'BOT_NAME' not in settings:
            settings['BOT_NAME'] = 'default_bot_name'  # provide a default value
        log_scrapy_info(settings)
```
