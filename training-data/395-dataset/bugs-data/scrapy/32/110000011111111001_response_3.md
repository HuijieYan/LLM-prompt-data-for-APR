The error message indicates a KeyError on the line `{'version': scrapy.__version__, 'bot': settings['BOT_NAME']}` inside the `log_scrapy_info` function. This suggests that the `settings` dictionary does not have a key called `'BOT_NAME'`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `log_scrapy_info(settings)` line. It seems that the `settings` dictionary provided as an argument to the function does not contain all the required keys, including `'BOT_NAME'`.

The buggy function `__init__` is not properly initializing the `settings` attribute, which is causing the KeyError in the `log_scrapy_info` function.

To fix the bug, the `__init__` function should properly initialize the `settings` attribute with the provided settings, and ensure that it contains all the necessary keys. This can be achieved by using the `Settings` class from Scrapy.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def __init__(self, settings):
    self.settings = Settings(settings)
    super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(self.settings)
    install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
    configure_logging(self.settings)
    log_scrapy_info(self.settings)
``` 

In this corrected function, the `settings` attribute is initialized using the `Settings` class, which ensures that it contains all the necessary keys. This should resolve the KeyError issue in the `log_scrapy_info` function.
