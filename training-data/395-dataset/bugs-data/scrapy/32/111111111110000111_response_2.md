Based on the error message, it seems that the settings dictionary passed to the `CrawlerProcess` does not contain the 'BOT_NAME' key, which is required by the `log_scrapy_info` function.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `log_scrapy_info(settings)` call, which tries to access 'BOT_NAME' from the settings dictionary without checking if the key exists.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the settings dictionary passed to the `CrawlerProcess` is missing the 'BOT_NAME' key, which is a required setting for logging.

To fix the bug, an approach could be to ensure that the 'BOT_NAME' key exists in the settings dictionary before calling the `log_scrapy_info` function. If it doesn't exist, it should be provided with a default value.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self, settings):
    super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
    install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
    configure_logging(settings)
    if 'BOT_NAME' not in settings:
        settings['BOT_NAME'] = 'Scrapy'
    log_scrapy_info(settings)
```

In this corrected code, before calling the `log_scrapy_info` function, it checks if the 'BOT_NAME' key exists in the settings dictionary. If it doesn't, it assigns a default value of 'Scrapy' to the 'BOT_NAME' key. This ensures that the `log_scrapy_info` function will always have the required 'BOT_NAME' key in the settings dictionary.
