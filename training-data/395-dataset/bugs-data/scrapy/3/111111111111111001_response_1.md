The test case test_redirect_302_relative is checking whether a request is correctly modified after processing a response with a status code of 302. 

The error message indicates that the URL after the processing is incorrect. It should be 'http://i8n.example2.com/302' but the actual URL is 'http://www.example.com/i8n.example2.com/302'. This suggests that there is an issue with constructing the redirected URL.

The issue occurs in the logic where the redirected URL is being computed. The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of the urljoin function when constructing the redirected URL. The existing code does not handle relative URLs correctly.

To fix the bug, the urljoin function should be used to construct the redirected URL properly so that relative URLs are resolved correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import posixpath

def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = safe_url_string(response.headers['location'])

    redirected_url = response.urljoin(location)  # Use response.urljoin to handle relative URLs correctly

    if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
``` 

With this correction, the urljoin function of the response object is used to handle the redirection URL ensuring that relative URLs are resolved correctly.
