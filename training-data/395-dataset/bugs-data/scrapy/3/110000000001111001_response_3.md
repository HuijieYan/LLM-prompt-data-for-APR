The potential error in the given function is that it incorrectly processes the redirected URL when the response status is within the allowed status range. The bug occurs as the function does not handle concatenation of the request URL and the location correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the redirected URL is created by joining the request URL and the location using the urljoin() function instead of concatenation. Additionally, the safe_url_string() function needs to be replaced with appropriate logic to handle the location.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = response.headers['location'].decode('utf-8')  # assuming the location is in utf-8 format, decoding to string

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

In this corrected code, we address the issue by decoding the location from the response headers and using urljoin() to correctly create the redirected URL. The value types of variables are unchanged, as they maintain their original types.
