The error message and the associated detailed issue description indicate that when a 302 response returns a header's location that starts with three slashes, the Scrapy redirect to a URL different from what the browser does. This indicates that the bug lies in the redirection logic when the location starts with three slashes.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the `Location` header and the redirection logic based on the response status.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the Scrapy redirection logic does not handle cases where the location starts with three slashes properly, leading to incorrect redirection.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the logic to handle cases where the location starts with three slashes and perform the redirection accordingly.
2. Ensure that the redirection logic aligns with the behavior of popular browsers like Chrome to achieve consistent redirection behavior.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from w3lib.url import safe_url_string

# class declaration containing the fixed function
class RedirectMiddleware(BaseRedirectMiddleware):
    """
    Handle redirection of requests based on response status
    and meta-refresh html tag.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
                response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
            return response

        allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
        if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
            return response

        location = safe_url_string(response.headers['location'])

        redirected_url = location if location.startswith('http') else urljoin(request.url, location)

        if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```
