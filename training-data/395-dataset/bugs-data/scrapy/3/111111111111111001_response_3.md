The test case `test_redirect_302_relative` is checking if the `process_response` function of the `RedirectMiddleware` correctly handles the redirection based on the response headers. It makes assertions based on the expected redirected URL.

The error message indicates that the actual redirected URL (`http://www.example.com/i8n.example2.com/302`) does not match the expected redirected URL (`http://i8n.example2.com/302`).

The potential error location within the `process_response` function is in the calculation of the `redirected_url`, which is formed by joining the request URL and the location from the response headers.

The bug occurs because the location URL is being prefixed with `///` which should not be there and leads to the incorrect construction of the `redirected_url`.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary `///` from the location URL before joining it with the request URL to form `redirected_url`.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` function:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
                response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
            return response

        allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
        if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
            return response

        location = safe_url_string(response.headers['location'])

        # Remove the unnecessary '///' prefix from the location URL
        location = location.lstrip('/')

        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

        if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
``` 

With this correction, the `process_response` function will correctly handle the redirection and provide the expected redirected URL, resolving the bug identified in the test.
