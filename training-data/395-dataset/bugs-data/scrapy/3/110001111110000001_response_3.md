The test case 'test_redirect_302_relative' checks the response of a request with status code 302 and a 'Location' header. It compares the URL of the new request with the expected URL. The issue arises because the URL created by the function process_response is incorrect.

The potential error location within the process_response function is the construction of the 'redirected_url' using 'urljoin(request.url, location)'.

The bug occurs because the 'urljoin' method doesn't handle the scenario where the 'location' may already be an absolute URL. This leads to the concatenation of the base URL with the absolute 'location' URL, resulting in an invalid URL.

To fix the bug, we can check if the 'location' is an absolute URL. If it is, we can simply use that as the 'redirected_url'. If it's a relative URL, then we can join it with the base URL.

Here's the corrected code for the process_response function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

class YourMiddlewareClass:
    # ... other functions ...

    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        # existing code

        location = safe_url_string(response.headers['location'])

        if not location.startswith(('http://', 'https://')):
            location = urljoin(request.url, location)

        redirected = request.replace(url=location)

        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

This code first checks if the 'location' is already an absolute URL. If it is, then it directly uses it as the 'redirected_url'. If it's a relative URL, then it joins it with the base URL and proceeds with the redirection logic.
