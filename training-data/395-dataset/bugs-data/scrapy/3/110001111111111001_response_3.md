The error occurs in the `test_redirect_302_relative` test case where the expected URL for the request (`req2.url`) is `'http://i8n.example2.com/302'`, but the actual URL is `'http://www.example.com/i8n.example2.com/302'`.

The bug is located in the line:
```python
redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
```
The bug occurs because the `urljoin` function is not used correctly, resulting in the construction of a wrong URL.

The bug occurs because the `urljoin` function should be used to construct the `redirected_url` by joining the `request.url` and `location`. However, in the current code, it directly replaces the URL in the `request` object, which does not account for relative URLs.

The bug can be fixed by using the `urljoin` function correctly to construct the `redirected_url` and create a new `Request` object using the `url` parameter.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

# ...

def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    # ... (previous code)

    location = safe_url_string(response.headers['location'])

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        new_request = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(new_request, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

By using `urljoin` to construct the `redirected_url` and creating a new `Request` object using the `url` parameter, the bug is fixed and the test case should pass successfully.
