The potential error in the `process_response` function is that the function is trying to call the `_redirect` and `_redirect_request_using_get` methods directly from `self`, which is not defined in the given code. This will result in an AttributeError.

The reason for the bug is that the code is trying to call methods using `self`, but `self` is not defined within the `process_response` function. Additionally, the methods being called are not defined in the given code snippet.

To fix this bug, the function should be updated to call the `_redirect` and `_redirect_request_using_get` methods using `spider` object instead of `self`. Additionally, the methods `_redirect` and `_redirect_request_using_get` need to be defined.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = safe_url_string(response.headers['location'])

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return spider._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = spider._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return spider._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```
