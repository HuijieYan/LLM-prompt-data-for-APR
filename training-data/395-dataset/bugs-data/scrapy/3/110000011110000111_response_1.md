The test case `test_redirect_302_relative` is failing because the expected redirected URL is `http://i8n.example2.com/302`, but the actual redirected URL is `http://www.example.com/i8n.example2.com/302`. This discrepancy indicates that there is an issue with how the `Location` header is being processed and the URL is being redirected.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the handling of the `Location` header and the URL redirection logic.

The issue is occurring because the `Location` header in the response has a value that starts with three slashes (`///`), and the logic to handle this kind of URL redirection is not implemented correctly in the `process_response` function.

To fix the bug, the handling of the `Location` header and the URL redirection logic needs to be updated to correctly process URLs that start with three slashes.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (
        request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False)
        or response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])
        or response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', [])
        or request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)
    ):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = response.headers['location']
    if location.startswith('///'):
        location = location.lstrip('/')

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

With these changes, the function will correctly handle URLs that start with three slashes in the `Location` header. This should resolve the issue mentioned in the test case and the associated GitHub issue.
