The test case `test_redirect_302_relative` is testing the functionality of the `process_response` method of the `RedirectMiddleware` class. The error message indicates that the `url3` is not matching the actual result of the `process_response` method.

The potential error location within the `process_response` method is in the calculation of the `redirected_url` and the subsequent creation of the `redirected` request. It seems that the `urljoin` function is not working as intended.

The bug is occurring because the `urljoin` function is joining the `request.url` with the `Location` header without properly handling the case when the `Location` header is a relative URL. This is causing the incorrect URL to be formed.

To fix this bug, you can modify the code to handle the relative URLs in the `Location` header properly. You can check if the `Location` is a relative URL and then join it with the base URL appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` method:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = safe_url_string(response.headers['location'])

    base_url = urlparse(request.url)
    if location.startswith('/'):
        redirected_url = base_url.scheme + '://' + base_url.netloc + location
    else:
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

With this corrected code, the `urljoin` function is now used in a way that properly handles relative URLs, and the bug should be fixed.
