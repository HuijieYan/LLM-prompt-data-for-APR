The issue with the buggy function is that it doesn't handle the response headers correctly when constructing the redirected URL. The `location` variable is being assigned the value of `safe_url_string(response.headers['location'])`, which is not the correct way to extract the location from the headers.

The bug occurs because the `response.headers['location']` is being used as a key directly, resulting in an incorrect retrieval of the value. Additionally, the `urljoin` function is not being used to construct the redirected URL properly.

To fix the bug, you should use the `get` method to safely retrieve the 'Location' header from the response headers. Then, use the `urljoin` function to construct the redirected URL.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` function:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response
    
    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response
    
    location = response.headers.get('Location').decode('utf-8')
    
    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)
    
    if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
    
    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

With these changes, the `Location` header is correctly retrieved, and the redirected URL is constructed using `urljoin` to ensure the correct formation of the URL.
