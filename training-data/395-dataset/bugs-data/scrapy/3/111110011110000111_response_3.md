The error occurs in the `test_redirect_302_relative` test case where it compares the expected redirected URL (`url3`) with the actual redirected URL (`req2.url`). The assertion fails because the actual URL is formed incorrectly.

The issue is likely occurring in the `process_response` function of the `RedirectMiddleware` class, specifically in the handling of relative URLs. When the header's location starts with three slashes (`///`), the current implementation does not handle it correctly. This leads to the creation of an incorrect redirected URL.

To fix this bug, the `process_response` function needs to handle the case where the location header starts with three slashes and properly construct the redirected URL.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

class RedirectMiddleware(BaseRedirectMiddleware):
    """
    Handle redirection of requests based on response status
    and meta-refresh html tag.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
                response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
            return response

        allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
        if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
            return response

        location = safe_url_string(response.headers['location'])

        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

        if redirected_url.startswith('///'):
            # Handle case where location header starts with three slashes
            redirected_url = redirected_url[2:]  # Remove the extra slash
            if not redirected_url.startswith('http'):
                redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, redirected_url)

        if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

With this correction, the `process_response` function will properly handle the case where the location header starts with three slashes and construct the redirected URL accordingly. This should resolve the issue described in the GitHub report.
