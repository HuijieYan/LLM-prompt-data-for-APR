The error message states that the expected URL after the redirect is 'http://i8n.example2.com/302', but the actual URL is 'http://www.example.com/i8n.example2.com/302'. This indicates that the URL redirection is not working as expected when the Location header starts with '///'.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the 'Location' header in the 'process_response' method. It seems that the issue lies in how the 'Location' header value is used to generate the redirected URL.

The bug occurs because the 'Location' header value retrieved from the response is not being handled correctly when it starts with '///'. This leads to incorrect URL concatenation in the 'redirected_url' variable, resulting in a faulty redirect.

To fix the bug, the 'redirected_url' variable should be constructed so that it correctly combines the base URL from the request and the Location header value from the response, handling cases where the 'Location' header value starts with '///'.

Here's the corrected code for the 'process_response' method:

```python
from w3lib.url import safe_url_string
from urllib.parse import urljoin

class RedirectMiddleware:
    # other methods...

    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
                response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
            return response

        allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
        if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
            return response

        location = safe_url_string(response.headers['location'])
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)  # Correct URL concatenation

        if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

With the corrected code, the 'redirected_url' is constructed using the 'urljoin' function, which handles cases where the 'Location' header value starts with '///', ensuring that the URL redirection works as expected.
