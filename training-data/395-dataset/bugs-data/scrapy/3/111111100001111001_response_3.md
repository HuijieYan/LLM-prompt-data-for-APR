The bug is likely occurring because when the `Location` header is present in the response, the `redirected_url` is not formed correctly. It seems there is a URL joining issue that causes `redirected_url` to have an incorrect value.

To fix the bug, we need to use the `urlparse` and `urlunparse` functions from the `urllib.parse` module to handle the URL parsing and joining.

Below is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
import urllib.parse

# ... other code ...

class RedirectMiddleware(BaseRedirectMiddleware):
    """
    Handle redirection of requests based on response status and meta-refresh html tag.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
                response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
            return response

        allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
        if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
            return response

        location = safe_url_string(response.headers['Location'].decode())
        redirected_url = urllib.parse.urljoin(request.url, location)

        if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
``` 

In the corrected code:
1. We are using `urllib.parse.urljoin` to correctly join the `request.url` and the `location` from the response headers to get the `redirected_url`.
2. We are decoding the value of the `Location` header to string using `.decode()` as it was mentioned as `b'Location': [b'///i8n.example2.com/302']` in the input case 1.
3. We are handling the URL parsing and joining using the `urllib.parse` module to ensure the `redirected_url` is formed correctly.

With these changes, the `redirected_url` should be formed correctly, and the bug should be fixed.
