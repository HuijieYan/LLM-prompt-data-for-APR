Based on the provided GitHub issue, the problem seems to be with the way Scrapy handles 302 redirection when the headers location starts with three slashes ("///"). This results in Scrapy redirecting to a different URL than what the browser does.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `process_response` method of the `RedirectMiddleware` class. Specifically, the issue might be in the line that handles the redirection when the response status is 301, 307, or 308.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that Scrapy does not handle the case where the `Location` header starts with three slashes according to the RFC specification.

To fix the bug, one possible approach is to modify the logic for handling redirection when the response status is 301, 307, or 308. Specifically, when constructing the `redirected_url`, it should handle the case where the `Location` header starts with three slashes. Additionally, the `_redirect_request_using_get` method might need modifications to handle such URLs appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` method:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = safe_url_string(response.headers['location'])

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)
    
    if location.startswith('///'):
        location = location[2:]  # Remove the extra slashes
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

In the corrected code, we check if the `Location` header starts with three slashes, and if so, we remove the extra slashes before constructing the `redirected_url`. This should address the issue described in the GitHub issue by handling the redirection correctly when the `Location` header starts with three slashes.
