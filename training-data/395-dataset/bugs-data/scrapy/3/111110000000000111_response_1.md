Potential error location: The error seems to be related to the handling of the 'Location' header in the process_response method of the RedirectMiddleware class. When the response status is 302 and the 'Location' header starts with three slashes, the redirection does not behave as expected.

Reason behind the bug: The bug may be occurring due to the incorrect handling of the 'Location' header when it starts with three slashes. This leads to the incorrect redirection of the URL.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the logic for handling the 'Location' header in the process_response method to ensure that it correctly handles cases where the 'Location' starts with three slashes.
2. Validate the URL concatenation process to ensure that the final redirected URL is formed correctly.

Corrected code:
```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

class RedirectMiddleware(BaseRedirectMiddleware):
    """
    Handle redirection of requests based on response status
    and meta-refresh html tag.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
                response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
            return response
    
        if response.status in (301, 302, 303, 307, 308):
            location = response.headers.get('Location')
            if location.startswith('///'):
                location = location[2:]  # remove the extra slash
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)
    
            if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
                redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
                return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
    
            redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
        return response
```
