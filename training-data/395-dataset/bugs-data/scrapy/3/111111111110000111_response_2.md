Analyzing the test case and the error message, it seems that the issue is with the redirecting functionality of the `process_response` method in the `RedirectMiddleware` class. The provided test case is expecting the redirection to be from `http://www.example.com/302` to `http://i8n.example2.com/302`. However, the actual behavior is redirecting to `http://www.example.com/i8n.example2.com/302`.

The potential error location within the `process_response` method is the handling of the `redirected_url` and the redirection logic based on the response status.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that when the `Location` header starts with three slashes (`///`), the `redirected_url` is not parsed correctly, resulting in the incorrect redirection.

To fix the bug, the `redirected_url` needs to be parsed correctly, and the redirection logic needs to be adjusted to handle the `Location` header appropriately for the cases where the redirection URL starts with three slashes.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` method:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

class RedirectMiddleware(BaseRedirectMiddleware):
    """
    Handle redirection of requests based on response status
    and meta-refresh html tag.
    """
    
    # ... omitted code ...

    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
                response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
            return response
        
        if 'Location' not in response.headers:
            return response

        location = response.headers['location']
        
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

In the corrected code, we use the `urljoin` function to properly compute the `redirected_url` by joining the base URL (original request URL) with the location from the `Location` header. Then, we create a new request (`redirected`) with the updated URL, and the `_redirect` method is called to handle the redirection.

With this change, the bug related to redirection when the `Location` header starts with three slashes should be resolved.
