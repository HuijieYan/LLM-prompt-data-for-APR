The error message indicates that when the response header's location starts with three slashes (///), the scrapy library redirects to a different URL compared to what a browser does. This behavior is unexpected and leads to incorrect redirection.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the handling of the `redirected_url` when it starts with three slashes.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code does not properly handle the case when the `redirected_url` starts with three slashes. This leads to incorrect redirection.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the `redirected_url` starts with three slashes and handle this case separately to ensure correct redirection.
2. Use the `urlparse` library to properly parse and handle the `redirected_url` in a way that aligns with standard URL resolution.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urlunparse, urljoin

class RedirectMiddleware(object):
    # ... (other functions)

    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
                response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
            return response

        allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
        if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
            return response

        location = safe_url_string(response.headers['location'])

        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

        if redirected_url.startswith('///'):
            parsed_url = urlparse(request.url)
            redirected_url = urlunparse((parsed_url.scheme, parsed_url.netloc, redirected_url.lstrip('/'), '', '', ''))

        if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

In the corrected code, we use the `urlparse` library to properly handle the `redirected_url` when it starts with three slashes. We parse the original request URL, combine it with the location, and then construct a valid URL using `urlunparse`. This ensures that the redirection behaves consistently with browser behavior.
