The test case 'test_redirect_302_relative' is failing because the 'process_response' method in the provided code is not handling the case where the 'Location' header starts with '///' correctly. As a result, the redirected URL is constructed incorrectly, leading to the failure of the test case.

The bug occurs because the original implementation does not handle the case when the 'Location' header starts with '///' correctly. This leads to the incorrect construction of the redirected URL, resulting in a failed test case.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for constructing the redirected URL when the 'Location' header starts with '///'. We will need to handle this situation separately to ensure that the redirected URL is constructed accurately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function 'process_response':

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

class YourMiddlewareClass:
    # other methods...

    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
                response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
            return response

        allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
        if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
            return response

        location = safe_url_string(response.headers['location'])

        if location.startswith('///'):
            # Handle the case where 'Location' header starts with '///'
            location = location[2:]  # Remove the extra slashes

        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

        if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

With this corrected code, the 'Location' header starting with '///' will be handled separately to ensure the correct construction of the redirected URL. This should resolve the redirection issue described in the test case and the associated GitHub issue.
