The test case `test_redirect_302_relative` checks the behavior of the `process_response` method of the `RedirectMiddleware` class when the response code is 302 and a relative URL is provided in the `Location` header of the response.

The specific error that the test encounters is that the expected redirected URL (`url3`) is `'http://i8n.example2.com/302'`, while the actual redirected URL obtained from calling `self.mw.process_response` is `'http://www.example.com/i8n.example2.com/302'`.

The potential error location within the `process_response` method is likely the construction of the `redirected_url` variable, which seems to be combining the request URL with the location provided in the response headers incorrectly.

The reason behind this bug could be related to the construction of the `redirected_url` variable, where `urljoin(request.url, location)` is used. It seems like the relative URL is not being properly resolved against the base URL.

To fix the bug, the `urljoin` function should be used to correctly resolve the relative URL against the base URL. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the relative URL in the `Location` header is properly formatted.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` method:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin, urlparse

class RedirectMiddleware(BaseRedirectMiddleware):
    # ... other methods ...

    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
                response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
            return response

        allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
        if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
            return response

        location = response.headers.get('Location').decode('utf-8')  # Decode the Location header

        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

        if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

With these changes, the `urljoin` function is used to correctly resolve the relative URL in the `Location` header, and the `redirected_url` should now have the expected value.
