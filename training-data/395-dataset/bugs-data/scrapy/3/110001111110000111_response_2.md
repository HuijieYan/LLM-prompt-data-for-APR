The error message from the test function indicates that the redirection is not happening as expected. The expected redirected URL is 'http://i8n.example2.com/302', but the actual redirected URL is 'http://www.example.com/i8n.example2.com/302', which is incorrect.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the computation of the redirected URL. This computation occurs when the 'Location' header is present in the response and the response status is in the allowed_status (301, 302, 303, 307, 308).

The bug occurs because the redirection logic is incorrectly handling the case where the 'Location' header of the response starts with three slashes ('///'). This causes the incorrect formation of the redirected URL.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the computation of the redirected URL to handle the case where the 'Location' header starts with three slashes. The corrected logic should properly handle the construction of the redirected URL.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

class YourMiddlewareClass:
    # other methods...

    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False):
            return response

        allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
        if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
            return response

        location = response.headers['Location'].decode('utf-8')
        if location.startswith('///'):
            location = 'http://' + location.lstrip('/')

        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

        if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

The updated code includes a check for the 'Location' header starting with three slashes and adjusts the `location` variable accordingly. This ensures that the redirected URL is correctly constructed, fixing the issue with redirection.
