The error occurs when the response status is 302 and the headers location starts with '///'. This causes the redirection URL to be different from what is expected. The bug is likely located in the section of the code that constructs the redirected URL using the response headers.

One approach to fixing the bug is to check for the case where the 'Location' header starts with '///' and handle it appropriately to construct the correct redirected URL. This can be achieved by replacing '///' with the appropriate scheme in the URL before constructing the redirected URL.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = safe_url_string(response.headers['location'])

    # Handle the case where 'Location' starts with '///'
    if location.startswith('///'):
        # Get the scheme from the request URL
        request_scheme = urlparse(request.url).scheme
        location = request_scheme + ':' + location

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

With this corrected code, the bug should be fixed, and the function should properly handle the case where the 'Location' header starts with '///' when constructing the redirected URL.
