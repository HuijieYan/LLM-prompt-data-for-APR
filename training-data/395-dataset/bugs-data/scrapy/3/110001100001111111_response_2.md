The test case involves a 302 redirection response with a headers location that starts with three slashes. The expected behavior is to redirect to a specific URL, but the actual behavior is redirecting to a different URL.

The potential error location is in the code that processes the response and handles redirections. Specifically, the line of code that constructs the `redirected_url` using `urljoin(request.url, location)` may be the source of the issue.

The bug occurs because the location URL in the response headers starts with three slashes, which is not a valid URL. This causes the URL to be constructed incorrectly and leads to the incorrect redirection behavior.

To fix the bug, the code should handle scenarios where the location URL starts with three slashes. This can be done by checking if the location URL starts with three slashes and then handling it accordingly to construct the correct redirected URL.

Additionally, it would be beneficial to take into account the differences in behavior between Scrapy and web browsers when handling URLs that start with three slashes.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = safe_url_string(response.headers['location'])

    if location.startswith('///'):
        location = location.lstrip('/')

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

In the corrected code, there is an additional check for the location URL starting with three slashes. If it does start with three slashes, it is modified to remove the extra slashes before constructing the `redirected_url`. This fix addresses the issue of incorrect redirection behavior when the location URL starts with three slashes.
