Analyzing the issue and the error message, it seems that the problem lies within the `process_response` method of the `RedirectMiddleware` class. The issue occurs when the `Location` header in the response starts with three slashes (`///`), causing the redirection to a different URL than expected.

The reason behind the bug is that the `process_response` method does not handle the case where the `Location` header starts with three slashes, leading to an incorrect URL redirection.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `process_response` method to handle the scenario where the `Location` header starts with three slashes. We can achieve this by properly handling the `redirected_url` when it starts with three slashes.

Here is the corrected code for the `process_response` method:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', false)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = safe_url_string(response.headers['location'])

    # Fix for handling the scenario with three slashes in the location
    if location.startswith('///'):
        location = location[2:]  # Remove the extra slashes

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

In this corrected code, we check if the `location` starts with three slashes, and if so, we remove the extra slashes before constructing the `redirected_url`. This modification should ensure that the URL redirection works as expected even when the `Location` header starts with three slashes.
