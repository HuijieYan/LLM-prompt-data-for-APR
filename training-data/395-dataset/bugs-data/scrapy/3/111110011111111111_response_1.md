The bug seems to be occurring in the way the `redirected_url` is being generated in the `process_response` function. When the provided `location` starts with three slashes (`///`), it seems to be joined with the `request.url` without any further processing, which leads to an incorrect URL.

To fix this issue, we need to handle the case where the `location` starts with three slashes and properly join it with the `request.url` to generate the `redirected_url`.

The corrected code for the `process_response` function is as follows:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

class RedirectMiddleware(BaseRedirectMiddleware):
    # ... other omitted code ...

    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
                response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
            return response

        allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
        if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
            return response

        location = safe_url_string(response.headers['location'])
        
        if location.startswith('///'):
            location = location[2:]  # Removing the extra slashes

        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

        if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

This correction handles the case where the `location` starts with three slashes by removing the extra slashes before joining it with the `request.url` to generate the `redirected_url`.

The corrected code should address the issue described in the test case and the associated GitHub issue.
