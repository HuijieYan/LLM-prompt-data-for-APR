Potential Error Location:
The error could potentially be located in the condition for checking if the 'Location' is in the response headers and if the response status is in the allowed status codes.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug could be due to incorrect logic in checking for the 'Location' in the response headers and validating the response status against the allowed status codes. There could also be an issue with the safe_url_string and urljoin functions.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the 'Location' header exists in the response headers before accessing it.
2. Verify if the response status is one of the allowed status codes.
3. Ensure that the safe_url_string and urljoin functions are functioning correctly.

Corrected Code:
```python
from w3lib.url import safe_url_string
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response
        
    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = safe_url_string(response.headers.get('location'))

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```
