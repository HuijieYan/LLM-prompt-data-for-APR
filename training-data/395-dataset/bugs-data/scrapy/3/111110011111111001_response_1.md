The bug seems to be related to the incorrect concatenation of the URLs in the `process_response` function of the RedirectMiddleware class. The bug is causing the final URL to be incorrect, leading to the assertion error in the test case.

The bug occurs because the value of `location` is being incorrectly parsed due to the way the URL is joined. Also, the `redirected_url` is not getting concatenated properly.

To fix this bug:
1. Use the `urlparse` method to parse the `location` and properly join the URLs.
2. Concatenate the parsed `location` with the base URL using the `urljoin` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urljoin

class RedirectMiddleware(BaseRedirectMiddleware):
    """
    Handle redirection of requests based on response status
    and meta-refresh html tag.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
                response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
            return response
    
        allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
        if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
            return response
    
        location = safe_url_string(response.headers['location'])
    
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)
    
        if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
    
        redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

With these corrections, the `process_response` function should now properly handle and concatenate the URLs, resolving the bug and passing the test case successfully.
