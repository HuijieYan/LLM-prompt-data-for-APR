The test case "test_redirect_302_relative" is failing with an assertion error because the redirected URL is not as expected. The bug occurs because of the way the Location header is handled in the "process_response" method.

The bug is likely to be in the section of the code that handles the redirection logic based on the Location header. Since the test case is about processing a 302 response with a relative URL in the Location header, the bug is likely to be in the logic that constructs the redirected URL.

To fix the bug, the "Location" header in the response needs to be parsed and then joined with the original request URL to construct the full redirected URL. This process may involve handling relative URLs properly and ensuring that the redirection is in line with the behavior observed in web browsers.

Here's the corrected code for the "process_response" method:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = response.headers.get('Location').decode('utf-8')

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

With this correction, the code properly handles the Location header in the response, constructs the redirected URL, and performs the redirection in accordance with the expected behavior. This should resolve the redirection issue observed in the test case and reported in the GitHub issue.
