The test case is testing the behavior of the `_redirect_request_using_get` method but is encountering an error due to the incorrect behavior of the `process_response` method. The error message indicates that the URL is being incorrectly modified, which suggests that the bug might be located in the URL manipulation part of the code.

The bug is occurring because the `redirected_url` is being incorrectly appended to the original URL without proper validation. This is resulting in a malformed URL.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `redirected_url` is properly appended to the original URL using the `urljoin` method. Additionally, we need to handle cases where the `redirected_url` is already an absolute URL. 

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` method:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = safe_url_string(response.headers['location'])

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    return request.replace(url=redirected_url, method='GET')
```

With this correction, the `redirected_url` is properly joined with the original URL and then used to create a new request without modifying the original URL. This should resolve the bug encountered in the test case.
