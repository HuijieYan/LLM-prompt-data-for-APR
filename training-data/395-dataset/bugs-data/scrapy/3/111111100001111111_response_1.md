The issue arises because the `location` variable is being set to `safe_url_string(response.headers['location'])`, which seems to trim triple slashes to a single slash. This is causing the redirected URL to be malformed.

To fix this issue, the `_redirect_request_using_get` method should be used to handle the redirection when the response status is not in (301, 307, 308) and the request method is not 'HEAD'. This method should construct and return a new request with an updated URL.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` method:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = response.headers.get('location').decode('utf-8')  # Decode bytes to string
    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

By decoding the 'location' header from bytes to a string and using the `_redirect_request_using_get` method to construct the redirected request, we can fix the issue related to the malformed redirected URL.
