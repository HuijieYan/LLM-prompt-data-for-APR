The potential error in the given code is in the `process_response` method. It seems that the `_redirect` and `_redirect_request_using_get` methods are not properly defined and need to be updated.

The reason behind the bug could be that the `_redirect` and `_redirect_request_using_get` methods are being called within the `process_response` method without being properly defined.

To fix the bug, the `_redirect` and `_redirect_request_using_get` methods need to be properly defined as part of the class and called using `self`. Additionally, any variables or methods being used within the `process_response` method should be properly initialized and defined.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` method:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = safe_url_string(response.headers['location'])

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

# define _redirect method
def _redirect(self, redirected, request, spider, reason):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# define _redirect_request_using_get method
def _redirect_request_using_get(self, request, redirect_url):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass
```
