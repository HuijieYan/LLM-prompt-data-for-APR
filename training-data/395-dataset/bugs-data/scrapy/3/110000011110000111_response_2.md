The error message from the test function indicates that there is an issue with the redirection URL when the headers' location starts with three slashes. The expected redirection URL is not matching the actual redirection URL.

The potential error location is within the logic that handles the redirection process, specifically the part where the redirected URL is constructed using the 'Location' header.

The reason behind the bug is that the code does not handle the case where the 'Location' header starts with three slashes correctly. This leads to a mismatch between the expected and actual redirection URLs.

To fix the bug, the code needs to handle the case where the 'Location' header starts with three slashes by properly constructing the redirected URL.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = response.headers['location']
    if location.startswith('///'):
        location = 'http:' + location  # Assuming HTTP protocol, modify accordingly if different protocol is required

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

In the corrected code, when the 'Location' header starts with three slashes, it is modified to comply with the standard URL format before constructing the redirected URL. This ensures that the redirection URL is properly handled even when the 'Location' header starts with three slashes.
