The bug occurs in the `process_response` method of the `RedirectMiddleware` class. When the `response` status is 302 and the `Location` header value starts with three slashes (`///`), the redirected URL is being incorrectly joined with the original request URL.

The reason for the bug is that the `urljoin` function is used to join the original request URL with the location, which results in an incorrect URL when the location starts with `///`.

To fix the bug, the `redirected_url` should be constructed by directly using the `location` from the response headers when it starts with `///`. 

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` method:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = safe_url_string(response.headers['location'])

    if location.startswith('///'):
        redirected_url = 'http:' + location  # Assuming the URL should start with 'http'
    else:
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

By directly using the `location` when it starts with `///`, we can ensure that the redirected URL is correctly constructed. This fix should address the issue described in the error message and the associated GitHub issue.
