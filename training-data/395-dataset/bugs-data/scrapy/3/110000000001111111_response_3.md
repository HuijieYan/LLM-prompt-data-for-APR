The bug occurs in the `process_response` function when the `Location` header in the response starts with three slashes (///). The function incorrectly handles such cases and generates a redirected URL different from what is expected. This is evident from the GitHub issue description where a user expected the redirection to `https://fr.hujiang.com/new/p1285798/` but got redirected to `https://www.hjenglish.com/fr.hujiang.com/new/p1285798` instead.

The problem likely arises from the `if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:` condition, which does not account for the case where the `Location` header starts with three slashes.

To fix this issue, we need to consider the scenario where the `Location` header starts with three slashes and handle it appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` function:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers:
        return response

    location = response.headers['location'].decode('utf-8')  # Convert bytes to string
    if location.startswith('///'):
        location = 'https://' + location[3:]  # Replace /// with https://

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

With this correction, the function now properly handles the case where the `Location` header starts with three slashes by replacing it with `https://` and then proceeding with the redirection process. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub description.
