The potential error in the provided function is that it is not correctly handling the redirection of requests based on response status and meta-refresh html tag. The function is supposed to handle responses with specific status codes and redirect the request accordingly.

The error occurs due to incorrect logic and conditions in the function. The function should check if the response status requires redirection and handle it accordingly. However, the existing conditions and logic are not handling the redirection properly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditions to correctly check for the response status and handle redirection accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False):
        return response
    
    if response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False):
        return response
    
    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response
    
    location = safe_url_string(response.headers['location'])
    
    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)
    
    if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
    
    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```
