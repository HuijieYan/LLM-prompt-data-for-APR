The bug occurs when the response's headers' "Location" field starts with three slashes ("///"). In this case, the URL redirection is not handled correctly, resulting in the redirected URL being constructed incorrectly.

The issue seems to be in the code segment where the "Location" header is processed and the redirected URL is constructed.

To fix the bug, when the "Location" header starts with three slashes, they should be replaced with a single slash before constructing the redirected URL. This will ensure that the URL is correctly formed and the redirection behaves as expected.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response
    
    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response
    
    location = safe_url_string(response.headers['location'])
    
    if location.startswith('///'):
        location = '/' + location.lstrip('/')
    
    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)
    
    if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
    
    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```
