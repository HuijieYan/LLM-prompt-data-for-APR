The test case `test_redirect_302_relative` checks the behavior of the `process_response` function of the `RedirectMiddleware` class when a `302` response is received with a relative URL in the `Location` header. The expected behavior is that the relative URL should be resolved and the resulting absolute URL should be used to create a new `Request` object. 

The error message indicates that the actual URL after redirection does not match the expected URL, which suggests that the redirection mechanism is not working correctly.

The potential error location within the `process_response` function is the construction of the `redirected_url` and the subsequent creation of the `redirected` request.

The bug is occurring because the calculation of the `redirected_url` is incorrect. The current function `urljoin(request.url, location)` does not handle relative URLs correctly, which leads to incorrect redirection.

To fix the bug, the function should use the `urljoin` method to handle relative URLs properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` function of the `RedirectMiddleware` class:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = safe_url_string(response.headers['Location'])

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)  # Use urljoin to handle relative URLs

    if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

With this corrected code, the bug in the redirection process should be resolved, and the test case should pass successfully.
