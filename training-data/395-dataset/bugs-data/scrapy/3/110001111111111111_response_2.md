The error occurs because the `safe_url_string` method is not handling the case where the 'Location' URL provided by the response starts with three slashes ('///'). This leads to incorrect URL resolution.

The correct approach to fixing the bug would be to modify the `safe_url_string` method to handle the case where the input URL starts with three slashes. This can be achieved by checking if the URL starts with '///' and then replacing it with the appropriate scheme ('http' or 'https') and two slashes. Additionally, the 'safe_url_string' method should handle cases where the URL scheme is missing in the response.

The corrected code for the `process_response` function is as follows:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = response.headers.get('Location', b'').decode('utf-8')

    if location.startswith('///'):
        location = 'http://' + location.lstrip('/')
    elif not location.startswith(('http://', 'https://')):
        location = urljoin(request.url, location)

    redirected = request.replace(url=location)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

This corrected code ensures that the 'Location' URL is handled appropriately, taking into account cases where the URL starts with three slashes or lacks a scheme.
