The error occurs in the `test_redirect_302_relative` test case. It expects the redirected URL to be 'http://i8n.example2.com/302', but it receives 'http://www.example.com/i8n.example2.com/302'.

The potential error location within the `process_response` function is in the line:
```python
redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)
```
This line is responsible for joining the base URL with the relative URL found in the 'Location' header of the response.

The error occurs because when the 'Location' header starts with '///', the `urljoin` function considers it as a path without a specified scheme or host, resulting in an incorrect URL.

To fix this bug, we should check the format of the 'Location' header before joining it with the base URL. If it starts with '///', we need to handle it differently than a regular relative URL.

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urljoin

class RedirectMiddleware(BaseRedirectMiddleware):
    # ... other code ...

    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        # ... previous code ...

        location = safe_url_string(response.headers['location'])

        redirected_url = location
        if location.startswith('///'):
            # Handle the '///' case differently
            parsed_request_url = urlparse(request.url)
            redirected_url = f"{parsed_request_url.scheme}://{parsed_request_url.netloc}{location.lstrip('/')}"
        else:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

        # ... remaining code ...
```

In the corrected function, we handle the '///' case by extracting the scheme and netloc from the original request URL and then joining them with the 'Location' header value without the leading slashes. This ensures that the redirection URL is correctly formed.
