The error occurs because the `redirected_url` is being generated incorrectly. It includes the original request URL (`request.url`) and the location (`///i8n.example2.com/302`) without joining them properly. This causes the test to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `redirected_url` variable to properly join the base URL (`request.url`) and the relative URL (`location`).

The corrected code for the `process_response` function is as follows:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = safe_url_string(response.headers['location'])

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

With this correction, the `redirected_url` is now properly joined using the `urljoin` function, ensuring that the test case for `test_redirect_302_relative` will pass without errors.
