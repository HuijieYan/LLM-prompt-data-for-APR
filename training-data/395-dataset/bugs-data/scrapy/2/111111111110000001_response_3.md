The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` because the comparison operator `>=` is being used between the length of the cache (`len(self)`) and `self.limit`, where `self.limit` seems to be `NoneType`.

The error is occurring on the line `while len(self) >= self.limit:` inside the `__setitem__` function of the `LocalCache` class. This is because the `LocalCache` class does not have a `limit` attribute defined, but the intention is to have a limit for the number of items in the cache. 

To fix this bug, the `limit` attribute needs to be added to the `LocalCache` class, and it should be initialized with a default value.

Here's the corrected code for the `LocalCache` class:

```python
import collections

class LocalCache(collections.OrderedDict):
    """
    Dictionary with a finite number of keys.
    
    Older items expire first.
    """

    def __init__(self, limit=None, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.limit = limit

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        while len(self) >= self.limit:
            self.popitem(last=False)
        super().__setitem__(key, value)
```

In this corrected code:
- The `limit` parameter is added to the `__init__` function of the `LocalCache` class, allowing it to be initialized with a limit.
- The `__setitem__` function compares the length of the cache with the `limit` attribute, addressing the TypeError that was occurring.

With these changes, the `LocalCache` class should work as expected and the test case should pass without any errors.
