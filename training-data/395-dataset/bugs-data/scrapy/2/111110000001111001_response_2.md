Potential error location:
The issue in the function is that it tries to access the `limit` property, which is not defined in the given code. This will result in an AttributeError.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `limit` property is not defined within the LocalCache class, so attempting to access it will result in an AttributeError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define the `limit` property within the LocalCache class.
2. Pass the `limit` value as a parameter to the __init__ function so that it can be used within the __setitem__ function.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class LocalCache(collections.OrderedDict):
    """
    Dictionary with a finite number of keys.
    
    Older items expires first.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, limit, *args, **kwargs):
        self.limit = limit
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        while len(self) >= self.limit:
            self.popitem(last=False)
        super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```

In the corrected code, the `limit` property is defined within the `LocalCache` class, and it is passed as a parameter to the `__init__` function, allowing it to be used within the `__setitem__` function.
