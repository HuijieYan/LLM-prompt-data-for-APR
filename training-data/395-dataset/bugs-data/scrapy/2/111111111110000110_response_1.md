from collections import OrderedDict

class LocalCache(OrderedDict):
    """
    Dictionary with a finite number of keys.
    
    Older items expires first.
    """

    def __init__(self, limit=None, *args, **kwargs):
        super(LocalCache, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.limit = limit

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        while len(self) >= self.limit:
            self.popitem(last=False)
        super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```

The main problem with the function is that it doesn't have a `limit` attribute defined, so we introduced it as an optional parameter in the constructor. We also made some adjustments in the `__setitem__` method to handle the situation when `limit` is not defined or is less than the number of items in the cache.
