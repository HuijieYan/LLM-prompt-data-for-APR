Potential error location:
The while loop condition is checking if the length of the dictionary is greater than or equal to the limit, but the 'limit' variable is not defined anywhere in the function or the class.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The 'limit' variable is not defined in the class or the function, so the condition in the while loop is not valid.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define the 'limit' variable as a class attribute and initialize it in the class constructor.
2. Pass the 'limit' as a parameter to the constructor of LocalCache.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
class LocalCache(collections.OrderedDict):
    """
    Dictionary with a finite number of keys.
    
    Older items expires first.
    """

    def __init__(self, limit):
        super().__init__()
        self.limit = limit

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        while len(self) >= self.limit:
            self.popitem(last=False)
        super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```
