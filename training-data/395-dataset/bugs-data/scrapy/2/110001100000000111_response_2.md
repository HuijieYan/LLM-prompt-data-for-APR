Potential error location: The while loop condition `while len(self) >= self.limit` seems to be the cause of the bug as it is not properly checking the length of the cache.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The condition `while len(self) >= self.limit` should be checking if the length of the cache exceeds the limit, but it is currently checking if it is equal to or greater than the limit. This will prevent items from being added to the cache when its length is equal to the limit.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Change the condition to `while len(self) > self.limit` so that it checks if the length of the cache exceeds the limit, allowing items to be added if the length is less than the limit.

Corrected code:
```python
# this is the corrected function
def __setitem__(self, key, value):
    while len(self) > self.limit:
        self.popitem(last=False)
    super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```
