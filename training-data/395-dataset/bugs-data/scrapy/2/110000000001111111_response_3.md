Potential error location: The while loop condition `while len(self) >= self.limit` is incorrect and will cause an infinite loop as the length of the object will never change within the loop.

Reason for the bug: The condition `len(self) >= self.limit` should be checking if the length of the cache exceeds the limit, but instead it's checking if it's greater than or equal to the limit.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Change the condition to `while len(self) > self.limit`, and also make sure to handle the case where `self.limit` might be 0 or negative.

Corrected code:
```python
def __setitem__(self, key, value):
    if len(self) >= self.limit:
        self.popitem(last=False)
    super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```
