The error occurs in the line `while len(self) >= self.limit:` in the `__setitem__` method of the `LocalCache` class. The error message indicates that there is an issue with comparing the length of `self` with `self.limit`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that `self.limit` is not defined in the `LocalCache` class, which is causing the `TypeError`. 

To fix the bug, we need to initialize `self.limit` in the `LocalCache` class or remove the comparison with `self.limit` if it's not relevant to the logic of the `__setitem__` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `__setitem__` method in the `LocalCache` class:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class LocalCache(collections.OrderedDict):
    """
    Dictionary with a finite number of keys.
    
    Older items expires first.
    """

    def __init__(self, limit=None, *args, **kwargs):
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.limit = limit

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        if self.limit is not None:
            while len(self) >= self.limit:
                self.popitem(last=False)
        super().__setitem__(key, value)
```

In this corrected code, we added an `__init__` method to set the `self.limit` attribute when creating a `LocalCache` instance. Then, in the `__setitem__` method, we added a check to only perform the limit comparison if `self.limit` is not None.
