Potential error location: The issue lies in the while loop inside the __setitem__ function. This loop fails to correctly compare the length of the LocalCache with its limit, resulting in an infinite loop when the limit is reached.

Reasons behind the bug: The while loop condition is using ">=" instead of ">" to compare the length of the cache with its limit. This causes the loop to continue even when the length is equal to the limit, leading to an infinite loop.

Approach for fixing the bug: Change the condition of the while loop to use ">" instead of ">=" so that the loop exits when the length reaches the limit.

Corrected code:
```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class LocalCache(collections.OrderedDict):
    """
    Dictionary with a finite number of keys.
    
    Older items expires first.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # corrected function
    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        if len(self) >= self.limit:
            self.popitem(last=False)
        super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```
