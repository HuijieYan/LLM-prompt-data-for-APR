The potential error in the provided code is that the `__setitem__` function is defined three times with the same signature within the `LocalCache` class. This will result in only the last definition of the function being used, and the previous ones will be overridden. 

To fix this issue, we can combine the functionality of all three `__setitem__` functions into one.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs_non_pandas/repos/scrapy_2/scrapy/utils/datatypes.py

import collections

# class declaration containing the corrected function
class LocalCache(collections.OrderedDict):
    """
    Dictionary with a finite number of keys.
    
    Older items expires first.
    """

    # signature of the corrected function in this class
    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        while len(self) >= self.limit:
            self.popitem(last=False)
        super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```

In the corrected code, we have removed the duplicate `__setitem__` function definitions and combined their functionality into a single `__setitem__` function within the `LocalCache` class. This will resolve the issue of the overridden functions and ensure that the desired functionality is retained.
