Potential error location: The while loop condition `len(self) >= self.limit` may be causing the bug.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The condition `len(self) >= self.limit` should actually be `len(self) > self.limit` in order to maintain the correct logic for the function.

Approaches for fixing the bug: Update the while loop condition from `len(self) >= self.limit` to `len(self) > self.limit` to ensure that the function operates as intended.

Corrected code:

```python
def __setitem__(self, key, value):
    while len(self) > self.limit:
        self.popitem(last=False)
    super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```
