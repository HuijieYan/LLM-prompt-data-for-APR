The error message indicates that there is a TypeError occurring in the __setitem__ method at line 318 of the datatypes.py file. It seems that the comparison of the length of the cache with its limit is causing the error because self.limit is not defined.

The bug occurs because the LocalCache class does not have a limit attribute defined. The code is trying to compare the length of the cache with self.limit, which is leading to a TypeError because self.limit is not initialized and is None by default.

To fix the bug, we need to define the limit attribute for the LocalCache class and use it for comparison in the __setitem__ method. Then, we can update the method to compare the length of the cache with the limit and pop an item if the limit is exceeded. Here's the corrected code:

```python
class LocalCache(dict):
    def __init__(self, limit=None, *args, **kwargs):
        self.limit = limit
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        if self.limit is not None and len(self) >= self.limit:
            self.popitem(last=False)
        super().__setitem__(key, value)
```

In this corrected code, we define the LocalCache class and initialize the limit attribute in its constructor. Then, in the __setitem__ method, we check if the limit is not None and compare the length of the cache with the limit before adding a new item.

With this fix, the code should no longer produce the TypeError, and the test should pass without any issues.
