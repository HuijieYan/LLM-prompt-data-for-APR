The error is occurring because the `self.limit` variable is not defined in the `LocalCache` class. This is causing the comparison `len(self) >= self.limit` to fail, as `self.limit` is `None`. The buggy code is trying to compare the length of the cache with `self.limit`, but `self.limit` is not defined anywhere in the function.

To fix this bug, the `LocalCache` class needs to be modified to include a `limit` parameter that defines the maximum number of items the cache can hold.

Here's the corrected code for the `LocalCache` class and the `__setitem__` function:

```python
import collections

class LocalCache(collections.OrderedDict):
    """
    Dictionary with a finite number of keys.
    
    Older items expires first.
    """

    def __init__(self, limit=None, *args, **kwargs):
        self.limit = limit
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        if self.limit is not None:
            while len(self) >= self.limit:
                self.popitem(last=False)
        super().__setitem__(key, value)
```

In this corrected code:
- The `LocalCache` class constructor now includes a new `limit` parameter.
- The `__init__` method initializes the `limit` attribute with the provided limit, which defaults to `None`.
- The `__setitem__` method now checks if `self.limit` is not `None` before comparing the length of the cache with the limit.

With these changes, the `LocalCache` class should now work correctly and the test case should pass without any errors.
