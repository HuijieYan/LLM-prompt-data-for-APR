Potential error location: The while loop condition is checking for the length of self, but it should be checking the length of self cache.

Reason for the bug: The while loop condition is incorrect and will result in an infinite loop. This is because it is checking the length of the wrong object (self instead of self cache).

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Change the condition of the while loop to check the length of the self cache instead of self.

Corrected code:

```python
def __setitem__(self, key, value):
    while len(self.cache) >= self.limit:
        self.popitem(last=False)
    super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```
