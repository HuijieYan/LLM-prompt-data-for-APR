The error message indicates that there is a TypeError because the comparison between the length of the `self` object and the `limit` attribute is not supported. This suggests that the `limit` attribute is not being properly initialized in the `LocalCache` class.

Upon analyzing the buggy function, it is clear that the `__setitem__` method is meant to limit the size of the cache by removing items if the length of the cache exceeds the `limit`. However, it seems that the `limit` attribute is not defined in the provided code.

To fix this bug, we need to make sure that the `limit` attribute is properly initialized in the `LocalCache` class. We can also add a check to ensure that the `limit` is not None before comparing it with the length of the cache.

Here's the corrected code for the `LocalCache` class and the `__setitem__` method:

```python
class LocalCache(dict):
    def __init__(self, limit=None):
        self.limit = limit  # Initialize the limit attribute

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        if self.limit is not None:  # Add a check to ensure limit is not None
            while len(self) >= self.limit:
                self.popitem(last=False)
        super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```

By initializing the `limit` attribute in the `LocalCache` class, we ensure that it is available for comparison within the `__setitem__` method. Additionally, we added a check to ensure that the `limit` is not None before comparing it with the length of the cache.
