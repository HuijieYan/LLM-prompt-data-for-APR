The error message indicates that there is a comparison between the length of the cache (`len(self)`) and its limit, which is not defined. This comparison is causing a `TypeError` since the limit is not being properly set.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `while` loop where the comparison `len(self) >= self.limit` is taking place.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the limit for the cache is not being initialized or defined anywhere in the code, leading to a `NoneType` comparison error.

To fix the bug, the `limit` attribute needs to be initialized when the `LocalCache` class is instantiated. This can be done by adding a `limit` parameter in the `__init__` method of the `LocalCache` class. By doing so, the `limit` will be defined and the comparison in the `__setitem__` method will work correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class LocalCache:
    def __init__(self, limit=1000):  # Assuming a default limit of 1000
        self.limit = limit
        # other initialization code

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        while len(self) >= self.limit:
            self.popitem(last=False)
        super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```
