The potential error in the provided function is that it is trying to call `self.popitem()` without defining or importing the `popitem()` method. This is likely causing a NameError when the function is called.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the method `popitem()` is defined or imported in the class `LocalCache`. If `popitem()` is already defined in the class, then the bug may be occurring due to incorrect usage of the method, in which case the method needs to be called correctly.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __setitem__(self, key, value):
    while len(self) >= self.limit:
        self.pop(key, None)
    super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```

In this corrected code, I have replaced `self.popitem()` with `self.pop(key, None)` as it seems like the intention was to remove an item with a specific key rather than calling `popitem()` without any arguments. If `popitem()` is the method that should be called, the correct use may need to be incorporated within this loop.
