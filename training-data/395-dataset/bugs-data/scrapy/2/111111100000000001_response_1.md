Potential error location: The while loop within the `__setitem__` function is not terminating, which will cause an infinite loop when the condition is always True.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The condition `while len(self) >= self.limit` is never being updated, causing the loop to continue indefinitely. This may be due to the missing definition of the `limit` attribute, which is used in the condition.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define the `limit` attribute in the `LocalCache` class.
2. Update the condition within the while loop to ensure it terminates based on a meaningful condition.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
class LocalCache(collections.OrderedDict):
    """
    Dictionary with a finite number of keys.
    
    Older items expires first.
    """

    def __init__(self, limit):
        super().__init__()
        self.limit = limit

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        while len(self) >= self.limit:
            self.popitem(last=False)
        super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```
