Potential Error Location: The error is likely occurring in the while loop where the condition `len(self) >= self.limit` is not being evaluated correctly.

Reasons for the Bug: One possible reason for the error is that the `self` object is not being properly referenced inside the function. Another reason could be that the `limit` attribute is not being initialized properly or is not accessible within the function.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the `self` object is correctly referenced within the function.
2. Verify that the `limit` attribute is properly initialized and accessible within the function.

Corrected Code:
```python
def __setitem__(self, key, value):
    while len(self.data) >= self.limit:
        self.popitem(last=False)
    super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```
