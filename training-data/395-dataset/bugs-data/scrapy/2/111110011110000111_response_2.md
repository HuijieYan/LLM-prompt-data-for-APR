The error message indicates that there is a TypeError being raised within the __setitem__ method of the LocalCache class. The error occurs on the line "while len(self) >= self.limit" suggesting that self.limit is of type None and cannot be compared with an integer.

The issue arises from using self.limit without defining it anywhere in the class. It seems like the intention is to use a limit for the number of keys in the cache, but it has not been defined.

To fix the bug, the limit for the number of keys in the cache needs to be explicitly defined in the LocalCache class, and then referenced correctly within the __setitem__ method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class LocalCache(collections.OrderedDict):
    """
    Dictionary with a finite number of keys.
    
    Older items expires first.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, limit=1000):
        super().__init__()
        self.limit = limit

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        while len(self) >= self.limit:
            self.popitem(last=False)
        super().__setitem__(key, value)
```

In this corrected code:
- The __init__ method has been added to initialize the LocalCache with a limit for the number of keys.
- The limit is now explicitly defined as an attribute of the LocalCache class, and it is used in the __setitem__ method.
