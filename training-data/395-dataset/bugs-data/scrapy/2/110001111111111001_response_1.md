The error message indicates a TypeError related to the comparison of the length of the cache with its limit. It seems that `self.limit` is not defined, which is causing the comparison to fail.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `while len(self) >= self.limit:`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that `self.limit` is not initialized or defined within the LocalCache class.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `self.limit` is properly defined within the LocalCache class. Once `self.limit` is defined, the comparison in the while loop should work as intended.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class LocalCache:
    def __init__(self, limit=None):
        self.limit = limit
        # ... other initialization code ...

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        if self.limit is not None:
            while len(self) >= self.limit:
                self.popitem(last=False)
        super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```

In this corrected code, the `__init__` method of the LocalCache class now takes a `limit` parameter and sets `self.limit` accordingly. The `__setitem__` method now checks if `self.limit` is not None before applying the limit logic.
