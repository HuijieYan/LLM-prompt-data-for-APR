Potential error location: The error seems to be occurring in the while loop condition `while len(self) >= self.limit`. It appears that `self.limit` is not defined, which is causing the TypeError.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug is occurring because the `self.limit` attribute is not defined in the `LocalCache` class. The function is trying to compare the length of `self` with `self.limit`, but `self.limit` is not initialized, resulting in the TypeError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define the `self.limit` attribute in the `LocalCache` class and initialize it with a value.
2. Update the while loop condition to compare the length of `self` with a predefined limit value instead of `self.limit`.

Corrected code:

```python
# Corrected function
def __setitem__(self, key, value):
    limit = 100  # Replace 100 with the desired limit value
    while len(self) >= limit:
        self.popitem(last=False)
    super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```
