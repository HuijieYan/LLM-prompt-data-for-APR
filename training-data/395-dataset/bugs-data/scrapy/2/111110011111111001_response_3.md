Potential Error Location: The error seems to be occurring in the __setitem__ function of the LocalCache class. Specifically, the comparison between the length of the cache and the limit is causing a TypeError.

Reason for the Bug: The error message indicates that the comparison between the length of the cache and the limit is not supported. This implies that the 'limit' attribute has not been defined for the LocalCache class.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Define a 'limit' attribute for the LocalCache class to determine the maximum number of keys allowed in the cache.
2. Modify the comparison in the __setitem__ function to use the 'limit' attribute for checking whether the cache has reached its limit.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:
```python
class LocalCache(collections.OrderedDict):
    """
    Dictionary with a finite number of keys.
    
    Older items expires first.
    """

    def __init__(self, limit=None):
        self.limit = limit  # set the limit attribute in the constructor
        super().__init__()

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        if self.limit is not None:  # check if the limit is defined
            while len(self) >= self.limit:
                self.popitem(last=False)
        super().__setitem__(key, value)
```

In the corrected code, the 'limit' attribute is defined in the constructor of the LocalCache class, and the __setitem__ function now uses this attribute to check the cache limit. This should resolve the TypeError and ensure that the cache behaves as intended.
