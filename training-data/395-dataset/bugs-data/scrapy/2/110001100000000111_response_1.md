Potential Error Location:
The error might be occurring due to the while loop condition, which should be checking whether the length of the cache is greater than the limit instead of checking if it's greater than or equal to the limit. This could result in an extra iteration that exceeds the limit.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The while loop condition is not properly checking the length of the cache, leading to a potential issue where an extra iteration occurs, exceeding the limit of the cache.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Change the while loop condition to check if the length of the cache is greater than the limit.
2. Make sure to handle the case where the cache is full and a new item is being added.

Corrected Code:
```python
def __setitem__(self, key, value):
    while len(self) > self.limit:
        self.popitem(last=False)
    super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```
