The error message indicates a TypeError related to comparing the length of the cache to its limit. The code attempts to compare the length of the cache to a limit that has not been defined, resulting in a comparison between an integer and NoneType.

The potential error location is the comparison statement 'while len(self) >= self.limit' within the __setitem__ method of the LocalCache class.

The bug occurs because the 'limit' attribute has not been defined within the LocalCache class. This causes the comparison 'len(self) >= self.limit' to result in a TypeError because 'self.limit' is undefined (NoneType).

To fix this bug, the 'limit' attribute should be defined in the LocalCache class, providing a finite number of cache keys. It's important to also verify that the 'limit' attribute is provided during object instantiation.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class LocalCache(collections.OrderedDict):
    """
    Dictionary with a finite number of keys.
    
    Older items expire first.
    """

    def __init__(self, limit=None):
        super().__init__()
        self.limit = limit

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        if self.limit is not None:
            while len(self) >= self.limit:
                self.popitem(last=False)
        super().__setitem__(key, value)
```

In the corrected code:
- The __init__ method is used to initialize the LocalCache object with the 'limit' attribute.
- The __setitem__ method checks if the 'limit' attribute is set before performing the comparison. If the 'limit' is defined, the comparison and cache management is carried out, ensuring that the cache does not exceed the defined limit.
