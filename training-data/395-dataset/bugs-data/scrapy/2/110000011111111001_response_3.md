The error message indicates a TypeError on line 318 of the datatypes.py file, specifically with the comparison of the length of the cache (self) and the limit. This suggests that the 'limit' attribute is not being properly defined or initialized in the LocalCache class.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of the length of the cache with the limit attribute, which may not exist or be initialized properly.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the 'limit' attribute is not properly defined or initialized in the LocalCache class, causing the comparison to fail.

To fix the bug, the 'limit' attribute needs to be added to the LocalCache class and properly initialized. Once the limit is defined, the comparison within the __setitem__ method can be performed without error.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class LocalCache(dict):
    def __init__(self, limit=None):
        self.limit = limit
        super().__init__()

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        if self.limit is not None:
            while len(self) >= self.limit:
                self.popitem(last=False)
        super().__setitem__(key, value)
```

In this corrected code, the LocalCache class now initializes the 'limit' attribute in its constructor. The __setitem__ method has been modified to check if the limit is not None, and only then performs the comparison. This should fix the TypeError and allow the test function to run without errors.
