Potential Error Location: The potential error is in the while loop condition, which checks if the length of the cache is greater than or equal to the limit. 

Reason for the Bug: The bug occurs because the condition in the while loop will never be True because the loop will continuously execute as long as the condition is False. 

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug: We can change the condition of the while loop to "len(self) > self.limit" so that the loop will execute when the length exceeds the limit. 

Corrected Code:
```python
# corrected function
def __setitem__(self, key, value):
    if len(self) >= self.limit:
        self.popitem(last=False)
    super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```
