The error message indicates a TypeError related to the comparison between an integer and NoneType. This points to the problematic portion of the code where the length of the `self` object (which is expected to be a dictionary-like data structure or a custom class) is compared to a `limit` attribute, which seems to be None.

The bug is occurring because the 'limit' variable is not defined or initialized within the `LocalCache` class. This makes the comparison `len(self) >= self.limit` result in a TypeError due to the NoneType of `self.limit`.

To fix this bug, the 'limit' attribute needs to be defined and initialized within the `LocalCache` class. This attribute should be set to the desired limit of the cache.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class LocalCache:
    def __init__(self, limit=100):  # Initialize the 'limit' attribute with a default value
        self.limit = limit
        # ... (other initialization code) ...

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        while len(self) >= self.limit:
            self.popitem(last=False)
        super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```

With this corrected code, the `LocalCache` class now has a 'limit' attribute that is set to a default value of 100. This will prevent the TypeError that was occurring due to the comparison with a NoneType.
