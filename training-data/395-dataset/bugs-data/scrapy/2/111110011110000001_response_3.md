1. The test case is trying to add a large number of items to the `cache` without specifying a limit. This is triggering the error related to the comparison of an integer with a `NoneType`.

2. The potential error location is within the `__setitem__` method of the `LocalCache` class, specifically in the line `while len(self) >= self.limit:`.

3. The error occurs because `self.limit` is not defined within the `LocalCache` class, leading to a comparison between an integer (`len(self)`) and `None` (`self.limit`).

4. To fix the bug, we need to add a `limit` attribute to the `LocalCache` class and use it in the comparison in the `__setitem__` method. We can also provide a default value for `limit` if it's not specified.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `__setitem__` method:

```python
class LocalCache(collections.OrderedDict):
    """
    Dictionary with a finite number of keys.
    
    Older items expires first.
    """

    def __init__(self, limit=None, *args, **kwargs):
        self.limit = limit
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        if self.limit is not None:
            while len(self) >= self.limit:
                self.popitem(last=False)
        super().__setitem__(key, value)
```

In this corrected code, we added an `__init__` method to initialize the `limit` attribute, and we modified the `__setitem__` method to use the `limit` attribute for comparison. The use of `super()` with no arguments allows for compatibility with both Python 2 and Python 3.
