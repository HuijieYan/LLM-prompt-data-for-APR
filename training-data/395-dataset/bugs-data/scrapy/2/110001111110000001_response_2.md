The error occurs in the __setitem__ method of the LocalCache class. The error message indicates that there is a TypeError because the "len(self)" is being compared with "self.limit", and "self.limit" is of type None.

The potential error is that "self.limit" is not defined, and this is causing the comparison to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that "self.limit" is defined and has a value before performing the comparison. One approach is to add an instance variable "limit" to the LocalCache class, and set a default value for it. Then the comparison can be safely performed.

Here's the corrected code for the __setitem__ method:

```python
class LocalCache:
    def __init__(self, limit=None):
        self.limit = limit
        self.cache = {}

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        if self.limit is not None:
            while len(self.cache) >= self.limit:
                self.cache.popitem(last=False)
        self.cache[key] = value
```

In this corrected code, we added a new instance variable "limit" to the LocalCache class, and in the __init__ method we set a default value of None for it. Then in the __setitem__ method, we check if "limit" is not None before performing the comparison, and make necessary adjustments to the cache.
