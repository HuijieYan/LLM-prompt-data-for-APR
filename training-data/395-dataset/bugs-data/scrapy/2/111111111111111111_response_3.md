Potential error:
The error occurs because the `limit` variable is not defined within the `LocalCache` class, and the comparison `len(self) >= self.limit` is trying to compare the length of the cache with an undefined limit.

Reason behind the bug:
The `limit` variable is not defined within the `LocalCache` class, and as a result, the comparison between the length of the cache and the limit is failing, leading to a TypeError.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
Define the `limit` variable within the `LocalCache` class and use it in the comparison.

Corrected code:

```python
import collections

class LocalCache(collections.OrderedDict):
    """
    Dictionary with a finite number of keys.
    
    Older items expire first.
    """

    def __init__(self, limit=None):
        super(LocalCache, self).__init__()
        self.limit = limit

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        while self.limit is not None and len(self) >= self.limit:
            self.popitem(last=False)
        super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```

In the corrected code, the `limit` variable is defined within the `__init__` method of the `LocalCache` class, and it is used within the `__setitem__` method to compare the length of the cache with the limit.
