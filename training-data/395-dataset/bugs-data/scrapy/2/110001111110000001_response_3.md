The error message indicates that there is a TypeError because the comparison of the length of `self` and `self.limit` is not supported. This means that `self.limit` is not defined or has the value of `None`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is this line:
```python
while len(self) >= self.limit:
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that `self.limit` is not defined or initialized with a value, hence the comparison with `len(self)` is resulting in a TypeError.

To fix this bug, the `__setitem__` method should be modified to properly handle the case when `self.limit` is not specified. One approach is to introduce a condition to check if `self.limit` is not None, and only then perform the comparison and popitem operation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def __setitem__(self, key, value):
    if self.limit is not None:
        while len(self) >= self.limit:
            self.popitem(last=False)
    super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```
