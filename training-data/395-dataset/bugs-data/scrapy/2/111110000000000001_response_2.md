The bug in the provided code is that the `limit` attribute is being used in the `__setitem__` function without being defined. This implies that the `limit` attribute is expected to be defined in the `LocalCache` class but it's not specified in the provided code.

To fix this bug, the `limit` attribute needs to be defined in the `LocalCache` class, and then it can be used in the `__setitem__` function to limit the number of keys in the dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the fixed function
class LocalCache(collections.OrderedDict):
    """
    Dictionary with a finite number of keys.
    
    Older items expires first.
    """

    def __init__(self, limit, *args, **kwargs):
        self.limit = limit
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

    # this is the fixed function
    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        while len(self) >= self.limit:
            self.popitem(last=False)
        super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
``` 

In the corrected code:
1. The `__init__` method is used to initialize the `limit` attribute when creating an instance of the `LocalCache` class.
2. The `__setitem__` function now uses the `limit` attribute to limit the number of keys in the dictionary.
