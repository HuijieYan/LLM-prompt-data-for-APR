The error message indicates that the comparison between the length of the cache and the limit is causing a TypeError because the "limit" attribute is not defined in the "LocalCache" class.

To fix this issue, the "limit" attribute should be defined within the "LocalCache" class and used for comparison in the `__setitem__` method. Additionally, the `LocalCache` class should be a subclass of `dict` in order to use the `popitem` and `__setitem__` methods properly. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class LocalCache(dict):
    def __init__(self, limit=100):
        super().__init__()
        self.limit = limit

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        while len(self) >= self.limit:
            self.popitem(last=False)
        super().__setitem__(key, value)
```

In this corrected code:
- We define `LocalCache` as a subclass of `dict` to inherit the functionality of a dictionary.
- We initialize the limit attribute in the constructor, with a default value of 100.
- We use the limit attribute in the `__setitem__` method for comparison with the length of the cache.
- We properly call the `popitem` and `__setitem__` methods using `super().__setitem__` and `super().__setitem__`.

After making these changes, the `__setitem__` method should work as intended without causing a TypeError.
