Potential error location: 
The error is occurring inside the __setitem__ method where there is a comparison between the length of the cache and its limit. 

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The error message indicates that there is a comparison between an integer and NoneType, which suggests that the 'limit' attribute of the cache might not have been initialized properly. This could be because the 'limit' attribute is not defined in the LocalCache class, or it is not being set to a valid value before the comparison.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the 'limit' attribute is properly initialized and set to a valid value in the LocalCache class.
2. Check if the 'limit' attribute is being set correctly before the comparison in the __setitem__ method.
3. Make sure that the 'limit' attribute is of integer type and is not None.

Corrected code:

```python
class LocalCache:
    def __init__(self, limit=None):
        self.limit = limit
        # ... other initialization code ...

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        if self.limit is not None:
            while len(self) >= self.limit:
                self.popitem(last=False)
        super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```
