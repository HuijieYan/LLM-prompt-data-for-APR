Potential error location:
The potential error is in the while loop condition where it checks the length of the object "self". It seems like "self" is expected to be a dictionary-like object (due to the use of popitem and __setitem__), but it's not explicitly defined in the function, and it doesn't seem to be initialized within the function either.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The error occurs because the function is trying to access the "self" object without properly initializing it. As a result, it's not clear what "self" is, and the function cannot perform the intended operations.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that "self" is properly initialized as a dictionary-like object before using it in the while loop.
2. Define the "limit" attribute for the "LocalCache" class and use it as a limit for the while loop condition.
3. Consider using a different approach to achieve the desired functionality, such as using a custom method to handle the limit check and item removal.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
class LocalCache(dict):
    def __init__(self, limit):
        super().__init__()
        self.limit = limit

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        while len(self) >= self.limit:
            self.popitem(last=False)
        super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```
