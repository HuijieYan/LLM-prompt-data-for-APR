Potential error location: The while loop condition is checking if the length of the cache is greater than or equal to the limit, but it should be checking if it's strictly greater than the limit.

Reason for the bug: The current condition allows the length of the cache to be equal to the limit before attempting to remove an item, which may result in the limit being exceeded.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the while loop condition to check if the length of the cache is strictly greater than the limit.
2. Add a check to ensure that the limit is not set to a non-positive value.

Corrected code:

```python
def __setitem__(self, key, value):
    if self.limit > 0:
        while len(self) > self.limit:
            self.popitem(last=False)
        super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
    else:
        raise ValueError("Limit must be a positive value")
```
