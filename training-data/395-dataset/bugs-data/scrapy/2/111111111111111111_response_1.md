The error message indicates a TypeError occurring in the "__setitem__" method of the "LocalCache" class when trying to compare the length of the cache with its "limit" attribute, which seems to be uninitialized.

The potential error location is the comparison "len(self) >= self.limit" inside the while loop.

The bug occurred because the "limit" attribute is not defined or initialized within the "LocalCache" class. This leads to the comparison of the length of the cache with "None," resulting in a TypeError.

To fix the bug, the "limit" attribute needs to be defined and initialized in the "LocalCache" class. Once the "limit" attribute is initialized, the comparison with the length of the cache will work as intended.

Here's the corrected code for the "__setitem__" method of the "LocalCache" class:

```python
class LocalCache(collections.OrderedDict):
    """
    Dictionary with a finite number of keys.
    Older items expires first.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, limit=None, *args, **kwargs):
        self.limit = limit
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)
    
    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        if self.limit is not None:
            while len(self) >= self.limit:
                self.popitem(last=False)
        super().__setitem__(key, value)
```

In this corrected code, we have added an "__init__" method to initialize the "limit" attribute and modified the "__setitem__" method to check if the "limit" is not None before performing the comparison. Then, the "__setitem__" method calls the super method to set the item in the cache.
