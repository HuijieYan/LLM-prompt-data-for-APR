Potential Error Location: The error is likely occurring in the while loop where the length of the cache is checked against the limit.

Reason for the Bug: The bug is likely occurring because the `limit` attribute is not defined within the `LocalCache` class. This is causing the comparison `len(self) >= self.limit` to fail, leading to unexpected behavior.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: 
1. Define the `limit` attribute within the `LocalCache` class.
2. Use a different way to check the length of the cache against a limit.

Corrected Code:
```python
class LocalCache(collections.OrderedDict):
    """
    Dictionary with a finite number of keys.
    
    Older items expires first.
    """

    def __init__(self, limit):
        super().__init__()
        self.limit = limit

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        while len(self) >= self.limit:
            self.popitem(last=False)
        super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```
