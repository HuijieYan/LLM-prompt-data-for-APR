Potential error: The problematic function __setitem__ has a while loop that checks if the length of the dictionary is greater than or equal to self.limit. However, the variable self.limit is not defined anywhere in the class.

Reason for the bug: The while loop condition is attempting to use a variable self.limit, which has not been defined anywhere in the class. This will lead to a NameError as it tries to access an undefined variable.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Define the self.limit variable within the class or pass it as an argument to the __init__ method of the class.

Corrected code:

```python
import collections

# class declaration containing the corrected function
class LocalCache(collections.OrderedDict):
    """
    Dictionary with a finite number of keys.
    
    Older items expires first.
    """

    def __init__(self, limit):
        super().__init__()
        self.limit = limit

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        while len(self) >= self.limit:
            self.popitem(last=False)
        super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```
