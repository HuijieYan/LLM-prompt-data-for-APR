The bug in the provided code is that the `limit` attribute is being used without it being defined anywhere in the class. This causes the code to raise a `NameError` when the `__setitem__` method is called.

To fix this bug:
1. The `limit` attribute needs to be defined in the `LocalCache` class to specify the maximum number of keys allowed in the dictionary.
2. The `__init__` method of the `LocalCache` class should be defined to initialize the `limit` attribute.
3. The `__setitem__` method should then be modified to use the `limit` attribute to check if the dictionary has reached its maximum capacity.

Here's the corrected code for the `LocalCache` class and the `__setitem__` method:

```python
import collections

# class declaration containing the corrected function
class LocalCache(collections.OrderedDict):
    """
    Dictionary with a finite number of keys.
    
    Older items expire first.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, limit, *args, **kwargs):
        self.limit = limit
        super(LocalCache, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        while len(self) >= self.limit:
            self.popitem(last=False)
        super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```

In this corrected code:
- The `limit` attribute is initialized in the `__init__` method by being passed as an argument when creating a new `LocalCache` object.
- The `__setitem__` method now uses the `limit` attribute to check if the dictionary has reached its maximum capacity. If it has, the method removes the oldest item before adding the new item.
