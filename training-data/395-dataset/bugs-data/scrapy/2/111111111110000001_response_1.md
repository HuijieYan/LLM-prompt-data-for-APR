Potential error location: The problematic function `__setitem__(self, key, value)` in the `LocalCache` class is causing the error. The error is occurring in the while loop condition `while len(self) >= self.limit`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The error message indicates that there is a TypeError because the comparison `>=` is not supported between instances of 'int' and 'NoneType'. This suggests that `self.limit` is currently set to `None`, causing the comparison to fail.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Initialize `self.limit` within the `LocalCache` class to ensure it is not `None`.
2. Provide a default value for `self.limit` in case it is not specified during the initialization of the `LocalCache` object.
3. Modify the while loop condition to handle the case where `self.limit` is `None`.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class LocalCache(collections.OrderedDict):
    """
    Dictionary with a finite number of keys.
    
    Older items expire first.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def __init__(self, limit=None, *args, **kwargs):
        super(LocalCache, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)
        self.limit = limit

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        if self.limit is not None:
            while len(self) >= self.limit:
                self.popitem(last=False)
        super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```

In this corrected code, the `LocalCache` class now initializes the `self.limit` attribute in the `__init__` method. The `__setitem__` method checks if `self.limit` is not `None` before using it in the while loop condition. This ensures that the comparison error is avoided.
