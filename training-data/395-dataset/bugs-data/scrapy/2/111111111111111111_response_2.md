The error message indicates a TypeError occurring in the __setitem__ function within the LocalCache class. The error occurs when trying to compare the length of the cache with its limit, which is likely to be None.

The potential error location within the __setitem__ function is the line:
```python
while len(self) >= self.limit:
```

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the 'limit' attribute of the LocalCache class is not defined, resulting in it being compared to None, hence raising the TypeError.

To fix the bug, the 'limit' attribute needs to be defined in the LocalCache class or passed as a parameter to the class initializer. If the limit is intended to be a constant value, it should be defined within the class. If the limit is intended to be customizable for each instance of LocalCache, it should be passed as a parameter to the class initializer.

Here's the corrected code for the __setitem__ function:

```python
def __setitem__(self, key, value):
    if not hasattr(self, 'limit'):
        self.limit = 100  # Assuming limit is a constant with a default value of 100
    while len(self) >= self.limit:
        self.popitem(last=False)
    super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```

In this corrected code, I've added a check for the existence of the 'limit' attribute in the LocalCache class. If it doesn't exist, it's set to a default value of 100. This ensures that the comparison in the while loop won't raise a TypeError due to 'limit' being None.
