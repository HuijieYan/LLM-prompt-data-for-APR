Potential error location:
The error is occurring in the `__setitem__` method of the LocalCache class, specifically in the line `while len(self) >= self.limit`. The error message indicates that there is a TypeError when comparing the length of `self` with `self.limit`.

Reasons behind the bug:
The error is occurring because the `self.limit` attribute is not defined within the LocalCache class, causing it to be `None`. This results in a TypeError when trying to compare the length of the cache with `None`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define a `limit` attribute in the LocalCache class to specify the maximum limit for the cache.
2. Modify the comparison in the `__setitem__` method to first check if the limit is defined before comparing the length of the cache.

Corrected code:
```python
def __setitem__(self, key, value):
    if self.limit is not None and len(self) >= self.limit:
        self.popitem(last=False)
    super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```
