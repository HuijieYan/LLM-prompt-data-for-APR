The potential error in the provided code is that the `__setitem__` method is defined multiple times within the `LocalCache` class. This is not allowed in Python.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `__setitem__` method is being redefined multiple times within the same class, which is not allowed in Python.

To fix this bug, we can simply remove the extra definitions of the `__setitem__` method. We only need to keep one definition of it.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs_non_pandas/repos/scrapy_2/scrapy/utils/datatypes.py

from collections import OrderedDict

class LocalCache(OrderedDict):
    """
    Dictionary with a finite number of keys.
    
    Older items expires first.
    """

    def __init__(self, limit):
        super().__init__()
        self.limit = limit

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        while len(self) >= self.limit:
            self.popitem(last=False)
        super().__setitem__(key, value)
```

In the corrected code, we have removed the extra definitions of the `__setitem__` method and kept only one definition within the `LocalCache` class. Additionally, we have also added an `__init__` method to initialize the `limit` variable.
