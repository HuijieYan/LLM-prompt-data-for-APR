1. The test case is attempting to add items to a LocalCache without a limit. It is expected that the cache will be able to store all the items.

2. The potential error location is within the __setitem__ method of the LocalCache class.

3. The error occurs because the code attempts to compare the length of the cache with its limit, but the limit is not defined.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the limit is defined for the LocalCache and compare the length with the limit only if the limit is not None.

5. Corrected code:

```python
# corrected __setitem__ method
def __setitem__(self, key, value):
    if self.limit is not None:
        while len(self) >= self.limit:
            self.popitem(last=False)
    super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```
