The bug seems to be occurring in the `ItemMeta` class method `__new__`. The error message indicates that the `MyItem` class is being defined incorrectly, likely due to how the `ItemMeta` class is handling the creation of the new class.

The bug is likely occurring because the `ItemMeta` class is not properly handling the class creation and inheritance, leading to the incorrect definition of the `MyItem` class.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `__new__` method in the `ItemMeta` class to correctly handle the class creation and inheritance.

Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` method in the `ItemMeta` class:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super().__new__(mcs, class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return type(class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

This corrected code properly handles the class creation and inheritance, and should resolve the issue with defining the `MyItem` class. It also simplifies the return statement to use the `type` function directly for class creation.
