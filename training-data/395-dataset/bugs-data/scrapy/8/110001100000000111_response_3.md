Potential error location: 

The line `new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))` could be causing the error, as it tries to access the `_class` attribute from the base class without checking if it exists or not.

Reasons behind the bug:

The error is likely occurring because the `base` objects may not have `_class` attribute, and it's trying to access it without checking for its existence.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Check if the `base` objects have the `_class` attribute before accessing it.
2. Update the logic for constructing `new_bases` to handle inheritance properly.

Corrected code:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```
