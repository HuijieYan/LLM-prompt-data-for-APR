Potential error location: The error might occur in the line where the `__new__` method is trying to create a new class instance using `super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)`. 

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug seems to be related to the incorrect usage of the `super()` function, which is not properly passing the arguments to the superclass `__new__` method.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- The correct usage of the `super()` function should be used to call the parent class `__new__` method. 
- Ensure that the correct arguments are passed to the superclass `__new__` method.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super().__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super().__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```
