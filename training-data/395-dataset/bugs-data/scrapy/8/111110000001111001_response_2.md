The bug occurs in the `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` class. The function attempts to create a new class using the `class_name`, `bases`, and `attrs` parameters, but there is a mistake in how the `new_bases` is calculated and used in the subsequent code.

The bug occurs because the `new_bases` are calculated using the `_class` attribute of the `bases` tuple, which may result in an empty `new_bases`. This is incorrect and does not capture the actual base classes that should be used for the new class.

To fix the bug, the calculation of `new_bases` should be adjusted to correctly filter out the base classes from the `bases` parameter without relying on the `_class` attribute.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```
