The potential error location within the provided function is in the second `return` statement where it calls `super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)`. This is likely causing an infinite recursion, as it's trying to call itself inside itself.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is calling itself when it should actually be calling the parent class's `__new__` method. This causes an infinite recursion and eventually a stack overflow error.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to use `super().__new__` instead of explicitly referencing the `ItemMeta` superclass. 

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super().__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return _class
```
