Potential Error Location: 
The error location seems to be within the for loop that iterates through the attributes of the _class.  

Reasons behind the Bug:
The code is trying to extract fields from the _class and store them in the 'fields' dictionary. However, the logic for extracting and checking fields might be incorrect, leading to unexpected behavior.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use the correct logic to extract the fields from the _class.
2. Ensure that the correct attributes are being checked and added to the 'fields' dictionary.

Corrected Code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_8/scrapy/item.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):  # Assuming Field is the correct class for fields
            fields[n] = v
        else:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```
