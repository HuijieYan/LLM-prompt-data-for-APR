The test case creates a new class `MyItem` using `ItemMeta` as a metaclass. The `ItemMeta` class is not functioning as expected, causing a `TypeError` during the creation of `MyItem`. This indicates that the metaclass is failing to set the correct class for `MyItem`.

The problematic function is `__new__` inside the `ItemMeta` class. In this function, a new class is created by calling `super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)`, which is then modified by adding fields and attributes before being returned.

The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of the base classes while creating the new class and not properly updating the attributes and fields in the new class.

To fix the bug, the `__new__` method should correctly handle the base classes and properly update the attributes and fields in the new class before returning.

```python
# Corrected __new__ method
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))  # corrected handling of base classes
    new_class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = getattr(new_class, 'fields', {})
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(new_class):
        v = getattr(new_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = new_class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)  # corrected returning the new class
```

By using the corrected code for the `__new__` method, the bug should be fixed, and the `TypeError` during the creation of `MyItem` should be resolved.
