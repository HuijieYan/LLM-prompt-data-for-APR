Potential Error:
The function is trying to create a new class by modifying the class name and adding some attributes, but the implementation has some errors, especially in terms of using the `super` function.

Reason for the Bug:
The implementation is using `super()` incorrectly and trying to call `__new__` on the metaclass instead of the class itself, leading to a recursion error.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use `super()` to call the `__new__` method of the superclass to create the new class.
2. Properly handle the modification of class name and addition of attributes.

Corrected Code:
```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
        new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
        new_class_name = 'x_' + class_name
        _class = super().__new__(mcs, new_class_name, new_bases, attrs)
        
        fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
        new_attrs = {}
        for n in dir(_class):
            v = getattr(_class, n)
            if isinstance(v, Field):
                fields[n] = v
            elif n in attrs:
                new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]
        
        new_attrs['fields'] = fields
        new_attrs['_class'] = _class
        return super().__new__(mcs, new_class_name, new_bases, new_attrs)
```
