The error occurs when the class `MyItem` is defined using `six.with_metaclass(ItemMeta, Item)`. The problem is likely in the `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` metaclass. The method is currently creating a new class with modified bases and attributes, but the logic is incorrect, causing the error mentioned in the test function.

The error occurs because the `__new__` method is called twice, and it is modifying the input arguments incorrectly. The first call to `super` should return the class with the modified bases and attributes, and the second call to `super` should return the original class with modified attributes.

To fix the bug, the corrected `__new__` method should return the modified class and attributes in the first call, and it should not call `__new__` again.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    new_class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = getattr(new_class, 'fields', {})
    for n in dir(new_class):
        v = getattr(new_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v

    new_attrs = attrs.copy()
    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = new_class

    return new_class
```
