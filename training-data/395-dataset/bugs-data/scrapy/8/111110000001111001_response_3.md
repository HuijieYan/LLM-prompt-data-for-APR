The problem in the code lies in the return statement. The `__new__` method of `ItemMeta` should be constructing an instance of the class and populating its fields, but the return statement is creating a new class instead, which results in the incorrect return value.

To fix the bug, the return statement should be constructing an instance of the class with updated attributes.

Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` method:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    for base in bases:
        if hasattr(base, '_class'):
            new_bases += (base._class,)
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class

    return type(class_name, new_bases, new_attrs)
```
