The bug is occurring because the mcs.__new__ function is incorrectly implemented. It is attempting to re-implement the constructor, but it's incorrectly referring to ItemMeta class as a superclass, which is causing the TypeError when attempting to use inheritance on Item.

To fix this bug, the correct approach is to modify the __new__ function to handle the inheritance properly and return the expected values. We also need to ensure that the new_bases, _class, fields, new_attrs, n, and v are returned with the expected values and types.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super().__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
    new_attrs = {}
    for n, v in attrs.items():
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        else:
            new_attrs[n] = v
            
    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super().__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

By using super() without specifically referring to ItemMeta, we can achieve the desired behavior in the __new__ function. This code should fix the bug and allow for proper inheritance on Item.
