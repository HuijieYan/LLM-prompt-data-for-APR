The potential error in the provided function lies in the second call to `super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)` where it is incorrectly trying to create a new class with its parent class's `__new__` method. This results in a potential infinite recursion.

The bug occurs because the new class is being created with the same metaclass `ItemMeta` as its parent class. This causes the `__new__` method to be called again, leading to an infinite recursion.

To fix the bug, the new class should use the metaclass of its parent class instead of explicitly using the `ItemMeta` metaclass.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class ItemMeta(ABCMeta):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
        new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
        _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)
    
        fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
        new_attrs = {}
        for n in dir(_class):
            v = getattr(_class, n)
            if isinstance(v, Field):
                fields[n] = v
            elif n in attrs:
                new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]
    
        new_attrs['fields'] = fields
        new_attrs['_class'] = _class
        return type(class_name, new_bases, new_attrs)  # using type() to create the new class with the correct metaclass
```
