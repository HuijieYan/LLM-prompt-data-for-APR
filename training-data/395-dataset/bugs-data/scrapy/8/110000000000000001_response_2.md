The potential error in the given function is the incorrect usage of the `__new__` method. It looks like the intention is to create a metaclass that modifies the attributes of a class based on the fields defined in that class.

The bug in the provided function is that it incorrectly calls `super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)` at the end of the function. This will lead to an infinite recursive call to `__new__`.

To fix the bug, we need to call `__new__` method of the metaclass's superclass and then manually modify the attributes before returning the updated class.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    new_class = super().__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = getattr(new_class, 'fields', {})
    for n in dir(new_class):
        v = getattr(new_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
            
    new_class.fields = fields
    return new_class
```

In this corrected version, we create a new class using `super().__new__` and then modify the attributes of the new class without making a recursive call to `__new__` again.
