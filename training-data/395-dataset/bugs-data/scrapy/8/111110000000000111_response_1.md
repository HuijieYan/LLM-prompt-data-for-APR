Potential Error Location: The error is likely occurring in the __new__ method of the ItemMeta class.

Reasons for the Bug: The bug seems to be related to the way the new class is being created and the inheritance of fields from the base classes.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the new class is created with the correct bases and attributes.
2. Make sure to properly inherit fields from the base classes and update the fields in the new class accordingly.

Corrected Code:

```python
class ItemMeta(ABCMeta):
    def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
        new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))

        # Create the new class with the updated bases and attributes
        _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

        fields = {}
        for base in new_bases:
            fields.update(getattr(base, 'fields', {}))

        fields.update({name: value for name, value in attrs.items() if isinstance(value, Field)})
        _class.fields = fields

        return _class
```
