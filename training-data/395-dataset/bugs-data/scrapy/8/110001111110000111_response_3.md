The error message indicates that the `ItemMeta` class is not being properly instantiated, which results in a TypeError when trying to use inheritance on the `Item`. The error occurs when the `new_attrs` dictionary is being returned after being modified with the fields and `_class` attributes.

The bug is likely to be in the following line:
```python
return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```
This line is incorrectly calling `__new__` on the wrong class and is not passing the correct arguments.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is the incorrect use of the super function and the wrong passing of arguments when calling the `__new__` method.

To fix the bug, we need to call `__new__` method of the super class `type` with the correct arguments.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super().__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return type.__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```
