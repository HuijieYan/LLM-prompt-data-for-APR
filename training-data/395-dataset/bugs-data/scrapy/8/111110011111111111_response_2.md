The buggy function `__new__` within the `ItemMeta` class is not properly handling the class creation process. It is attempting to modify the class attributes and create a new class with modified attributes, but in doing so, it is encountering errors.

The error message from the test function specifically mentions that the `__class__` is being set incorrectly. This suggests that the class creation process is not being handled properly.

One potential approach for fixing the bug is to modify the way the new class is being created and handled within the `__new__` method. Additionally, the code that modifies the class attributes should be reviewed to ensure it is not causing any conflicts during the class creation process.

Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` method:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return type(class_name, new_bases, new_attrs)
```

In the corrected code, the new class is created using the `type` function instead of using `super` to create a new instance of the metaclass. Additionally, the class attributes are modified appropriately before creating the new class.

With these corrections, the bug should be fixed and the error should no longer occur.
