The error message from the test function indicates that the class `MyItem` is not being created properly when using inheritance with the `Item` class. The error message "TypeError: __class__ set to <class '__main__.MyItem'> defining 'MyItem' as <class '__main__.MyItem'>" suggests that there is an issue with setting the class for `MyItem`.

The potential error location within the function is in the line `super(MyItem, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)` where the class `MyItem` is being passed as an argument to `super()`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `ItemMeta` class (which `Item` uses for metaclass) is not correctly handling class inheritance. The metaclass is responsible for creating the classes with the correct inheritance hierarchy.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the `ItemMeta` class to correctly handle class inheritance. This can be done by properly setting the class for `MyItem` and ensuring that the inheritance hierarchy is correctly handled.

```python
class ItemMeta(type):

    def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
        if not any(isinstance(base, ItemMeta) for base in bases):
            return type.__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs)

        fields = {}
        for base in bases:
            if hasattr(base, 'fields'):
                fields.update(base.fields)

        for name, value in attrs.items():
            if isinstance(value, Field):
                fields[name] = value

        new_class = type.__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs)
        new_class.fields = fields
        return new_class
```

With this corrected `ItemMeta` class, the bug related to Python 3.6 Item inheritance should be fixed. This revised code properly handles class inheritance and ensures that the class hierarchy is correctly established.
