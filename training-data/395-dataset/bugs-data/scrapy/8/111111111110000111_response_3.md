The error message indicates that there is a problem with the class inheritance and the `ItemMeta` metaclass. The error seems to be related to the `__class__` attribute being set incorrectly during inheritance.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the last line where `ItemMeta` is being called to create a new class. It seems that the `__class__` attribute is being set incorrectly here.

The bug occurs because the `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` metaclass is not correctly handling the inheritance and creation of new classes. It seems to be overriding the `__class__` attribute without properly setting it.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `__class__` attribute is set correctly during the creation of a new class. This can be done by adjusting the logic in the `__new__` method to handle inheritance and class creation properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` method:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return type(class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

With this corrected code, the `__class__` attribute should be set correctly during class creation, and the inheritance should work as expected without raising the `TypeError` mentioned in the test function.
