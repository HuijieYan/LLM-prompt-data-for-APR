The error message is indicating that the `MyItem` class is not being defined properly due to an issue with the `ItemMeta` metaclass. This suggests that the problem lies within the `ItemMeta` class.

Upon analyzing the code, the issue seems to be with the return value of the `__new__` method in the `ItemMeta` class. The function is attempting to modify the class attributes and return a new class definition, but it is not doing so correctly, leading to the error.

The bug is occurring because the `__new__` method is not properly creating a new class with the modified attributes. Instead, it is returning a new class with the original attributes.

To fix this issue, the `__new__` method should correctly modify the class attributes and then return the new class definition with these modified attributes.

Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` method:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(mcs):
        v = getattr(mcs, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            new_attrs[n] = v
    new_attrs['_class'] = mcs
    return super().__new__(mcs, class_name, new_bases, new_attrs)
```

In the corrected code, we correctly modify the class attributes and return the new class definition with these modifications. This should resolve the issue with the `ItemMeta` metaclass and the `MyItem` class definition.
