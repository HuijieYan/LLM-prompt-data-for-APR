Potential error location:
The error is occurring in the test function `test_item_meta_classcell_regression` when trying to define the `MyItem` class using `six.with_metaclass(ItemMeta, Item)`. This error is likely due to the problematic function `__new__` in the `ItemMeta` class.

Reasons for the bug:
The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect manipulation of class inheritance and attribute merging within the `ItemMeta` class `__new__` function. This leads to issues with the class definition and attribute inheritance, resulting in the error during the test case.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure proper handling of class inheritance and attribute merging.
2. Create the new class with the correct inheritance and attributes.
3. Correctly initialize the class with `super()`.

Corrected code for the problematic function `__new__`:

```python
class ItemMeta(ABCMeta):
    def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
        new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
        _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

        fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
        new_attrs = {}
        for n in dir(_class):
            v = getattr(_class, n)
            if isinstance(v, Field):
                fields[n] = v
            elif n in attrs:
                new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

        new_attrs['fields'] = fields
        new_attrs['_class'] = _class
        return type(class_name, new_bases, new_attrs)
```
