The buggy code is a metaclass with a `__new__` method that processes the input attributes and generates corresponding new base classes and attributes. The issue arises from the use of two different `__new__` methods within the same method, which results in incorrect handling of attributes and bases and the ultimately incorrect return value. 

The `__new__` method is called for two different purposes, resulting in two different return values. 

To fix this, the redundant generation of a new class should be removed, and the logic for updating attributes and bases should be adjusted accordingly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from abc import ABCMeta

class ItemMeta(ABCMeta):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
        new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    
        fields = getattr(mcs, 'fields', {})
        new_attrs = {}
        for n in attrs:
            v = attrs[n]
            if isinstance(v, Field):
                fields[n] = v
            else:
                new_attrs[n] = v
    
        new_attrs['fields'] = fields
        new_attrs['_class'] = mcs
        new_attrs['__module__'] = attrs.get('__module__', None)
        return super().__new__(mcs, class_name, new_bases, new_attrs)
```

In this corrected code, the redundant class creation is removed, and the attribute processing logic has been adjusted to correctly update the attribute dictionary. The method returns the newly updated attributes dictionary in the end. Also, the `__module__` attribute is properly extracted from the `attrs` input dictionary to ensure it is retained in the `new_attrs`.
