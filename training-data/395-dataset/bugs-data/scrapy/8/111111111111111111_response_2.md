This bug occurs when trying to use inheritance on the `Item` class. The bug is likely due to incorrect handling of the class cell in the `ItemMeta` metaclass when creating a new class.

To fix this bug, the metaclass `ItemMeta` needs to handle the class cell properly when creating a new class.

Here's the corrected code for the `ItemMeta` metaclass:

```python
class ItemMeta(ABCMeta):
    def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
        new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
        _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

        fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
        new_attrs = {}
        for n in dir(_class):
            v = getattr(_class, n)
            if isinstance(v, Field):
                fields[n] = v
            elif n in attrs:
                new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

        new_attrs['fields'] = fields
        new_attrs['_class'] = _class

        classcell = attrs.get('__classcell__', None)

        if classcell is not None:
            new_attrs['__classcell__'] = classcell

        return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

This code ensures that the `classcell` is properly handled when creating the new class. This should fix the inheritance bug that was occurring.
