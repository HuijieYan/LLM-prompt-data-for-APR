The potential error in the provided code is that the `__new__` method is being called with the wrong arguments for the class creation. This could be the reason behind the TypeError when trying to use inheritance on Item.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `__new__` method is called correctly to create the class with the proper bases and attributes.

Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` method:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class ItemMeta(ABCMeta):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # corrected __new__ method
    def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
        new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
        _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

        fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
        new_attrs = {}
        for n in dir(_class):
            v = getattr(_class, n)
            if isinstance(v, Field):
                fields[n] = v
            elif n in attrs:
                new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

        new_attrs['fields'] = fields
        new_attrs['_class'] = _class
        return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, new_attrs)  # corrected usage of __new__
```

In the corrected code, the `__new__` method is called with the correct arguments for creating the class, ensuring that the bases and attributes are correctly passed to the superclass's `__new__` method. This should resolve the issue with inheritance failing and the TypeError encountered when using inheritance on Item.
