The issue here seems to be with the usage of the `__new__` method in the `ItemMeta` class. It tries to create a new class based on the provided `class_name`, `bases`, and `attrs`. However, it incorrectly handles the `bases` and does not properly process the `fields` and `new_attrs`.

The error message indicates that there is an issue with setting the `__class__` attribute, which is likely due to the incorrect handling of the bases and the new class creation.

To fix this issue, the `__new__` method should correctly process the `bases` and properly handle the creation of the new class. It should also correctly update the `fields` and `new_attrs`.

Here's the corrected `__new__` method for the `ItemMeta` class:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
    new_attrs = {}
    for n, v in attrs.items():
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        else:
            new_attrs[n] = v

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return type(class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

This corrected method processes the `attrs` dictionary correctly to update the `fields` and `new_attrs` with the appropriate values. Additionally, it uses the `type` function to properly create the new class based on the provided `class_name`, `bases`, and `new_attrs`.
