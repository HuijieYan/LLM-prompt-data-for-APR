The error message indicates that the class creation is failing with the `TypeError` due to incorrect propagation of the `__classcell__`. This issue occurs because the `__classcell__` is not being handled properly within the `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` class.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `__classcell__` is handled correctly in the `__new__` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` method:

```python
class ItemMeta(ABCMeta):
    def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
        new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
        _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

        fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
        new_attrs = {}
        for n in dir(_class):
            v = getattr(_class, n)
            if isinstance(v, Field):
                fields[n] = v
            elif n in attrs:
                new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

        new_attrs['fields'] = fields
        new_attrs['_class'] = _class

        # Fixes the issue with __classcell__ propagation
        if '__classcell__' in attrs:
            new_attrs['__classcell__'] = attrs['__classcell__']

        return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

In this corrected code, if the `__classcell__` attribute is present in the `attrs`, it is explicitly added to the `new_attrs`. This ensures that the `__classcell__` is propagated correctly.

With this fix, the `TypeError` related to `__classcell__` propagation should be resolved, and the test case should pass without any errors.

Additionally, it's important to test these changes thoroughly to ensure that they do not cause any regressions in functionality.
