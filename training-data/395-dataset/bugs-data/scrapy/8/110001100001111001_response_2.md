The bug in the provided code is in the way the new_attrs dictionary is created. This dictionary should include only the field attributes from the base classes, but the current logic includes all attributes from the attrs dictionary as well.

To fix this bug, we should iterate through the base classes to retrieve their field attributes and add them to the new_attrs dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
    new_attrs = {}
    for base_class in bases:
        for n in dir(base_class):
            v = getattr(base_class, n)
            if n != 'fields' and isinstance(v, Field):
                fields[n] = v
            elif n in attrs:
                new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, new_bases, new_attrs)
```
