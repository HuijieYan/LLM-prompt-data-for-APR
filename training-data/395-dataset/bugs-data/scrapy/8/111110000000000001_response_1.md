Potential error location: 
The bug is most likely in the last line of the function where the `__new__` method is being called recursively, potentially causing an infinite loop.

Reasons behind the bug:
The `__new__` method is responsible for creating a new instance of a class, and in this case, it is expected to create a new class based on the input parameters. However, the current implementation is flawed because it calls `__new__` recursively without any condition to terminate the process. This will result in an infinite loop and eventual stack overflow.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to rewrite the logic of the `__new__` method to achieve the desired functionality without causing an infinite loop. One approach could be to modify the conditional statements and the way the new class is created. Additionally, we need to ensure that the new class is properly constructed without invoking `__new__` in a way that leads to a recursive call.

Corrected code:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class ItemMeta(ABCMeta):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # corrected __new__ method
    def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
        new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
        _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

        fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
        new_attrs = {}
        for n in dir(_class):
            v = getattr(_class, n)
            if isinstance(v, Field):
                fields[n] = v
            elif n in attrs:
                new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

        new_attrs['fields'] = fields
        new_attrs['_class'] = _class
        return type(class_name, new_bases, new_attrs)
```
