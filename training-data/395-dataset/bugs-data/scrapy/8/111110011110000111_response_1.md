The error message indicates that the issue occurs when creating a new class `MyItem` using `six.with_metaclass(ItemMeta, Item)`.

The bug in the provided function `__new__` is that it's creating a new class with modified bases and attributes, but in doing so, it's not updating the class name. This leads to the `TypeError` when trying to instantiate a new class with the same name as the original class.

To fix the bug, we need to update the class name when creating the new class with modified bases and attributes.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class ItemMeta(ABCMeta):
    def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
        new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
        _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

        fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
        new_attrs = {}
        for n in dir(_class):
            v = getattr(_class, n)
            if isinstance(v, Field):
                fields[n] = v
            elif n in attrs:
                new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

        new_attrs['fields'] = fields
        new_attrs['_class'] = _class
        return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, new_attrs)
```

In the corrected code, the class name is updated by prepending 'x_' to the original `class_name` when creating a new class with modified bases and attributes. This will ensure that the new class has a unique name and won't cause any conflicts or `TypeError` when instantiating a new class.
