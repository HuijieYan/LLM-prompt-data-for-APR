The error in the provided code is that the overridden `__new__` method of the metaclass `ItemMeta` is not handling the class creation process correctly. The `__new__` method should return a class object, but in the provided code, it is returning the result of a call to another `__new__` method of the metaclass. This will lead to unexpected behavior.

The bug occurs because the return value of the overridden `__new__` method is not correctly constructed as a new class object based on the input parameters.

One possible fix for the bug is to create a new class object with the provided attributes, and bases and then update the attributes and fields of this class. Finally, return the newly created class object.

Here is the corrected code for the `__new__` method:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
    new_attrs = attrs.copy()

    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return type(class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

In the corrected code, a new class object is created using `type()`, and then the `fields` and other necessary attributes are updated before returning the new class object. This fix should resolve the TypeError related to class creation.
