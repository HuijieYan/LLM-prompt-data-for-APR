The problem in the provided code is that the `__new__` method is attempting to create a new class with modified attributes without properly handling the classcell propagation requirement. This is leading to the TypeError in the test case.

The error message specifically mentions that the `__class__` is set to a different value than expected, leading to the definition of 'MyItem' as a different class than intended.

To fix this issue, the modified `__new__` method should properly handle classcell propagation by using the super() call to create the new class.

Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` method:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super().__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super().__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

With this correction, the `__new__` method properly handles the creation of the new class while ensuring that the classcell propagation requirement is met. This should resolve the TypeError mentioned in the test case.
