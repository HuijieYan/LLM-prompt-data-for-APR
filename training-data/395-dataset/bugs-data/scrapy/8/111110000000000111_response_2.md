The potential error location within the problematic function is the second call to `super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)`. This call should be calling the `__new__` method of the superclass, but it's currently calling the `__new__` method of the current class.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the second call to `__new__` should be calling the superclass's method to properly create the new class, but it's currently calling itself, leading to unexpected behavior and the error message.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to replace the second call to `__new__` with a call to `super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, new_bases, new_attrs)` to properly call the superclass's method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class ItemMeta(ABCMeta):
    # ... omitted code ...


    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
        new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
        _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)
    
        fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
        new_attrs = {}
        for n in dir(_class):
            v = getattr(_class, n)
            if isinstance(v, Field):
                fields[n] = v
            elif n in attrs:
                new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]
    
        new_attrs['fields'] = fields
        new_attrs['_class'] = _class
        return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, new_bases, new_attrs)
```
