Potential error location: The error is occurring in the class declaration of MyItem, where the item is being defined using the ItemMeta metaclass. The error message suggests that the __class__ is being set to a different class than expected.

Reasons behind the bug: The buggy function is not handling the creation of the new class with the correct attributes and bases, which is causing the incorrect assignment of the __class__.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Ensure that the new class is created with the correct bases and attributes.
2. Take into account the metaclass and its behavior when creating the new class.
3. Update the bases and attributes of the new class according to the expectation of the metaclass.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```Python
# corrected function
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    new_attrs = {}
    fields = {}

    for base in new_bases:
        if hasattr(base, 'fields'):
            fields.update(getattr(base, 'fields'))

    for attr_name, attr_value in attrs.items():
        if isinstance(attr_value, Field):
            fields[attr_name] = attr_value
        else:
            new_attrs[attr_name] = attr_value

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields

    return super().__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```
