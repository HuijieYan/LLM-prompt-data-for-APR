The error occurs because the `__new__` method is not implemented correctly. This method is supposed to create a new instance of a class, and it seems like the intention is to modify some attributes before creating the new class.

The bug occurs because in the first return statement, `mcs` is passed instead of `class_name`. Also, in the second return statement, the parameters are not used correctly.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to use the correct parameters and implement the method to create a new class and modify its attributes as needed.

Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` method:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return type(class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

This correction ensures that the correct parameters are used in creating and returning the new class.
