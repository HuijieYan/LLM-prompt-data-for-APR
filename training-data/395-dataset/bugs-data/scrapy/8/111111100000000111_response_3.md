Potential error location: The error likely occurs in the  `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` class in the provided code.

Reasons behind the bug: The `__new__` method is not handling the class inheritance properly. It seems to be trying to transform the class name and bases without considering the inheritance hierarchy correctly.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: The `__new__` method should be modified to handle class inheritance properly and to correctly set the class name and bases when creating a new class.

Corrected code:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return type(class_name, new_bases, new_attrs)
```
