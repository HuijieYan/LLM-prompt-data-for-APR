The error message indicates that the `TypeError` is being raised when the test case tries to create an instance of `MyItem`, a class that is using `six.with_metaclass(ItemMeta, Item)`.

The potential error in the problematic function is that it is not correctly handling the creation of the new class with metaclass. It is modifying the attributes of the class incorrectly and returning a new class with metaclass. This incorrect handling leads to the propagation of the class cell and results in the `TypeError` when creating an instance of the class.

The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of class creation with metaclass, which leads to the propagation of the class cell and results in the `TypeError`.

To fix the bug, the problematic function needs to correctly handle the creation of the new class with the given metaclass and avoid modifying the class attributes in an incorrect way.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, dict(attrs))
    fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
    for base in bases:
        base_fields = getattr(base, 'fields', {})
        fields.update(base_fields)
    for n, v in attrs.items():
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
    _class.fields = fields
    return _class
```

In the corrected code, the function creates the new class using the given metaclass, correctly handles the base classes and their fields, and then returns the new class. This approach avoids the propagation of the class cell and should fix the `TypeError` that was occurring.
