The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of `super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)` in the last line of the function. It seems that the intention is to create a new class based on the provided class name, bases, and new attributes. 

The error is likely occurring due to incorrect usage of the `super()` function. The superclass should be the class's immediate parent, but in this case, it's being used with `ItemMeta` instead of the immediate parent class.

To fix the bug, we should use `super().__new__()` instead of `super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__()`.

Corrected code:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super().__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super().__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```
