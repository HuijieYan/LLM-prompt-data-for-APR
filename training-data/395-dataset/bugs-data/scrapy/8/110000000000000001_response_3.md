Potential error location: The error is likely occurring due to incorrect usage of the `__new__` method for a metaclass. The code is attempting to modify the attributes and bases of the class before returning a new class instance.

Reasons behind the bug: The `__new__` method is not being used correctly for a metaclass. The modification of bases and attributes is causing the error, and the return statement is also incorrect.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the creation of the new class instance and modifications to its attributes and bases.

Corrected code:

```python
# corrected method
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    fields = {k: v for k, v in attrs.items() if isinstance(v, Field)}
    attrs['fields'] = fields
    
    return super().__new__(mcs, class_name, new_bases, attrs)
```
