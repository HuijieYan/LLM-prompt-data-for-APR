The buggy function is a metaclass method called `__new__` inside the `ItemMeta` class. This method is responsible for creating a new instance of the metaclass. The bug seems to be that the new instance is not being created correctly, as it is not using the arguments provided.

The reason behind the bug is that the function is not using the arguments `class_name`, `bases`, and `attrs` properly. It is creating a new instance with hard-coded values instead of using the provided arguments.

One approach to fixing the bug is by using the provided arguments to create the new instance instead of hard-coding values. It seems like a mistake in the logic and incorrect usage of the provided arguments.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super().__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in attrs.keys():
        v = attrs.get(n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super().__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```
