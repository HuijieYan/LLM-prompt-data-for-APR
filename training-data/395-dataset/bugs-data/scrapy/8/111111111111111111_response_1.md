The bug occurs when the `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` class is called. The bug is likely due to the incorrect construction of the new_attrs dictionary, resulting in an incorrect return value.

It seems that the `__new__` method is trying to create a new class based on the provided inputs. However, the construction of the `new_attrs` dictionary seems to be incorrect, and the way `bases` are handled in certain cases may be causing the issue.

To fix the bug, the `__new__` method should construct the `new_attrs` dictionary carefully, ensuring all necessary attributes are included, and should handle the `bases` properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` method:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    for n, v in attrs.items():
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v

    new_attrs = attrs.copy()
    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return _class
```

In this corrected code, we construct the `fields` dictionary and then copy the original `attrs` into `new_attrs`, adding the `fields` and `_class` entries.

This should fix the bug and the associated error message.
