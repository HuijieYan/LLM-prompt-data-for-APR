The potential error in the buggy function is that the function is not properly handling inheritance of the `Item` class. It is trying to create a new class by appending 'x_' to the original class name and then adding the fields from the parent class. However, the implementation is incorrect and is causing the TypeError mentioned in the GitHub issue.

The bug occurs because the function is trying to handle inheritance manually without properly utilizing the features provided by Python for class inheritance. Instead of creating a new class by manipulating the class name, it should simply call the superclass `__new__` method and let Python handle the inheritance.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to remove the manual handling of class inheritance and call the superclass `__new__` method with the appropriate arguments.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_8/scrapy/item.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super().__new__(mcs, class_name, new_bases, attrs)
    
    fields = {}
    for base in bases:
        fields.update(getattr(base, 'fields', {}))
        
    for n, v in attrs.items():
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
            
    _class.fields = fields
    _class._class = _class
    
    return _class
```
