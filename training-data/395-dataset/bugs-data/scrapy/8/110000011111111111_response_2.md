The error occurs when the `Item` class is being used as a metaclass. The issue is that the `__new__` method of the metaclass is not properly processing the input and returning the correct output. As a result, the `TypeError` is raised when trying to use inheritance with `Item`.

To fix this bug, the `__new__` method needs to be modified to correctly process the input parameters and return the expected output. One way to do this is to update the logic for handling the input parameters and creating the new class using the `super()` function.

Here's the corrected `__new__` method:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    new_class = super().__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = getattr(new_class, 'fields', {})
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(new_class):
        v = getattr(new_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = new_class

    return type.__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

In this corrected method, `super().__new__` is used to create the new class, and the input parameters (`class_name`, `bases`, and `attrs`) are properly processed to create the expected output.

This should resolve the `TypeError` and allow for proper inheritance with `Item` as the metaclass.
