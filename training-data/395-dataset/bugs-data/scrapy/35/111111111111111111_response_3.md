The error occurs because the `runner.spider_loader` is not an instance of `CustomSpiderLoader` as expected, but an instance of `scrapy.spiderloader.SpiderLoader`. This indicates that the `_get_spider_loader` function is not returning the expected spider loader class based on the settings.

The potential error location within the function is the line `cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS', settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'))`. This line is supposed to retrieve the spider loader class path from the settings, but it seems to be picking up the wrong class path.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not correctly retrieving the spider loader class path from the settings, which leads to the wrong class being instantiated.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the correct spider loader class path is retrieved from the settings. We also need to ensure that the correct class is instantiated based on the retrieved class path.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_spider_loader` function:

```python
from scrapy.utils.misc import load_object
from scrapy.interfaces import ISpiderLoader
from scrapy.exceptions import ScrapyDeprecationWarning
import warnings

def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS')
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```

In this corrected code, we directly retrieve the spider loader class path from the 'SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS' setting, instead of falling back to 'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'. This ensures that the correct class path is used.
