The error message from the test function indicates that the `runner.spider_loader` is not an instance of `CustomSpiderLoader` as expected. This suggests that the `_get_spider_loader` function is not returning the correct loader instance.

The potential error location within the `_get_spider_loader` function could be in the line where `loader_cls` is being instantiated. It seems that the `load_object` function might not be returning the correct instance.

The bug occurred because the function was not correctly instantiating the desired `SpiderLoader` class based on the provided settings. This led to the test case failing when it expected the `runner.spider_loader` to be an instance of `CustomSpiderLoader`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct `SpiderLoader` class is instantiated based on the settings provided.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import warnings
from scrapy.exceptions import ScrapyDeprecationWarning
from scrapy.spiderloader import SpiderLoader
from scrapy.utils.misc import load_object
from zope.interface.verify import verifyClass
from scrapy.interfaces import ISpiderLoader

def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS',
                            settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'))
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls.from_settings(settings)
```

In the corrected code, we import the necessary modules and the `SpiderLoader` class. We then use the `from_settings` method of the `loader_cls` to instantiate the correct `SpiderLoader` instance based on the provided settings.

This should fix the bug and ensure that the `_get_spider_loader` function returns the correct `SpiderLoader` instance.
