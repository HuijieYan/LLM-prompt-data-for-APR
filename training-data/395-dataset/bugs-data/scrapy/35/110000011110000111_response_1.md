1. The test case `test_spidermanager_deprecation` is attempting to create a `CrawlerRunner` with the `SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS` set to 'tests.test_crawler.CustomSpiderLoader'. It then checks if the `runner.spider_loader` is an instance of `CustomSpiderLoader`, but the assertion fails.

2. The potential error location is within the `_get_spider_loader` function, specifically when the `loader_cls` is being loaded and returned.

3. The reason behind the bug is that the `_get_spider_loader` function is not properly handling the deprecation of the `SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS` option. It should use the new `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS` option instead.

4. To fix the bug, we can modify the `_get_spider_loader` function to handle the deprecation warning and use the correct class based on the settings.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import warnings

def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS')
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```

In the corrected code, the `loader_cls` is retrieved directly from the `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS` setting, and the deprecation warning is issued if `SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS` is still present in the settings. This should resolve the issue encountered in the test case.
