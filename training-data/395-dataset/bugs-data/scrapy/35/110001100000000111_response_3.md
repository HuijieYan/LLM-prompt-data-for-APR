The potential bug in the provided function is the use of the deprecated 'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS' option and the warning associated with it. The function also appears to be using the deprecated 'load_object' and 'verifyClass' methods, which may also cause issues.

To fix the bug, the following steps can be taken:
1. Replace the usage of 'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS' with the new 'SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS'.
2. Update the warning message accordingly.
3. Replace the usage of 'load_object' with the new method for loading the class.
4. Replace the usage of 'verifyClass' with the new method for class verification.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import warnings

def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS option is deprecated.',
            category=DeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS',
                            settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'))
    loader_cls = load_spider_loader_class(cls_path)  # replace with the actual method for loading the spider loader class
    verify_spider_loader_class(loader_cls)  # replace with the actual method for class verification
    return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```

In the corrected code, I've replaced the deprecated 'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS' with 'SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS', updated the warning message, and replaced the usage of 'load_object' and 'verifyClass' with the appropriate methods for loading and verifying the spider loader class.
