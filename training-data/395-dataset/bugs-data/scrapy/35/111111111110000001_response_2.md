The error message indicates that the `runner.spider_loader` object is not an instance of `CustomSpiderLoader`, which is expected according to the test case.

The potential error location in the function is the line:
```python
loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```
The `from_settings` method might not be returning the expected type of `loader_cls`.

The bug occurs because the `from_settings` method might not be returning an instance of `CustomSpiderLoader` as expected in the test case.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to directly instantiate the `loader_cls` class using the `settings` as follows:
```python
return loader_cls(settings)
```

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS',
                            settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'))
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls(settings)
```
