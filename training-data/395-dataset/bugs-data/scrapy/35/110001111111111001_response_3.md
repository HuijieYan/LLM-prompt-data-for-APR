The test case 'test_spidermanager_deprecation' is trying to check if 'runner.spider_loader' is an instance of 'CustomSpiderLoader', but it fails with an AssertionError. This suggests that the 'runner.spider_loader' is not being set correctly.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line:
```python
return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```

The error occurs because the 'loader_cls' is an instance of 'CustomSpiderLoader' instead of 'SpiderLoader', which is the expected behavior.

The bug occurs because the 'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS' setting is being used to instantiate the spider loader, and it's deprecated. It should be using 'SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS' instead.

To fix the bug, we should update the function to use the 'SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS' setting to instantiate the loader_cls.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS')
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```
