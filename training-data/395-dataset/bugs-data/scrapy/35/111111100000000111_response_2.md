Potential error location: The potential error lies in the way the `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS` is obtained from the settings and used to instantiate the loader_cls.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug is caused by the deprecated `SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS` option, which has been replaced with `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS`. The function is still using the old option, leading to a deprecation warning.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Update the function to use the new `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS` option and remove the usage of deprecated `SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS`. Additionally, update the function to handle the deprecation warning properly without causing any errors in the code.

Corrected code:

```python
def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS'):
        cls_path = settings['SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS']
    else:
        cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS')
        if cls_path:
            warnings.warn(
                'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
                'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
                category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
            )
    
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```

This corrected code checks for the existence of `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS` in the settings and falls back to using `SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS` if it is not found, while issuing the deprecation warning.
