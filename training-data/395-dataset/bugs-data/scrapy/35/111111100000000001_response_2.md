Potential error location: 
The error is likely in the last line of the function, where it tries to call `settings.frozencopy()` to create a copy of the settings. 

Reasons behind the bug: 
The `frozencopy()` method does not exist in the settings object, which leads to a AttributeError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Instead of `settings.frozencopy()`, use `settings.copy()`, which is a built-in method for creating a copy of a dictionary in Python.
2. Handle the case where `SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS` is deprecated and use `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS` accordingly.

Corrected code:
```python
import warnings
from zope.interface.verify import verifyClass
from scrapy.interfaces import ISpiderLoader
from scrapy.utils.misc import load_object

def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS',
                            settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'))
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.copy())
```
