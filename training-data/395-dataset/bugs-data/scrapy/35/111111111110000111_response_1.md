The error message indicates that the `runner.spider_loader` is not an instance of `CustomSpiderLoader`, which is unexpected based on the test case.

The potential error location is within the `_get_spider_loader` function, specifically in the line:
```python
loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
```
It seems that the `load_object` function is not returning the expected `SpiderLoader` class.

The bug occurred because the deprecated `SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS` setting is being used instead of the new `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS` setting, which is causing the incorrect class to be loaded.

To fix the bug, we should use the `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS` setting directly and remove the usage of the deprecated `SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS` setting.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_35/scrapy/crawler.py

# corrected function
def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS')
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```

With this correction, the function will use the new `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS` setting to load the appropriate class, ensuring that the correct class is returned and the bug is fixed.
