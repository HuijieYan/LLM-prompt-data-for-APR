The error occurs in the test function `test_spidermanager_deprecation` where it expects the `runner.spider_loader` to be an instance of `CustomSpiderLoader` but instead it's an instance of `scrapy.spiderloader.SpiderLoader`. This indicates that the function `_get_spider_loader` is not returning the expected `CustomSpiderLoader` instance.

The potential error location within the `_get_spider_loader` function is the line where `loader_cls` is assigned. It is currently fetching the value from settings using `get` method but it should be using the `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS` instead of the deprecated `SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is using the deprecated `SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS` instead of the new `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS` to fetch the loader class path from settings.

To fix the bug, we need to update the line where `cls_path` is assigned to fetch the `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS` from settings.

Also, the warning message should be removed because the usage of `SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS` is deprecated and no warning is required.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import warnings

def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS')
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```

In this corrected code, we fetch the `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS` from settings and use it to get the loader class path.

Additionally, the warning message block should be removed as it's not required anymore.

This correction aligns with the changes made in the GitHub issue titled `[MRG+1] rename SpiderManager to SpiderLoader`.
