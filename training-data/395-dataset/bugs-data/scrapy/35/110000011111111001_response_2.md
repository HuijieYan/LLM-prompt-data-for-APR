The bug is likely located in the `_get_spider_loader` function. It seems that when the `from_settings` method is called on the loader_cls, it is not returning an instance of the `CustomSpiderLoader` as expected but instead returning an instance of `SpiderLoader`.

The reason for this bug is that the `cls_path` variable is being set to `'tests.test_crawler.CustomSpiderLoader'`, but it should instead be set to `'scrapy.spiderloader.SpiderLoader'` to ensure that the correct class is loaded.

To fix this bug, the correct class path should be used to load the SpiderLoader class. The corrected code for the `_get_spider_loader` function is provided below:

```python
def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS', 'scrapy.spiderloader.SpiderLoader')
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```
