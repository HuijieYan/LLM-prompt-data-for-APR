Potential error location:
The error is occurring in the _get_spider_loader function, specifically in the line where it attempts to retrieve the spider loader class from the settings and then instantiate it.

Reasons behind the bug:
The bug is likely caused by the renaming of SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS to SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS, as mentioned in the GitHub issue title and description. The function is still using the old SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS instead of the new SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to retrieve the spider loader class using the correct SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS key from the settings. Additionally, the warning related to the deprecated SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option should be handled appropriately.

Corrected code:
```python
import warnings
from scrapy.utils.misc import load_object
from scrapy.interfaces import ISpiderLoader

def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    deprecated_spider_manager_class = settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS')
    if deprecated_spider_manager_class:
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    loader_cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS', deprecated_spider_manager_class)
    loader_cls = load_object(loader_cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```
