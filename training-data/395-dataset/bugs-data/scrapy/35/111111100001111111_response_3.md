The issue seems to be related to the renaming of the SpiderManager to SpiderLoader within the Scrapy framework. The error message mentions that the SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated and should be replaced with SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.

The buggy function `_get_spider_loader` is trying to retrieve the SpiderLoader instance from the settings. It then checks if SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS exists in the settings and issues a deprecation warning if it does. It then tries to load the SpiderLoader class using the class path from the settings, verifies the class, and returns an instance of the loader class from the settings.

The potential error location is in the line `loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)` because it seems to be loading the wrong class path based on the input settings. This could be due to the renaming of the class from SpiderManager to SpiderLoader.

To fix this bug, we can directly use the correct SpiderLoader class and remove the deprecated SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option from the settings.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_spider_loader` function:

```python
from scrapy.utils.misc import load_object
from scrapy.interfaces import ISpiderLoader
from scrapy.exceptions import ScrapyDeprecationWarning
import warnings

def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    loader_cls = load_object('scrapy.spiderloader.SpiderLoader')  # Use the correct class path
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```

With this corrected code, the function will directly load the correct SpiderLoader class and use it to create an instance from the input settings.
