Potential error location: The error may occur in the line "return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())" because the method "from_settings" does not exist in the "loader_cls" object.

Reason for the bug: The method "from_settings" is not a standard method for a SpiderLoader class. It seems like this method was custom implemented, but it is not a part of the standard SpiderLoader interface.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Instead of calling the "from_settings" method on the loader_cls object, we can directly create an instance of the SpiderLoader class and pass the settings to its constructor.

Corrected code:

```python
from scrapy.spiderloader import SpiderLoader

def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS',
                            settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'))
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return SpiderLoader(settings)
```
