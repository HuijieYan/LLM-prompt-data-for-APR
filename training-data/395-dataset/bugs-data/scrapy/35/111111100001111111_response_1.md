Potential error location: 
The error is likely to be in the line `return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())`. This line is attempting to call the `from_settings` method on the `loader_cls` object, but the `from_settings` method might not be available in the custom `CustomSpiderLoader` class.

Reason behind the bug:
The bug is likely caused by the renaming of the SpiderManager to SpiderLoader in the source code. The `CustomSpiderLoader` class is a custom implementation that might not have been updated to reflect the changes in the SpiderLoader class.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
We need to ensure that the correct SpiderLoader class is being used and that it has the `from_settings` method available. We can modify the `cls_path` value to use the correct SpiderLoader class, and ensure that it has the necessary methods.

Corrected code:

```python
def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    # Assuming that the correct SpiderLoader class is 'scrapy.spiderloader.SpiderLoader'
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS', 'scrapy.spiderloader.SpiderLoader')
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    
    # Checking if the loader_cls has the 'from_settings' method
    if hasattr(loader_cls, 'from_settings'):
        return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
    else:
        raise AttributeError("SpiderLoader class does not have the 'from_settings' method")
```
In the corrected code, we have updated the `cls_path` to use the correct SpiderLoader class. We then verify that the loader_cls implements the ISpiderLoader interface. Finally, we check if the `from_settings` method is available in the loader_cls before calling it, and raise an AttributeError if it's not available.
