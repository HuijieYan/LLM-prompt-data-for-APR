The error occurs because the `runner.spider_loader` is expected to be an instance of `CustomSpiderLoader` but instead, it is an instance of `SpiderLoader`. This is due to the incorrect loading of the `SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS` or `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS` in the `_get_spider_loader` function.

The potential error location is in the `_get_spider_loader` function, where the `cls_path` is being retrieved from settings and used to load the `loader_cls`.

The bug occurred because the function was not using the correct class specified in the settings to load the `loader_cls`. The `SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS` option is deprecated, and it should be using `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS` instead.

To fix the bug, we should make sure that the `cls_path` is retrieved from `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS` if available, otherwise, it should fallback to `SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS') or settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS')
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```
