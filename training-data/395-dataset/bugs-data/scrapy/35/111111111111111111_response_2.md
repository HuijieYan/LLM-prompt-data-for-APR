The error occurs in the test function `test_spidermanager_deprecation`. This test function is trying to check if the `runner.spider_loader` instance is an instance of `CustomSpiderLoader`, but it fails with an assertion error.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `_get_spider_loader` function, specifically in the line `cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS', settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'))`. This line is responsible for determining the class path based on the settings.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not correctly resolving the `SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS` and `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS` settings. It is falling back to the deprecated `SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS` instead of using the new `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct class path is retrieved from the settings and that it instantiates the appropriate class.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import warnings

def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS')  # Always use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```

This correction ensures that the `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS` is always used, and it properly resolves the class path to instantiate the correct class.
