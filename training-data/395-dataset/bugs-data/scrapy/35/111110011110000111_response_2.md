The test case 'test_spidermanager_deprecation' is trying to create a CrawlerRunner instance with the 'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS' set to 'tests.test_crawler.CustomSpiderLoader'. It then checks if the 'runner.spider_loader' is an instance of 'CustomSpiderLoader'. The error message indicates that 'runner.spider_loader' is not an instance of 'CustomSpiderLoader', which suggests that the '_get_spider_loader' function is not returning the expected 'CustomSpiderLoader' instance.

Looking at the code of the '_get_spider_loader' function, the potential error location seems to be in the line where 'loader_cls' is assigned. The function checks for 'SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS' first, and if it's not available, it falls back to 'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'. The error could arise from not finding the correct class path in these settings.

The reason for the bug is that the function is not correctly retrieving the path of the SpiderLoader class from the provided settings. It seems to be using deprecated settings like 'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS' instead of the new 'SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS', which is causing the incorrect class to be loaded.

To fix the bug, the _get_spider_loader function needs to be updated to correctly fetch the SpiderLoader class from the settings using the 'SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS' key. Additionally, it should handle the deprecation warning properly.

Here's the corrected code for the _get_spider_loader function:

```python
import warnings
from scrapy.loader import _get_spider_loader
from scrapy.exceptions import ScrapyDeprecationWarning
from scrapy.interfaces import ISpiderLoader
from scrapy.utils.misc import load_object

def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS')
    if not cls_path:
        cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS')  # fallback to deprecated option
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```

In this corrected code, we have updated the retrieval of the 'cls_path' to prioritize 'SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS' over the deprecated 'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'. We also maintained the fallback to the deprecated option if 'SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS' is not available. The deprecation warning is also being raised properly.
