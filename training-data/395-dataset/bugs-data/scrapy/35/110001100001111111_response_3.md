The potential error location seems to be in the line `return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())` because it is trying to call the `from_settings` method of the `loader_cls` class.

The bug is likely occurring because the `loader_cls` class is not implementing the `from_settings` method, or it is not implementing it correctly. This could be due to a recent renaming of classes and methods, as indicated by the GitHub issue title and description.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to update the `from_settings` method in the `CustomSpiderLoader` class to match the expected behavior of the `SpiderLoader` class. This may involve renaming the method or making other adjustments based on the changes described in the GitHub issue.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS',
                            settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'))
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls(settings)
```

In this corrected code, the `from_settings` method has been replaced with simply instantiating the `loader_cls` with the `settings` as the argument, which is the expected behavior for the `SpiderLoader` class.
