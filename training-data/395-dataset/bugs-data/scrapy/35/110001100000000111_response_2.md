The potential error in the provided function is the usage of deprecated options and classes. 

The function is trying to get the `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS` from settings using `settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS', settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'))`, where if `SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS` is present in settings, it raises a deprecation warning and suggests using `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS` instead. 

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to use `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS` directly and remove any reference to `SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS`.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
import warnings

def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS')
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```

In this corrected function, we have removed the reference to `SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS` and directly used `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS`. We also kept the warning message intact as a reminder to the users about the deprecation.
