The error message from the test function indicates that the `runner.spider_loader` is not an instance of `CustomSpiderLoader` as expected. This suggests that the `loader_cls` returned by the `_get_spider_loader` function is not the correct class.

Upon analyzing the code, it can be observed that the `SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS` option is deprecated and should be replaced with `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS`. The bug occurs because the function is still looking for `SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS` first, and if not found, then it falls back to `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS`. This behavior causes the wrong class to be loaded.

To fix this bug, the code needs to be modified to only look for `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS` option.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import warnings
from scrapy.utils.misc import load_object
from zope.interface.verify import verifyClass
from scrapy.interfaces import ISpiderLoader

def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS')
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```

By modifying the code to only look for `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS`, we ensure that the correct class is loaded, and the bug is fixed.
