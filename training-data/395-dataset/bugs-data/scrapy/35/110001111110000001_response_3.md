Potential Error Location:
The error might be occurring in the `_get_spider_loader` function where the `loader_cls` is being returned. It seems like the `loader_cls` returned by `load_object` is not the correct class instance.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug might be occurring because the `loader_cls` obtained from the settings is not an instance of the expected `CustomSpiderLoader` class. This mismatch in class instances is causing the test case to fail.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the configuration settings to ensure that the correct class path is being provided for the spider loader.
2. Verify that the `load_object` function is correctly instantiating the class based on the provided class path.

Corrected Code:
```python
# Corrected _get_spider_loader function
def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS',
                            settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'))
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls()

# Updated test function to use the corrected code
def test_spidermanager_deprecation(self):
    with warnings.catch_warnings(record=True) as w:
        runner = CrawlerRunner({
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS': 'tests.test_crawler.CustomSpiderLoader'
        })
        self.assertIsInstance(runner.spider_loader, load_object('tests.test_crawler.CustomSpiderLoader'))
        self.assertEqual(len(w), 1)
        self.assertIn('Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS', str(w[0].message))
