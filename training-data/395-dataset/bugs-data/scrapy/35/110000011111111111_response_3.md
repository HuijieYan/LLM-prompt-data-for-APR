The error occurs because the `loader_cls` is being instantiated with the class `CustomSpiderLoader` instead of `SpiderLoader`, which is the expected behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `get_spider_loader` function to use the correct class and settings. The function should be updated to use the `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS` setting if available, and fall back to the deprecated `SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS` setting. Additionally, the `loader_cls` should be instantiated with the correct class based on the settings.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_spider_loader` function:

```python
import warnings
from scrapy.exceptions import ScrapyDeprecationWarning
from scrapy.interfaces import ISpiderLoader
from scrapy.utils.misc import load_object

def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS', 'scrapy.spiderloader.SpiderLoader')
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```

With this correction, the function will correctly use the `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS` setting and instantiate the `SpiderLoader` class as expected.

This should resolve the error in the test case, and the test should pass without any issues.
