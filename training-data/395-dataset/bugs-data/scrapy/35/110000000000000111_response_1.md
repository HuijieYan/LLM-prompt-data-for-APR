The potential error in the provided function is that it is not correctly handling the deprecated SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option and is not using the correct settings for the SpiderLoader instance.

The reason behind the bug is that the function is checking for the deprecated SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option and warning about it, but it is not using the correct settings for the SpiderLoader class.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to use the correct settings for the SpiderLoader class and remove the warning for the deprecated SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import warnings
from scrapy.utils.misc import load_object
from scrapy.interfaces import ISpiderLoader

def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS')
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```

In this corrected code, we remove the check for the deprecated SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option and directly use the correct settings for the SpiderLoader class to instantiate the loader_cls.
