The error message suggests that the `runner.spider_loader` object is an instance of `scrapy.spiderloader.SpiderLoader` instead of `tests.test_crawler.CustomSpiderLoader`. 

The potential error location within the function `_get_spider_loader(settings)` is the line where it returns `loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())`. It seems that the function is returning an instance of `scrapy.spiderloader.SpiderLoader` instead of `tests.test_crawler.CustomSpiderLoader`.

The bug occurred because the function `_get_spider_loader(settings)` is not correctly retrieving the spider loader class from the settings. This leads to the wrong class being instantiated, resulting in the test failure.

To fix the bug, the function `_get_spider_loader(settings)` needs to be modified to correctly retrieve and instantiate the spider loader class from the settings. 

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected function
def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS',
                            settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'))
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls(settings)
```

In the corrected code, we are instantiating the loader class directly from the retrieved class path and settings. This should ensure that the correct spider loader class is instantiated as expected.
