The error occurs in the test case "test_spidermanager_deprecation" where it is expected that the "runner.spider_loader" should be an instance of "CustomSpiderLoader", but it is actually an instance of "scrapy.spiderloader.SpiderLoader".

The potential error location within the `_get_spider_loader` function is the line `loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())` where it is trying to create an instance of the loader class using the `from_settings` method.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the loader class is not being correctly instantiated from the settings provided.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to import the correct SpiderLoader class from the correct module and use it instead of the custom one. This will ensure that the correct SpiderLoader class is instantiated from the settings.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_spider_loader` function:

```python
from scrapy.spiderloader import SpiderLoader

def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS',
                            settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'))
    
    # Use the correct SpiderLoader class
    loader_cls = SpiderLoader
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```

By using the correct SpiderLoader class from the "scrapy.spiderloader" module, we ensure that the correct class is instantiated from the settings, resolving the bug.
