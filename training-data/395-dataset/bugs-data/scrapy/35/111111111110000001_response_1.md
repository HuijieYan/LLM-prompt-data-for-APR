Potential error location: Based on the error message, the issue seems to be with the creation of the `runner` object in the test function. It is trying to access an attribute `spider_loader` and expects it to be an instance of `CustomSpiderLoader`, but it is not.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug is likely occurring because the `_get_spider_loader` function is not returning an instance of `CustomSpiderLoader` as expected. This means that the function is not properly loading the custom spider loader class specified in the settings.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The `_get_spider_loader` function needs to be modified to properly load the custom spider loader class specified in the settings. This may involve checking the `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS` setting and using it to instantiate the correct loader class.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS')
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls(settings)
```

In the corrected code, the `cls_path` is set directly to the value of `settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS')` without a fallback to `settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS')`. Additionally, the `loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())` is replaced with `return loader_cls(settings)` to create an instance of the loader class using the provided settings.
