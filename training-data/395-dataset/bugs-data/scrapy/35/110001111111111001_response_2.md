The issue in the provided code seems to be related to the incorrect class path being used to instantiate `SpiderLoader` in the `_get_spider_loader` function. The input parameter `settings` is expected to have certain key-value pairs that specify the class path for `SpiderLoader` and `SpiderManager`, but the function is not using these values correctly.

Based on the test case and the error message, the problem lies in the incorrect class path being set for `SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS` in the `CrawlerRunner` initialization, which leads to the wrong type of `SpiderLoader` being instantiated.

To fix the issue:
1. Use the correct class attribute for `SpiderManager` and `SpiderLoader` classes as specified in the expected case in the `settings` dictionary. 
2. Use the correct class paths - in this case, it should be 'scrapy.spiderloader.SpiderLoader' for `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS` in the `settings` dictionary.

Here's the corrected `_get_spider_loader` function:

```python
def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS',
                            'scrapy.spiderloader.SpiderLoader')
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```

By correcting the class path in the `cls_path` variable, we ensure that the correct `SpiderLoader` class is instantiated based on the provided settings.

With this correction, the test case should now execute without any assertion errors.
