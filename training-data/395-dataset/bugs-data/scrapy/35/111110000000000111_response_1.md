The potential error in the provided function is the use of deprecated settings 'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS' and the incorrect method call `from_settings(settings.frozencopy())`. 

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug are:
1. Deprecated usage of 'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS' setting.
2. Incorrect method call `from_settings(settings.frozencopy())`.

To fix the bug, the following approaches can be considered:
1. Use the new setting 'SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS' instead of 'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'.
2. Use the correct method call to create an instance of the loader class from the settings.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import warnings
from scrapy.utils.misc import load_object
from twisted.python.components import verifyClass
from scrapy.interfaces import ISpiderLoader

def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS',
                            settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'))
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls.from_settings(settings)
```

In the corrected code:
1. We've used the 'SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS' setting instead of the deprecated 'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'.
2. Removed the `frozencopy()` method call and directly called the `from_settings()` method of the loader class to create an instance.
