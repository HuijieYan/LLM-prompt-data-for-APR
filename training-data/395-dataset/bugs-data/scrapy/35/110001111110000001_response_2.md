The test case 'test_spidermanager_deprecation' is trying to test if 'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS' is deprecated and it should use 'SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS' instead. It creates a CrawlerRunner with the 'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS' set to 'tests.test_crawler.CustomSpiderLoader' and then asserts that the 'runner.spider_loader' is an instance of 'CustomSpiderLoader'.

The bug is likely located in the '_get_spider_loader' function, specifically in the line:
```python
loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
```
This line is trying to load the spider loader class based on the value of 'SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS' or 'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS' from settings and then instantiating it, but the returned class is not the expected 'CustomSpiderLoader' class.

The reason for the bug is that the function is not using the correct class specified in the 'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS' setting. It should be using the provided class to instantiate the spider loader.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to directly instantiate the 'CustomSpiderLoader' class using the value of 'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'. Additionally, a cleanup of the deprecated 'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS' warning should be done.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected function
def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    spider_manager_class = settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS')
    if spider_manager_class:
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
        return load_object(spider_manager_class).from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
    else:
        cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS')
        loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
        verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
        return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```
In this corrected code, we first check for 'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS' and issue a warning if present. Then we directly instantiate the 'CustomSpiderLoader' class from the settings. If 'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS' is not found, we proceed with the original logic to load the spider loader class based on 'SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS'.
