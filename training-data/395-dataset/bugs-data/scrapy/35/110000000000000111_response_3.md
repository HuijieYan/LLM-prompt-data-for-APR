The potential error in the given function is that it is trying to access both 'SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS' and 'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS' from the settings, but it is not handling the deprecation warning for 'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS' properly.

The reason behind the bug is that the function is not handling the deprecation warning for 'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS' and not providing a proper replacement for it.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to handle the deprecation warning for 'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS' and use 'SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS' as the replacement. We also need to make sure that the appropriate loader class is returned based on the settings provided.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import warnings

def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=DeprecationWarning,
            stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS')
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    # Assuming load_object and verifyClass are implemented elsewhere
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```

In the corrected code:
- We handle the deprecation warning for 'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS' using `warnings.warn`.
- We directly access 'SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS' instead of using a fallback to 'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'.
- We return the appropriate loader class based on the settings provided.

This should fix the bug and handle the deprecation warning properly.
