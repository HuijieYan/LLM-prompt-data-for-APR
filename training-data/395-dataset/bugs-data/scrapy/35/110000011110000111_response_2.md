The error message is indicating that the `runner.spider_loader` is returning an instance of `scrapy.spiderloader.SpiderLoader` instead of `tests.test_crawler.CustomSpiderLoader`, which is expected.

Looking at the `_get_spider_loader` method, the bug might be in the line where the loader class is retrieved using `cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS', settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'))`. This line seems to be incorrect and should be causing the issue.

The reason for the bug is that the function is not correctly retrieving the spider loader class from the settings, leading to the wrong class being instantiated.

To fix this bug, the correct loader class should be retrieved from the settings. An appropriate check for the deprecated `SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS` should also be added.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
import warnings
from scrapy.utils.misc import load_object
from scrapy.interfaces import ISpiderLoader
from scrapy.utils.deprecate import ScrapyDeprecationWarning

def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS')
    if not cls_path:
        cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS')
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```

In this corrected function, the loader class is retrieved from the settings using `settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS')`. If it's not found, it falls back to `settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS')`. This ensures the correct loader class is used based on the settings provided.
