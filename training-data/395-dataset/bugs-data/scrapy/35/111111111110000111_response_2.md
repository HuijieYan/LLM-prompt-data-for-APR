The error message indicates that the `runner.spider_loader` is an instance of `scrapy.spiderloader.SpiderLoader` instead of `tests.test_crawler.CustomSpiderLoader`, which is expected according to the test function.

The potential error location within the `_get_spider_loader` function is the line where the `loader_cls` is obtained from the settings.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not using the correct class specified in the settings.

To fix the bug:
1. Firstly, we need to use the correct class specified in the settings for the spider loader.
2. Then, the function should be modified to utilize the correct class and return an instance of it.

The corrected function should be as follows:

```python
import warnings

def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS',
                            settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'))
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls()
```

This correction ensures that the correct class specified in the settings is used to initialize the `loader_cls` and return an instance of it.
