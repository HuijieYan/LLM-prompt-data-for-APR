Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the provided function is on the line `return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())`. The `from_settings` method is not a standard method for the class `loader_cls`.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because the method `from_settings` does not exist for the `loader_cls` class. This method is not a standard method for the `loader_cls` class and is likely a custom method that does not exist.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
We need to make sure that the `from_settings` method is a valid method for the class `loader_cls`. If it is a custom method, it needs to be defined in the class `loader_cls` or the method name should be changed to match a valid method for the class.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS',
                            settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'))
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls(settings)
```
