The error occurs in the `_robots_error` function of the `RobotsTxtMiddleware` class. It seems that the `KeyError` is raised when trying to pop the `netloc` key from the `_parsers` dictionary.

The reason behind this error is that `_parsers` dictionary doesn't contain the key `netloc` at the time when `pop` method is called. This might be due to an incorrect initialization of the `_parsers` dictionary or due to its manipulation elsewhere in the code.

To fix this issue, we can check if the `netloc` key exists in the `_parsers` dictionary before trying to pop it. We can use the `pop` method with a default value to avoid the `KeyError`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_robots_error` function:

```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    self._parsers.pop(netloc, None)
```

By providing `None` as the default value, the `pop` method will not raise a `KeyError` if the `netloc` key doesn't exist.
