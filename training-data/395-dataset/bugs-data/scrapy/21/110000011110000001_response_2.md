The error message indicates that a KeyError occurred in the `robot_parser` method of the `RobotsTxtMiddleware` class. This error occurs when trying to access a key in a dictionary that does not exist.

In the `robot_parser` method, the bug is likely to be located in the `_robots_error` method call in the `dfd.addErrback(self._robots_error, netloc)` line. This is because the `_robots_error` method is trying to access `self._parsers[netloc]` without checking if it exists.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the `_parsers` dictionary does not contain a key for the `netloc` being accessed in the `_robots_error` method. This can lead to a KeyError when trying to access a non-existent key in the dictionary.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `_robots_error` method to handle the case where the `netloc` does not exist in the `_parsers` dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the `_robots_error` method:

```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    if netloc in self._parsers:
        self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)
    else:
        # Handle the case when netloc does not exist in _parsers
        print(f"Netloc '{netloc}' not found in _parsers")
```

By checking if the `netloc` exists in the `_parsers` dictionary before attempting to access it, we can prevent the KeyError from occurring. This will ensure that the method does not try to access a non-existent key in the dictionary, thereby resolving the bug.
