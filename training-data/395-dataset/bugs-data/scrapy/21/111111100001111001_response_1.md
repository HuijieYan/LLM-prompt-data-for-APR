The buggy function `_robots_error` is intended to remove an item from the `self._parsers` dictionary. However, it is currently using the `pop` method, which returns the value of the removed item, and then immediately calling the `callback` method on that value. This is likely causing unexpected behavior and potential errors.

To fix this, we can first remove the item from the dictionary using `pop`, and then check if the removed value is not None before calling the `callback` method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    rp_dfd = self._parsers.pop(netloc, None)
    if rp_dfd is not None:
        rp_dfd.callback(None)
```
