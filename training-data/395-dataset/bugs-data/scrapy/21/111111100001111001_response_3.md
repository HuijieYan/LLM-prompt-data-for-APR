The issue with the `_robots_error` function is that it is trying to pop an item from the `self._parsers` dictionary without checking if the key exists. This can lead to a `KeyError` if the key does not exist in the dictionary.

To fix this issue, we can use the `pop()` method with a default value to avoid the `KeyError` if the key does not exist.

Here is the corrected code for the `_robots_error` function:

```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    self._parsers.pop(netloc, None)
```

With this fix, if the `netloc` key exists in the `self._parsers` dictionary, it will be removed. If it does not exist, it will not raise an error and the function will continue without any issues.
