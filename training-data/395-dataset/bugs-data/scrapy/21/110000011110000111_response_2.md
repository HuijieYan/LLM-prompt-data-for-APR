The error message "KeyError: 'site.local'" indicates that the key 'site.local' does not exist in the dictionary `self._parsers`. This is likely because the `_robots_error` method is trying to pop an item from the dictionary without confirming whether it exists.

To fix this issue, the `self._parsers` dictionary should be checked to ensure that the key `netloc` exists before attempting to pop it.

Here's the corrected code for the `_robots_error` method:

```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    if netloc in self._parsers:
        self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)
```

By adding the conditional check `if netloc in self._parsers`, we ensure that the key exists in the dictionary before attempting to pop it. This should prevent the KeyError from occurring.
