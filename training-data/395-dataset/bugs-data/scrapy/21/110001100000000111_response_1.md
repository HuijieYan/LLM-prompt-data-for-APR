Potential Bug Location:
The bug is likely occurring in the `_robots_error` function where the `pop` method is used to remove the `netloc` key from the `_parsers` dictionary.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The KeyError is occurring because the `pop` method is trying to remove a key (`netloc`) that does not exist in the `_parsers` dictionary. This could be due to a race condition or inconsistency in the handling of the `_parsers` dictionary.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the `netloc` key exists in the `_parsers` dictionary before attempting to remove it.
2. Implement error handling to handle scenarios where the `netloc` key does not exist.
3. Ensure that the `_parsers` dictionary is properly synchronized and updated to avoid race conditions.

Corrected Function:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_21/scrapy/downloadermiddlewares/robotstxt.py

# corrected function
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    if netloc in self._parsers:
        self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)
    else:
        # handle the case where netloc key does not exist
        pass
```
