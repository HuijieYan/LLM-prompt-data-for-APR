The error occurs in the `_robots_error` method of the `RobotsTxtMiddleware` class. The error message indicates a KeyError on the line `if isinstance(self._parsers[netloc], Deferred):`, which means that `self._parsers` does not contain the key `netloc`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `_robots_error` method is trying to access the `netloc` key in the `_parsers` dictionary without checking if it exists, leading to a KeyError. This likely occurs because the `pop` method was called before checking if the `netloc` key exists.

To fix the bug, you should check if the `netloc` key exists in the `_parsers` dictionary before attempting to access it. If it exists, then you can call the `pop` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `_robots_error` method:

```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    if netloc in self._parsers:
        self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)
```

This fix ensures that the `netloc` key exists in the `_parsers` dictionary before calling the `pop` method, preventing the KeyError from occurring.
