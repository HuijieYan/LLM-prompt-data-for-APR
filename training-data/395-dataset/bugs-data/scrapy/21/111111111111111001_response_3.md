The error is likely coming from the `_robots_error` function, which is trying to remove the netloc key from the `self._parsers` dictionary. The error message indicates a KeyError on the line where the function is trying to access the `self._parsers[netloc]` value. This suggests that the netloc key does not exist in the `self._parsers` dictionary at that point.

The bug occurs because the `_robots_error` function is trying to remove the netloc key from `self._parsers` without checking if it exists first. Since the `self._parsers[netloc]` value has already been popped by the time of this function, it's causing a KeyError.

One way to fix this bug is to use the `pop` method of the dictionary, which allows a default value to be returned if the key is not found. This way, the KeyError can be avoided.

Here's the corrected code for the `_robots_error` function:

```python
# Corrected _robots_error function
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    self._parsers.pop(netloc, None)
```

By using `pop(netloc, None)`, the function will remove the netloc key if it exists, or do nothing if it doesn't exist, hence avoiding the KeyError.
