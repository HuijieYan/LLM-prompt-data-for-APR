Potential error location:
The error is likely occurring at the line `self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)` in the `_robots_error` function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The error is a KeyError, which means that the key `netloc` does not exist in the dictionary `self._parsers`. This could be due to either `netloc` not being a valid key in the dictionary, or the dictionary being empty.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if `netloc` exists in the dictionary before attempting to pop it.
2. Handle the KeyError exception to prevent the program from crashing.

Corrected code:

```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    if netloc in self._parsers:
        self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)
    else:
        # handle the case where netloc is not in the dictionary
        # for example, by logging an error message
        pass
```
In this corrected code, we first check if `netloc` exists in the dictionary `self._parsers` using the `in` keyword. If it exists, we then proceed to pop the item from the dictionary. Otherwise, we can handle the case where `netloc` is not in the dictionary, such as logging an error message or taking other appropriate actions. This will prevent the KeyError from occurring.
