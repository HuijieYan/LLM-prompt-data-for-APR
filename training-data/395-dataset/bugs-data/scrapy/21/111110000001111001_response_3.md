The error in the given function `_robots_error` is that it is popping the `netloc` key from the `_parsers` dictionary without checking if the key exists. This can lead to a KeyError if the key does not exist in the dictionary.

To fix this, we need to check if the key `netloc` exists in the `_parsers` dictionary before popping it.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
# class declaration containing the fixed function
class RobotsTxtMiddleware(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the fixed function
    def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
        if netloc in self._parsers:
            self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)
```

By adding the check `if netloc in self._parsers`, we ensure that the key `netloc` exists in the dictionary before popping it. This prevents the function from throwing a KeyError and resolves the issue.
