The error message `KeyError: 'site.local'` indicates that there is a key error in the `_robots_error` method, which is caused by trying to pop a key from `self._parsers` that doesn't exist. 

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)`. 

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the `netloc` key does not exist in `self._parsers` when the `_robots_error` method is called.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_robots_error` method to handle the case where the `netloc` key does not exist in `self._parsers`.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class RobotsTxtMiddleware(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # corrected function
    def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
        parser = self._parsers.pop(netloc, None)
        if parser:
            parser.callback(None)
```

In the corrected code, we use the `pop` method with a default argument of `None`, which means that if the `netloc` key does not exist in `self._parsers`, it will not raise a `KeyError`. Instead, it will return `None`, and we can handle this case appropriately by checking if `parser` is not `None` before calling the `callback` method.
