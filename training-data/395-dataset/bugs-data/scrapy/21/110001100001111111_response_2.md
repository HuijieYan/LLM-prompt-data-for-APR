The error is occurring in the `_robots_error` function in the `robotstxt.py` file. The `KeyError` is being raised because the `netloc` key is not found in the `_parsers` dictionary. This means that the `pop` operation is removing the value associated with `netloc`, and the subsequent `callback` method call is failing because the key is no longer in the dictionary.

To fix this issue, we can update the function to first check if the `netloc` exists in the `_parsers` dictionary before attempting to remove it. If it exists, the function can then call the `callback` method on the value associated with `netloc`, and finally remove the key from the dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the `_robots_error` function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_21/scrapy/downloadermiddlewares/robotstxt.py

# corrected function
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    if netloc in self._parsers:
        rp_dfd = self._parsers.pop(netloc)
        rp_dfd.callback(None)
```

With this fix, the function first checks if the `netloc` exists in the `_parsers` dictionary before attempting any operations on it. This will prevent the `KeyError` from being raised.
