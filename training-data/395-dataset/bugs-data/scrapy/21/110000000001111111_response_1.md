The error is occurring because the _robots_error method is trying to pop a key 'netloc' from the self._parsers dictionary, but the key 'netloc' does not exist in the dictionary, leading to a KeyError.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the _robots_error method to handle the KeyError and return the expected output.

Here's the corrected code for the _robots_error method:

```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    self._parsers.pop(netloc, None)  # Use pop with default value None if key doesn't exist
```

With this modification, if the key 'netloc' does not exist in the self._parsers dictionary, the pop() method will return None and no KeyError will be raised. This will ensure that the method returns the expected output in all cases.
