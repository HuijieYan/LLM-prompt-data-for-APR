The potential error in the given function is that it is trying to pop a key from a dictionary without checking if the key exists. This can lead to a KeyError if the key does not exist in the dictionary.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the function is assuming that the 'netloc' key will always exist in the '_parsers' dictionary, which is not the case.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the 'netloc' key exists in the dictionary before popping it. If it exists, we can pop it; otherwise, we can handle it accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    if netloc in self._parsers:
        rp_dfd = self._parsers.pop(netloc)
        rp_dfd.callback(None)
```

By adding the `if netloc in self._parsers` check, we ensure that the 'netloc' key exists in the dictionary before trying to pop it. If it exists, we pop it and then call the `callback` method. If it doesn't exist, we can handle it as per the requirement of the function.
