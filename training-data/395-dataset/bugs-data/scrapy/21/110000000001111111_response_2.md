The issue here is that the _robots_error function is trying to pop a value from the self._parsers dictionary without checking if the key (netloc) exists or not. This is leading to a KeyError.

To fix this issue, we can modify the _robots_error function to check if the netloc key exists in the self._parsers dictionary before popping the value. If the key exists, we can then proceed to call the callback method on the popped value.

Here's the corrected code for the _robots_error function:

```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    if netloc in self._parsers:
        rp_dfd = self._parsers.pop(netloc)
        rp_dfd.callback(None)
```

This modification ensures that the KeyError will not occur, as we are checking for the existence of the netloc key in the self._parsers dictionary before trying to pop its value and call the callback method.
