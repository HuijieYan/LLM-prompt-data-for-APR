1. The test case is trying to test the `RobotsTxtMiddleware` by setting the `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY` setting to `True` and expecting that the `Request('http://site.local')` is not ignored by the middleware.

2. The potential error in the problematic function is the use of `self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)`. This code is trying to remove the `netloc` key from the `_parsers` dictionary and then call the `callback` method on it, which is likely causing the `KeyError` mentioned in the error message.

3. The `KeyError` occurs because the `_parsers` dictionary is being accessed with a key `netloc` that doesn't exist in the dictionary. This means that either the key is being removed somewhere else in the code before this line, or the key does not exist in the dictionary to begin with.

4. To fix the bug, the call to `pop(netloc)` should be replaced with simply accessing the value at the `netloc` key and then calling `callback(None)` on it.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    if netloc in self._parsers:
        self._parsers[netloc].callback(None)
```

By making this change, the `KeyError` mentioned in the error message should be resolved, and the function should function as intended.
