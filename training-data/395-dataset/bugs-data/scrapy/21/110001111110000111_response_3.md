The test case test_robotstxt_immediate_error is trying to create an immediate failure by simulating a DNSLookupError and then testing if the request is ignored or not. The error message indicates that there is a KeyError in the robot_parser function of the RobotsTxtMiddleware class. The KeyError occurs when the netloc is not found in the _parsers dictionary.

The bug seems to be in the robot_parser function of the RobotsTxtMiddleware class. When the netloc is not found in the _parsers dictionary, a KeyError is raised. This is likely because the netloc is not being added to the _parsers dictionary when it is first encountered.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that when a netloc is not found in the _parsers dictionary, it is added before any operations are performed on it.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def robot_parser(self, request, spider):
    url = urlparse_cached(request)
    netloc = url.netloc

    if netloc not in self._parsers:
        self._parsers[netloc] = Deferred()
        robotsurl = "%s://%s/robots.txt" % (url.scheme, url.netloc)
        robotsreq = Request(
            robotsurl,
            priority=self.DOWNLOAD_PRIORITY,
            meta={'dont_obey_robotstxt': True}
        )
        dfd = self.crawler.engine.download(robotsreq, spider)
        dfd.addCallback(self._parse_robots, netloc)
        dfd.addErrback(self._logerror, robotsreq, spider)
        dfd.addErrback(self._robots_error, netloc)

    if isinstance(self._parsers[netloc], Deferred):
        # handle the Deferred
```

In the corrected code, we check if the netloc is not in the _parsers dictionary, and if so, we add it to the dictionary and then perform further operations. This prevents the KeyError from occurring.
