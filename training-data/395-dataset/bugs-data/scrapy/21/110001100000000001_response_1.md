Potential Error:
The issue in the provided function is that it is trying to access the `callback` method of an object returned by `self._parsers.pop(netloc)`. However, since `pop` returns the value associated with the specified key, and then removes the key-value pair from the dictionary, it is likely that the `callback` method does not exist on the returned value.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because `pop` does not return the object that the `callback` method can be called on.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, instead of using `pop` which returns the popped value, we can use `popitem` which returns and removes the last key-value pair as a tuple. Also, we should check if the `netloc` key exists in the dictionary before attempting to pop it.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    parser = self._parsers.pop(netloc, None)
    if parser:
        parser.callback(None)
```
