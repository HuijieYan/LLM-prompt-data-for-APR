The error occurs in the `_robots_error` method of the `RobotsTxtMiddleware` class. The `KeyError: 'site.local'` is raised when trying to access the `self._parsers[netloc]` dictionary key, which is not present in the `_parsers` dictionary.

The reason behind the bug is that the `self._parsers[netloc]` is removed before using it in the `_robots_error` method. This causes the KeyError when this method is called.

To fix this bug, you should remove the item from the `_parsers` dictionary after you retrieve the value, not before. The corrected code for the method is as follows:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class RobotsTxtMiddleware(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
        rp_dfd = self._parsers.pop(netloc)
        rp_dfd.callback(None)
```

This fix ensures that the value associated with `netloc` is retrieved from the `_parsers` dictionary before removing it, preventing the KeyError.
