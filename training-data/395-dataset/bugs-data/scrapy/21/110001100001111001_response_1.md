The potential error in the provided function is the `self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)` line. The purpose of this line seems to be to remove the `netloc` key from the `_parsers` dictionary and then call the `callback` method on the removed value.

The error occurs because the `pop()` method removes the key from the dictionary and returns its value, but the `callback` method should be called on the removed value rather than the result of the `pop()` method.

To fix this bug, we should first store the value associated with the `netloc` key, then remove the key from the dictionary, and finally call the `callback` method on the stored value.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    parser = self._parsers.pop(netloc)  # remove the netloc key and get the value
    if parser:
        parser.callback(None)  # call callback method on the removed value if it exists
```

With this fix, the function will remove the `netloc` key from the `_parsers` dictionary and then call the `callback` method on the removed value if it exists.
