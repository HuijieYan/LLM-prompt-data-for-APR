The error occurs because the `_parsers` dictionary is being modified without checking if the key exists. To fix this, we need to ensure that the key exists in the dictionary before attempting to modify it.

One approach to fixing the bug is to use the `pop` method of the dictionary, which allows us to remove the key and return its value. If the key doesn't exist, we can provide a default value. Then, we can call the `callback` method on the returned value. This ensures that we only modify the dictionary if the key exists.

Here's the corrected code for the `robost_error` function:

```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    rp_dfd = self._parsers.pop(netloc, None)
    if rp_dfd:
        rp_dfd.callback(None)
```

With this change, we ensure that the key `netloc` is removed from the `_parsers` dictionary using `pop` and then we check if the value is not `None` before calling the `callback` method on it. This fix should prevent the `KeyError` from occurring.
