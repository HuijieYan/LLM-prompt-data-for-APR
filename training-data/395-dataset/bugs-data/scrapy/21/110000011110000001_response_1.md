1. The test case is attempting to test the behavior of the RobotsTxtMiddleware when a DNS lookup error occurs. The error message indicates a KeyError in the `robot_parser` method of the RobotsTxtMiddleware.

2. The potential error location is identified in the `_robots_error` method within the RobotsTxtMiddleware class.

3. The error is occurring because the `_robots_error` method is trying to pop a value from the `_parsers` dictionary with the key `netloc`. However, the key `netloc` is not present in the dictionary, leading to a KeyError.

4. To fix the bug, the `_robots_error` method should check if the key `netloc` exists in the `_parsers` dictionary before trying to pop it. If the key exists, then the method should proceed with popping the value.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_robots_error` method:

```python
# Corrected function
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    if netloc in self._parsers:
        self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)
```
In the corrected code, before attempting to pop the value from the dictionary, it checks if the key `netloc` exists in the dictionary. If it does, then it proceeds with popping the value and invoking the callback.
