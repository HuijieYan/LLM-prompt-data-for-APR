The error seems to be related to a KeyError in the `_robots_error` method of the `RobotsTxtMiddleware` class. This method is trying to pop a value from the `self._parsers` dictionary using the `netloc` key. However, the KeyError indicates that the `netloc` key does not exist in the `self._parsers` dictionary.

The reason for this error could be that the `netloc` key was not added to the `self._parsers` dictionary before the `_robots_error` method was called.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `_robots_error` method to check if the `netloc` key exists in the `self._parsers` dictionary before trying to pop it. If the `netloc` key exists, then we can safely pop it without triggering a KeyError.

Here's the corrected code for the `_robots_error` method:

```python
class RobotsTxtMiddleware(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
        if netloc in self._parsers:
            self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)
```

With this modified code, the `_robots_error` method will first check if the `netloc` key exists in the `self._parsers` dictionary before attempting to pop it, thereby preventing the KeyError from occurring.
