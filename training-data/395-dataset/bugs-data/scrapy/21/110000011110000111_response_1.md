1. The test case is trying to test the immediate handling of a DNSLookupError by the RobotsTxtMiddleware. The error message indicates a KeyError occurring in the robot_parser method of the RobotsTxtMiddleware.

2. The potential error location is within the robot_parser method of the RobotsTxtMiddleware.

3. The bug is occurring because the _robots_error method is trying to pop a netloc from the _parsers dictionary, which does not exist, leading to a KeyError.

4. To fix the bug, the _robots_error method should use the .remove() method on the _parsers list instead of the .pop() method. This will avoid the KeyError that is currently occurring.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected function
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    if netloc in self._parsers:
        self._parsers.remove(netloc)
    else:
        self.logger.warning("netloc %s not found in _parsers" % netloc)
```
