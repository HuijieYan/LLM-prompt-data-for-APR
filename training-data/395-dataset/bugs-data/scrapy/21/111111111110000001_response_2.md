The bug is located in the `_robots_error` method of the `RobotsTxtMiddleware` class. The error message indicates a KeyError when trying to access `self._parsers[netloc]`. This suggests that the `netloc` is not present in the `_parsers` dictionary.

The reason behind this bug is that the `_robots_error` method is trying to find `netloc` in the `_parsers` dictionary, but it is not handling the scenario where `netloc` is not present in the dictionary. This results in a KeyError.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `netloc` is present in the `_parsers` dictionary before trying to access it. If it's not present, we can handle this scenario appropriately, for example, by logging an error. Here's the corrected code for the `_robots_error` method:

```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    if netloc in self._parsers:
        self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)
    else:
        # Handle the scenario where netloc is not present in the _parsers dictionary
        print(f"Netloc '{netloc}' not found in _parsers dictionary")
```

This fix will prevent the KeyError from occurring by first checking if the `netloc` exists in the `_parsers` dictionary before trying to access it. If it doesn't exist, the method will handle this scenario appropriately.
