The error message indicates a KeyError being raised on line 65 of the RobotsTxtMiddleware class in the robot_parser method. This error occurs when trying to access a key (netloc) in the _parsers dictionary, but the key does not exist.

The _robots_error method is being called as the errback for the deferred object dfd, which means it is being called when there is an error in downloading the robots.txt file. The problematic line in the _robots_error method is:

```python
self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)
```

The issue with this line is that it assumes that netloc exists in the _parsers dictionary, which is not always the case. In the test case, the netloc being used is 'site.local', which may not have been added to the _parsers dictionary yet.

To fix this issue, we can modify the _robots_error method to first check if netloc exists in the _parsers dictionary before trying to pop it. If it exists, then we can call the callback method, otherwise, we can handle the situation accordingly.

Here's the corrected _robots_error method:

```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    if netloc in self._parsers:
        self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)
    else:
        # Handle the situation when netloc is not in _parsers
```

This modification ensures that we only pop the netloc from the _parsers dictionary if it exists, preventing the KeyError from occurring.
