The error message indicates a KeyError at line 65 of the robot_parser method in the RobotsTxtMiddleware class. This error occurs when the netloc is not found in the _parsers dictionary.

The test function test_robotstxt_immediate_error sets up a fake error using immediate_failure, which causes the failure to occur. This leads to the error being triggered in the robot_parser method.

To fix this issue, the _robots_error method should handle the KeyError by checking if the netloc exists in the _parsers dictionary before attempting to pop it.

Below is the corrected _robots_error method:

```python
class RobotsTxtMiddleware(object):
    def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
        if netloc in self._parsers:
            self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)
```

This modification ensures that the KeyError is avoided by checking if the netloc exists in the _parsers dictionary before attempting to pop it.
