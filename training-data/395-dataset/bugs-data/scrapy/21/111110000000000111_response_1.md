Potential error location:
The error is occurring in the `_robots_error` method of the `RobotsTxtMiddleware` class. It seems that `self._parsers` is a dictionary, and the error is a KeyError, which means that the `netloc` key is not present in the `_parsers` dictionary.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The error occurs because the `netloc` key is being popped from the `_parsers` dictionary without checking if it exists in the dictionary in the first place. This leads to a KeyError when trying to access a non-existent key.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, it is important to first check if the `netloc` key exists in the `_parsers` dictionary before attempting to pop it. If the key exists, then it can be safely popped without causing a KeyError.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class RobotsTxtMiddleware(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
        if netloc in self._parsers:
            self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)
        else:
            # Handle the case when netloc key does not exist in _parsers
            pass # or raise an exception, or handle in a different way based on the requirements
```
