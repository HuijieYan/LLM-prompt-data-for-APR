The buggy function `_robots_error` is causing a KeyError because it is trying to pop a key from the `self._parsers` dictionary without checking if the key exists. This results in the KeyError when the key is not found, causing the function to fail.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the function to first check if the key exists in the dictionary before attempting to pop it. If the key exists, then we can call the `callback` method on the corresponding value. Finally, we should remove the key-value pair from the dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the `_robots_error` function:

```python
class RobotsTxtMiddleware(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the fixed function
    def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
        if netloc in self._parsers:
            rp_dfd = self._parsers.pop(netloc)
            rp_dfd.callback(None)
```
