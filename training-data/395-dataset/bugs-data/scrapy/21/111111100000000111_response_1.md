Potential error location: The error occurs at the line `self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)`, where the `KeyError` is raised due to the `netloc` not being found in the `_parsers` dictionary.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `netloc` is being popped from the dictionary without verifying its existence, which leads to a `KeyError`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Before popping the `netloc` from the dictionary, it's important to check if it exists in the dictionary to avoid the `KeyError`. Additionally, handling the case when the `netloc` is not found in the dictionary should be considered.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    if netloc in self._parsers:
        self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)
    else:
        print(f"Netloc '{netloc}' not found in parsers dictionary.")
```
In the corrected code, we first check if the `netloc` exists in the `_parsers` dictionary before popping it. If it exists, we proceed with popping it and calling the `callback` function. If it doesn't exist, we print a message indicating that the `netloc` was not found in the parsers dictionary. This avoids the `KeyError` and handles the case where the `netloc` is not found.
