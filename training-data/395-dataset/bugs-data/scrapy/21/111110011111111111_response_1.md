The error occurs when trying to determine whether `netloc` is in the `self._parsers` dictionary, and if it is a Deferred. The error suggests that the key `'site.local'` does not exist in the dictionary `self._parsers`, which causes a `KeyError` when trying to access it.

To fix this bug, the function `_robots_error` should be modified to verify if `netloc` exists in `self._parsers` before trying to access it. This can be done using the `in` keyword to check if the key exists in the dictionary.

Here is the corrected code for the `RobotsTxtMiddleware` class with the fixed `_robots_error` method:

```python
class RobotsTxtMiddleware(object):

    # ... omitted code ...
    
    def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
        if netloc in self._parsers and isinstance(self._parsers[netloc], Deferred):
            self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)
```

With this modification, the function will now check if `netloc` exists in `self._parsers` before trying to access it. If it exists and is a Deferred, the callback method will be called on the corresponding Deferred object in the dictionary.
