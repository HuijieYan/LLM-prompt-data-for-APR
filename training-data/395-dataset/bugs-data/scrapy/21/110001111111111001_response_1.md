The error occurs in the `_robots_error` function of the `RobotsTxtMiddleware` class when it is called with the `netloc` parameter. 

The reason behind the bug is that the `_parsers` dictionary is used to store Deferred objects, and in the `_robots_error` function, the Deferred is being popped immediately after the callback of that Deferred is triggered. This results in the removal of the Deferred from the `_parsers` dictionary, causing a KeyError during the subsequent execution of the Deferred callback.

One approach to fixing the bug is to create a separate method to handle the removal of the Deferred from the `_parsers` dictionary after its callback is triggered. This way, the removal will not interfere with the callback operation.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    self._remove_parser(netloc)

def _remove_parser(self, netloc):
    self._parsers.pop(netloc)
```

By separating the removal of the Deferred into a new method `_remove_parser`, we ensure that the Deferred is not removed while its callback is being executed. This should eliminate the KeyError that was occurring.
