The bug in the _robots_error function is that it is popping the value corresponding to the netloc key from the self._parsers dictionary, but it is not setting the popped value to the rp_dfd variable before calling the callback method on rp_dfd. This causes the rp_dfd to still have the old value even after popping it from self._parsers.

To fix this bug, we need to set the popped value to rp_dfd before calling the callback method on it.

```python
# Corrected function
class RobotsTxtMiddleware(object):
    # ... omitted code ...


    def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
        rp_dfd = self._parsers.pop(netloc)
        rp_dfd.callback(None)
```
