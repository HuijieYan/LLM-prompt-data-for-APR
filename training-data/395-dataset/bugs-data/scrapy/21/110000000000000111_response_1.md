The error is occurring because the `pop` method is being called on the `_parsers` dictionary using the `netloc` as the key, but it does not handle the case when the key does not exist in the dictionary, which results in a `KeyError`.

To fix this bug, we can check if the `netloc` key exists in the dictionary before calling the `pop` method. If the key exists, we can remove it from the dictionary, otherwise, we can handle the case appropriately (e.g., log an error, return, etc.).

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    if netloc in self._parsers:
        self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)
    else:
        # Handle the case when netloc key does not exist in _parsers
        # For example:
        # logging.error(f"Netloc {netloc} does not exist in _parsers")
        # return None
```

With this correction, the function first checks if the `netloc` key exists in the `_parsers` dictionary before attempting to remove it using the `pop` method. If the key exists, it is removed, otherwise, an appropriate action can be taken based on the specific application requirements.
