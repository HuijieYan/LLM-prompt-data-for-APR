The error is occurring in the `_robots_error` function of the `RobotsTxtMiddleware` class. The error is a KeyError, indicating that the key `'yellowpages.co.th'` is not present in `self._parsers`.

The bug is caused because the `_robots_error` function is trying to access the `netloc` key in `self._parsers` without checking if it exists. This causes a KeyError when the key does not exist.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the `netloc` key exists in `self._parsers` before trying to access it. If it does not exist, we should handle the error appropriately, such as logging an error message or taking some other action.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    if netloc in self._parsers:
        self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)
    else:
        # Handle the error appropriately, e.g. log an error message
```

With this corrected function, we first check if the `netloc` key exists in `self._parsers`. If it does, we proceed with the `pop` and `callback` operations. If it doesn't, we can handle the error in the `else` block.
