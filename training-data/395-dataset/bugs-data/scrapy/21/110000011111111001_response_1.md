The error message indicates a KeyError in the `robot_parser` method of the `RobotsTxtMiddleware` class. The error occurs when trying to access `self._parsers[netloc]` as a key. This is consistent with the method where the `_robots_error` function is called with the `netloc` value.

The reason for the bug is that the `_robots_error` method is trying to pop an item from the `self._parsers` dictionary using the `netloc` as the key, but the item doesn't exist. This is likely due to the fact that the Deferred object associated with the `netloc` key was added through the `robot_parser` method, but this Deferred object was removed or set to None before the `_robots_error` method was called.

To fix the bug, the `_robots_error` method should handle the case where the `netloc` key does not exist in the dictionary. Instead of trying to pop the item using `netloc` as the key, it can simply remove the key from the dictionary if it exists.

Here's the corrected version of the `_robots_error` method:

```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    if netloc in self._parsers:
        del self._parsers[netloc]
```

This modification will prevent the KeyError and handle the case where the `netloc` key does not exist in the dictionary.
