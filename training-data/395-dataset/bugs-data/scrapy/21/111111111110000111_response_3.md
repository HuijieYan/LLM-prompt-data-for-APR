The key error is occurring in the `robot_parser` method of the `RobotsTxtMiddleware` class. The error is happening because the `netloc` is not present in the `_parsers` dictionary when trying to access it using `self._parsers[netloc]`.

The potential reason for this bug is that the `_parse_robots` method is not populating the `_parsers` dictionary properly, leading to the `netloc` not being present in the dictionary when it is accessed in the `robot_parser` method.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `netloc` is properly populated in the `_parsers` dictionary in the `_parse_robots` method. We also need to handle the case where `netloc` is not present in the `_parsers` dictionary in the `robot_parser` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `RobotsTxtMiddleware` class:

```python
class RobotsTxtMiddleware(object):
    def __init__(self, crawler):
        self._parsers = {}  # initialize _parsers dictionary

    def _parse_robots(self, response, netloc):
        self._parsers[netloc] = response
        self._parsers[netloc].callback(response)

    def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
        if netloc in self._parsers:
            self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)
```

In the corrected code:
- We initialize the `_parsers` dictionary in the `__init__` method.
- In the `_parse_robots` method, we populate the `_parsers` dictionary with the `netloc` as the key and the response as the value.
- In the `_robots_error` method, we check if the `netloc` is present in the `_parsers` dictionary before trying to pop it.

These changes should fix the KeyError in the robotstxt middleware.
