Potential error location: The error seems to occur when trying to access the `netloc` key from the `_parsers` dictionary.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The error is a KeyError, indicating that the `netloc` key does not exist in the `_parsers` dictionary when trying to access it.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We need to handle the KeyError by checking if the `netloc` key exists in the dictionary before trying to access it.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    if netloc in self._parsers:
        self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)
    else:
        # handle the case when netloc is not in _parsers
        # for example, raise an exception or provide a default behavior
        pass
```
