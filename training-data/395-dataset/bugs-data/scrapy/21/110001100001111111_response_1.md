The error is occurring due to a KeyError in the `_robots_error` function. It seems that the function is trying to pop an item from the `_parsers` dictionary using the `netloc` key, but the `netloc` key is not present in the dictionary, resulting in a KeyError.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_robots_error` function to handle the KeyError gracefully by using the `pop` method with a default value. This way, if the key is not present in the dictionary, the function will not raise a KeyError.

Here's the corrected code for the `_robots_error` function:

```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    self._parsers.pop(netloc, None)
```

By using `self._parsers.pop(netloc, None)`, we ensure that if the `netloc` key is present in the dictionary, its value will be popped and returned. If the `netloc` key is not present in the dictionary, the function will return None, and no KeyError will be raised.

This fix should resolve the KeyError issue in the robotstxt middleware.
