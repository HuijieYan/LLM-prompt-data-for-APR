The error occurs in the `_robots_error` method of the `RobotsTxtMiddleware` class. The error is a KeyError, indicating that the key `'site.local'` is not found in the `_parsers` dictionary.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)` line of code removes the key from the `_parsers` dictionary, causing a KeyError when trying to access it later.

To fix this bug, we can remove the `pop` operation and replace it with a simple assignment to `None`.

Here is the corrected code for the `_robots_error` method:

```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    self._parsers[netloc] = None
```

By making this change, we ensure that the `_parsers` dictionary still contains the `netloc` key with a value of `None`, preventing the KeyError from occurring in the subsequent code.
