1. The error message indicates a KeyError occurring in the `robot_parser` method of the `RobotsTxtMiddleware` class.

2. The potential error location is the line `self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)` in the `_robots_error` method. This line attempts to pop an item from the `_parsers` dictionary using the `netloc` as the key, which can lead to a KeyError if the key doesn't exist in the dictionary.

3. The error occurs because the `netloc` key is not present in the `_parsers` dictionary when it is being accessed in the `_robots_error` method.

4. To fix the bug, the `_robots_error` method should first check if the `netloc` key exists in the `_parsers` dictionary before attempting to pop it.

5. Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    if netloc in self._parsers:
        self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)
    else:
        # Handle the case where netloc is not in _parsers
        pass  # You can add your handling logic here
```
