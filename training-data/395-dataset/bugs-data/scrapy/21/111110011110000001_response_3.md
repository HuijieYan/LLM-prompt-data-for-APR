1. The test case is trying to simulate an immediate error by setting the download.side_effect to a DNSLookupError. The error message indicates a KeyError occurring in the robot_parser function of the RobotsTxtMiddleware class.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the _robots_error method, specifically the line self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None), where it tries to pop an item from the _parsers dictionary using the netloc key.

3. The bug occurs because the _robots_error method is trying to pop an item from the _parsers dictionary using the netloc key without checking if the key exists in the dictionary. This leads to a KeyError when trying to access a non-existent key.

4. To fix the bug, the _robots_error method should first check if the netloc key exists in the _parsers dictionary before trying to pop it. If the key exists, then it should proceed with popping the item and invoking the callback.

5. Here's the corrected code for the _robots_error method:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class RobotsTxtMiddleware(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # the corrected function
    def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
        if netloc in self._parsers:
            self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)
```

By adding the check if netloc in self._parsers, we can prevent the KeyError from occurring when trying to access a non-existent key in the dictionary.
