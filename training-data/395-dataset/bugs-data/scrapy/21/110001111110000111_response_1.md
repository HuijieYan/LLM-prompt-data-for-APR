1. The test case sets the ROBOTSTXT_OBEY setting to True, sets up a DNSLookupError, and then tries to assert that a request to 'http://site.local' is not ignored by the RobotsTxtMiddleware.

2. The error message occurs in the robot_parser method of the RobotsTxtMiddleware class, specifically at the line `if isinstance(self._parsers[netloc], Deferred):`, where the KeyError 'site.local' is raised.

3. The KeyError is raised because the netloc 'site.local' is not found in the _parsers dictionary, which is supposed to hold Deferred objects for different netlocs where robots.txt files are being parsed. This likely happens because the _parsers dictionary does not get populated correctly in the middleware.

4. There are a few possible approaches to fixing the bug:
   a. Ensure that the _parsers dictionary gets populated correctly with netloc keys and corresponding Deferred objects.
   b. Handle the case where the netloc key is not found in the _parsers dictionary gracefully to avoid the KeyError.

5. Fix the buggy function as below:

```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    if netloc in self._parsers:
        self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)
```

This fix adds a check to ensure that the netloc exists in the _parsers dictionary before trying to pop and callback. If the netloc is not in the dictionary, the function will not perform any actions, avoiding the KeyError.
