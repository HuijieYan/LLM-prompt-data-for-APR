The error message indicates a KeyError at line 65 in the file robotstxt.py. This suggests that the code is trying to access a key in a dictionary that does not exist, which is consistent with the provided bug description.

The buggy function _robots_error is being called when a Deferred is encountered in the _parse_robots function. It removes the "netloc" key from the self._parsers dictionary, resulting in the KeyError observed in the test function.

To fix this bug, a conditional check can be added to verify if the "netloc" key exists in the dictionary before attempting to remove it. This will prevent the KeyError from occurring.

Here's the corrected code for the _robots_error function:

```python
class RobotsTxtMiddleware(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
        if netloc in self._parsers:
            self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)
```

With this modification, the _robots_error function will only attempt to remove the "netloc" key if it exists in the dictionary, preventing the KeyError from happening.
