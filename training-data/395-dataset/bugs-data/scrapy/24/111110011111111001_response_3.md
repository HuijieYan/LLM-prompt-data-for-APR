The error message shows that a `TypeError` occurred, indicating that the data must not be unicode. This suggests that there might be an issue with data types in the `requestTunnel` function.

Upon analyzing the `requestTunnel` function, the potential error location is identified in the line: `protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)`. It's possible that `tunnelReq` needs to be encoded to bytes before writing it to the transport.

The bug occurred because the `tunnelReq` variable is of type `bytes`, but the `protocol.transport.write()` method expects a string or bytes, and it seems to be getting a string. To fix this bug, the `tunnelReq` should be explicitly encoded into bytes before writing it to the transport.

Below is the corrected code for the `requestTunnel` function:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost.decode(), self._tunneledPort)  # Encode to bytes
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq.encode())  # Encode to bytes
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```

In the corrected code:
1. The `self._tunneledHost` is decoded to convert it from bytes to a string before forming `tunnelReq`.
2. The `tunnelReq` is then encoded into bytes before writing it to the transport using `protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq.encode())`.

This should resolve the `TypeError` issue and ensure that the `tunnelReq` is of the correct type before writing it to the transport.
