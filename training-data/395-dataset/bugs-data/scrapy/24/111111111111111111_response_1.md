The problem is occurring in the `requestTunnel` method of the `TunnelingTCP4ClientEndpoint` class. The error message suggests a TypeError related to unicode data. It seems that the `tunnelReq` variable is being encoded to bytes, so the issue might be with the encoding process where it is treating the input as Unicode.

To fix this bug, we can explicitly encode the `tunnelReq` variable as bytes using the appropriate encoding method.

Here's the corrected code for the `requestTunnel` method:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost.decode(), self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq.encode())
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```

In this corrected code:
- The `tunnelReq` is explicitly decoded using the `decode()` method to convert it from bytes to string (assuming the input is in the correct encoding).
- The `tunnelReq` is then explicitly encoded using the `encode()` method to convert it from string to bytes before writing to the transport.

These changes should ensure that the data being sent is properly encoded as bytes, thus resolving the TypeError related to unicode data.
