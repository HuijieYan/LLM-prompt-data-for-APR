The error message indicates a TypeError related to data being passed in Unicode format, leading to a failure in the `test_download_with_proxy_https_timeout` function. This type error typically occurs when trying to write non-ASCII data to a transport. 

Upon reviewing the provided code, the potential error location is within the `requestTunnel` function, specifically in the line `protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)`. It is likely that the `tunnelReq` variable is in Unicode format, which could be causing the TypeError.

The bug occurs because the `tunnelReq` is not encoded properly, and when trying to write it to the transport, it is causing a type error due to Unicode encoding.

One approach to fixing this bug would be to properly encode the `tunnelReq` string into a byte format before writing it to the protocol's transport. This can be achieved using the `encode` method on the string.

Here's the corrected code for the `requestTunnel` function:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost, self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    tunnelReq = tunnelReq.encode('utf-8')  # Encode the string to byte format
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```

By including the `tunnelReq.encode('utf-8')` line, we ensure that the `tunnelReq` string is properly encoded to byte format before writing it to the transport, thus preventing the type error that caused the failure in the test case.
