The potential error in the provided function is likely due to the use of `protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)`. This line assumes that the `protocol` object has a `transport` attribute, which may not always be the case.

The error occurs because the `protocol` object does not have a `transport` attribute or the correct type of object associated with it. This can happen if the `protocol` is not of the expected type, or if it has not been initialized properly.

To fix this bug, you should first check whether the `protocol` object has a `transport` attribute before attempting to access it. If it does not, or if it is not of the expected type, you can handle this error gracefully by raising an exception or returning an appropriate value.

Here's the corrected code for the `requestTunnel` function:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost, self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    
    if hasattr(protocol, 'transport') and hasattr(protocol.transport, 'write'):
        protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)
    else:
        raise AttributeError("Protocol object does not have a transport attribute or the correct type.")
    
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
``` 

In the corrected code, we first check if the `protocol` object has a `transport` attribute and if that `transport` object has a `write` method. If these conditions are not met, we raise an `AttributeError` to handle the case where the `protocol` object is not as expected.
