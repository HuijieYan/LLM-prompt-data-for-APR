After analyzing the test case, it appears that the test is expecting a TimeoutError but encountering a TypeError. This implies that the proxy request is not handling the request timeout correctly.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the `protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)` line. It seems that the issue might be related to handling the data types correctly when writing to the protocol's transport.

The error message indicates that a TypeError is occurring because "Data must not be unicode." This suggests that the data being written to the protocol's transport is not in the expected format.

To fix the bug, the `tunnelReq` variable should be encoded to bytes before writing to the protocol's transport. This will ensure that the data being written is in the correct format.

Here's the corrected code for the `requestTunnel` function:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost, self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    tunnelReq = tunnelReq.encode('utf-8')  # Encode tunnelReq to bytes
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```

By encoding `tunnelReq` using `encode('utf-8')`, we ensure that the data being written to the protocol's transport is in the correct format, addressing the TypeError issue.
