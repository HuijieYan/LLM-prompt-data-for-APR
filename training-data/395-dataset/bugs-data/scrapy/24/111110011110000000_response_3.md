    An endpoint that tunnels through proxies to allow HTTPS downloads. To

    The HTTP CONNECT is always sent when using this endpoint, I think this could
    be improved as the CONNECT will be redundant if the connection associated
    with this endpoint comes from the pool and a CONNECT has already been issued
    for it.
