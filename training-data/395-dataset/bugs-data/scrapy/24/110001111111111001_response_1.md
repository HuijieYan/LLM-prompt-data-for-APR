The error indicates that the variable `tunnelReq` and `self._protocol` are not being set correctly before the function returns. This is likely causing the incorrect protocol data to be sent, leading to a TypeError.

Potential error location: 
It's possible that the `tunnelReq` is not being correctly encoded and the `self._protocol` is not being set before the function returns.

Reasons behind the bug: 
The `tunnelReq` is not being consistently assigned and the `self._protocol` is not being properly stored.

Possible approaches:
1. Encode `tunnelReq` appropriately.
2. Set `self._protocol` before returning.

```python
# corrected function
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
        """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
        tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost.decode('utf-8'), self._tunneledPort)
        if isinstance(self._proxyAuthHeader, bytes):
            tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader.decode('utf-8')
        tunnelReq += '\r\n'
        protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq.encode('utf-8'))
        self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
        protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
        self._protocol = protocol
        return protocol
```
