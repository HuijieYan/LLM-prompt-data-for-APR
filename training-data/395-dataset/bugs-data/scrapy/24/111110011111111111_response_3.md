The error message indicates that the problematic function `requestTunnel` from the class `TunnelingTCP4ClientEndpoint` is causing a `TypeError` by writing unicode data instead of bytes. This leads to a failure in the protocol processing and subsequently to a TimeoutError in the test case.

The root cause of the bug is that the `tunnelReq` variable within the `requestTunnel` method is being treated as bytes, yet it is actually resulting in unicode data. This is happening due to the concatenation of the `tunnelReq` string with other strings without encoding. 

To fix this bug:
1. The `tunnelReq` variable should be properly encoded to bytes before being written to the transport.
2. The concatenation process should be modified to ensure that all the parts of the string are in bytes format.
3. Additionally, the `protocol` should be checked for existence before calling `transport.write(tunnelReq)` to avoid potential errors if `protocol` is not set.

Below is the corrected code for the `requestTunnel` method:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost.decode(),  # Decode to convert it to unicode string
                                              str(self._tunneledPort))  # Convert to string
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += b'Proxy-Authorization: ' + self._proxyAuthHeader + b'\r\n'  # Ensure that the prefix 'b' is added to indicate bytes
    tunnelReq += b'\r\n'  # Ensure that the prefix 'b' is added to indicate bytes
    if protocol.transport:  # Check for the existence of protocol
        protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq.encode('utf-8'))  # Encode the message into bytes before writing to the transport
        self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
        protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
        self._protocol = protocol
        return protocol
    else:
        # Handle the case if protocol.transport is not available
        return None
```

The corrected code addresses the bug by ensuring that the `tunnelReq` string is properly encoded to bytes where necessary and that the protocol transport is existent before writing the tunnel request.
