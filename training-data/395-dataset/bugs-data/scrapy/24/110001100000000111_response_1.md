Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the assignment of the `dataReceived` function to `self.processProxyResponse`, as it should be assigned to the `processProxyResponse` function without `self`.

Reason for the bug: The error occurs because the `processProxyResponse` function is being accessed as an instance method (with `self`), but it is defined as a class method.

Approach for fixing the bug: Remove `self` from the assignment of the `dataReceived` function to `processProxyResponse` so that it is assigned correctly.

Corrected code:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost,
                                              self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```
