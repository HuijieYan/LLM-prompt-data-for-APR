Potential error location: 
The potential error in the `requestTunnel` function lies in the reassignment of the `protocol.dataReceived` method to `self.processProxyResponse` without properly saving the original `dataReceived` method.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The buggy code does not save the original `dataReceived` method before reassigning it to `self.processProxyResponse`. This means that the original `dataReceived` method is lost and cannot be restored.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to save the original `dataReceived` method before reassigning it and ensure that it can be restored when needed. This can be achieved by saving the original `dataReceived` method in a temporary variable before the reassignment.

Corrected code:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost, self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    
    # Save the original dataReceived method
    self._originalDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    # Reassign the dataReceived method to processProxyResponse
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol

# Add a method to restore the original dataReceived method
def restoreDataReceived(self):
    self._protocol.dataReceived = self._originalDataReceived
```

This code saves the original `dataReceived` method in `self._originalDataReceived` and provides a method `restoreDataReceived` to restore the original method if needed.
