# Potential Error Location
The potential error in the `requestTunnel` function is at the line `protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)`. This is where the code attempts to write the tunnel request to the transport of the protocol.

# Reasons Behind the Bug
The error occurs because the `protocol.transport` object does not have a `write` method or the `write` method is not being used correctly. This could be due to the incorrect use of the `protocol.transport` object or a different type of object being assigned to it.

# Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug
1. Check if the `protocol.transport` object is the correct type and has the `write` method available. 
2. If the `protocol.transport` object is not correct, find the correct object from which to send the `tunnelReq`.
3. Handle any exceptions or errors that may occur when writing to the transport.

# Corrected Code
```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost, self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    
    # Check if the transport object is the correct type and has the write method
    if hasattr(protocol, 'transport') and hasattr(protocol.transport, 'write'):
        protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)
        
        # Store the original dataReceived method and assign the processProxyResponse method
        self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
        protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
        self._protocol = protocol
        return protocol
    else:
        # Handle the case where the transport object is not correct
        print("Error: Protocol transport object is not valid")
```
In the corrected code, we first check if the `protocol.transport` object is the correct type and has the `write` method. If it does, we use it to write the tunnel request. We also store the original `dataReceived` method and assign the `processProxyResponse` method. If the `protocol.transport` object is not valid, we handle this case and print an error message.
