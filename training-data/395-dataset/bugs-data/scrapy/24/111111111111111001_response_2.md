The error message suggests that the issue occurs when the function `requestTunnel` of the class `TunnelingTCP4ClientEndpoint` is being executed. It seems that the HTTP CONNECT request generated in the `requestTunnel` function results in a `TypeError` related to data that must not be unicode.

The bug occurs because the `tunnelReq` in the `requestTunnel` function is expected to be of type `bytes` but it might be inferred as `unicode` due to incorrect handling of string concatenation.

To fix this bug, the `tunnelReq` should explicitly be encoded as `bytes` before any concatenation takes place. This can be done using `str.encode('ascii')` method. Additionally, the incorrect usage of `protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)` should be replaced with `protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq.encode('ascii'))` to ensure that `bytes` are being sent.

Here's the corrected code for the `requestTunnel` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = b'CONNECT ' + self._tunneledHost + b':' + str(self._tunneledPort).encode('ascii') + b' HTTP/1.1\r\n'
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += b'Proxy-Authorization: ' + self._proxyAuthHeader + b'\r\n'
    tunnelReq += b'\r\n'
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```
