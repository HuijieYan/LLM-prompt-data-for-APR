The error occurs in the `requestTunnel` function, specifically at the line `protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)`, where it seems like the `tunnelReq` variable (which contains the HTTP CONNECT request) is not being encoded properly before being sent over the network.

This error is likely occurring because `tunnelReq` is a Unicode string, but the Twisted networking library expects it to be a byte string.

To fix this issue, we need to convert the `tunnelReq` Unicode string to a byte string before writing it to the transport.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost, self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    encoded_tunnelReq = tunnelReq.encode('utf-8')  # Convert Unicode string to byte string
    protocol.transport.write(encoded_tunnelReq)
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```
