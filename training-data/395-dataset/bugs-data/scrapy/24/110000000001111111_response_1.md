The potential error in the provided function is that it is not properly forming the `tunnelReq` string before writing it to the protocol's transport. This could lead to unexpected behavior when trying to establish a tunnel through the proxy.

The reason for the bug could be that the function is not properly constructing the `tunnelReq` string, which might lead to incorrect formatting or missing information in the request sent to the proxy server.

To fix the bug, we need to properly construct the `tunnelReq` string and return the `protocol` object at the end of the function. Additionally, we should handle any exceptions that might occur while writing to the transport.

Here's the corrected code for the `requestTunnel` function:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost.decode('utf-8'), self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    
    try:
        protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq.encode('utf-8'))
        self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
        protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
        self._protocol = protocol
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Error writing to protocol transport: {e}")
    
    return protocol
```

In this corrected code:
1. The `tunnelReq` string is properly formatted and encoded as needed before being written to the protocol's transport.
2. We added a try-except block to handle any exceptions that might occur while writing to the transport.
3. We return the `protocol` object at the end of the function, as was the case in the original code.
