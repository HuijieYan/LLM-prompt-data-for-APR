The test case is a part of the Scrapy framework and it is testing the functionality of downloading a resource through a proxy server with a timeout. The error message indicates that a TypeError is being raised, specifically stating that "Data must not be unicode".

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `requestTunnel` function. It seems that the issue is related to the data type being sent when the `write` method is called on `protocol.transport`. The error message suggests that the data being written is of type unicode when it should not be.

The bug occurs because the code is not handling the encoding of the data properly before writing it to the transport. As a result, unicode data is being sent to the transport, causing the TypeError.

To fix the bug, we can encode the `tunnelReq` string to bytes before writing it to the transport.

Here's the corrected code for the `requestTunnel` function:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost, self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    encoded_tunnelReq = tunnelReq.encode('utf-8')  # Encode the string to bytes
    protocol.transport.write(encoded_tunnelReq)
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```
