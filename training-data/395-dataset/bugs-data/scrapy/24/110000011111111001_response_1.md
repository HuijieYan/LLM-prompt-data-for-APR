The error message indicates that there is an issue with the data type being used in the function `requestTunnel`. Based on the error message, it seems that the problem is related to the data type being passed to the `transport.write` operation in the `requestTunnel` function.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `tunnelReq` data is of type `bytes`, but the `transport.write` operation expects the data to be of type `str`.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the `tunnelReq` data is converted to a string before passing it to the `transport.write` operation.

Below is the corrected version of the `requestTunnel` function with the necessary changes:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost.decode('utf-8'),
                                              self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader.decode('utf-8')
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq.encode('utf-8'))
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```

In the corrected version, the `tunnelReq` bytes are decoded to strings using the `decode` method. Also, the resulting strings are encoded back to bytes using the `encode` method before being passed to the `transport.write` operation. This ensures that the data type is compatible with the `transport.write` operation.
