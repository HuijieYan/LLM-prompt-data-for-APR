The error message indicates a `TypeError` related to data being unicode. This is likely due to the `requestTunnel` function, possibly with the `protocol.transport.write` line, causing the issue. This function seems related to handling the tunneling through proxies for HTTPS downloads.

The bug in the code could be due to the incorrect encoding of the `tunnelReq` string before writing it to the `protocol.transport`. The function may need to explicitly encode the string before writing it to the transport.

To fix the bug, the `tunnelReq` string should be encoded to bytes before writing it to the transport. This can be done using the `encode` method on the string.

Here's the corrected code for the `requestTunnel` function:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost, self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'

    # encode tunnelReq to bytes
    tunnelReq_bytes = tunnelReq.encode("utf-8")

    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq_bytes)
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```
