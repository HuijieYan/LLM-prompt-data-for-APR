The error message indicates a failure during the execution of the `test_download_with_proxy_https_timeout` test case due to a TypeError with the message "Data must not be unicode". The traceback shows that the issue is within the `requestTunnel` function of the `http11.py` module. Specifically, the error is raised at line 100 of `http11.py`.

The bug is likely occurring due to incorrect concatenation of byte strings with regular strings, leading to the creation of a unicode string. In Python 3, mixing byte strings and regular strings can lead to Unicode-related errors, such as the one observed here.

To fix the bug, the following changes can be made:
1. Encode the regular string part to bytes before concatenating it with the byte string, ensuring the resulting string is entirely in bytes.
2. Since the input values provided for the variables are correct, no changes are needed in that regard.

Here's the corrected code for the `requestTunnel` method:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = b'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost, self._tunneledPort).encode()
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += b'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader.encode()
    tunnelReq += b'\r\n'
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```
