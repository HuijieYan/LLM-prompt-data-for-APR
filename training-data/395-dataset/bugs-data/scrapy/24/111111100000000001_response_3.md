The potential error in the `requestTunnel` function is that it seems to be trying to assign `protocol.dataReceived` to `self.processProxyResponse` without binding the method to the instance of the class. This means that the method will not have access to the instance attributes and will result in an error.

To fix this, we can use the `functools.partial` method to bind the instance to the method before assigning it to `protocol.dataReceived`.

Here's the corrected code for the `requestTunnel` function:

```python
import functools

# ... (other code) ...

def processProxyResponse(self, bytes):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost, self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = functools.partial(self.processProxyResponse, self)  # Bind the instance to the method
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```

In this corrected code, the `functools.partial` method is used to bind the instance `self` to the `self.processProxyResponse` method before assigning it to `protocol.dataReceived`. This ensures that the method has access to the instance attributes and resolves the issue of the buggy method.
