Potential error location within the problematic function:
The error is likely occurring because the `tunnelReq` is being decoded as Unicode when constructing the HTTP tunnel request, which might be causing a mismatch in encoding. This could lead to a `UnicodeError` when trying to write to the transport.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `tunnelReq` is created as a string using the % operator, which might result in it being converted to Unicode. When writing this string to the transport, it might cause a `UnicodeError` if the transport expects bytes.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Encode the `tunnelReq` string to bytes before writing it to the transport.
2. Ensure that the encoding used in constructing the `tunnelReq` matches the encoding expected by the transport.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = b'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost,
                                                  self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += b'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader.encode('utf-8')  # Assuming _proxyAuthHeader is a string
    tunnelReq += b'\r\n'
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```
In this corrected implementation:
- `tunnelReq` is encoded with `b` prefix to ensure it is represented as bytes.
- If `_proxyAuthHeader` is a string, it is being encoded as well to ensure compatibility with the request and transport encoding.
