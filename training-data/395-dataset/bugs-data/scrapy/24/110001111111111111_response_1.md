The error message indicates that the data being written to the protocol's transport is of type unicode, which is not allowed. This corresponds to the function `requestTunnel` in the provided code, where `tunnelReq` is of type `bytes` and there is no explicit handling to ensure it remains as `bytes`.

To fix this issue, the `tunnelReq` variable should be encoded to `bytes` explicitly to ensure it remains as `bytes`. This can be achieved by using `encode()` function on the string.

Here's the corrected code for the `requestTunnel` function:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost.decode('utf-8'),
                                              str(self._tunneledPort))
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq.encode())  # Encode to bytes before writing
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```
