The error message indicates a `TypeError` with the message "Data must not be unicode." This suggests that there is an issue with the data type being handled in the `requestTunnel` function of the `TunnelingTCP4ClientEndpoint` class. This function is responsible for establishing a tunnel through proxies to allow HTTPS downloads.

The potential error location within the `requestTunnel` function is the line:
```python
protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that `tunnelReq` is of type `bytes`, but the `write` method expects a `str` (unicode).

To fix the bug, it is necessary to convert `tunnelReq` from `bytes` to `str` before writing it to the transport.

Here's the corrected code for the `requestTunnel` function:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost.decode(), self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader.decode()
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq.encode())
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```

In this corrected code:
- `self._tunneledHost` and `self._proxyAuthHeader` are decoded to `str` using the `.decode()` method to convert them from `bytes` to `str`.
- `tunnelReq` is encoded to `bytes` before writing it to the transport using the `.encode()` method.
