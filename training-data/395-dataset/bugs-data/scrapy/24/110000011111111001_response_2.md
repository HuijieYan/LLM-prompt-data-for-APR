The error message indicates that the data must not be Unicode. This suggests that the data being written to the transport is in Unicode format instead of the expected bytes format.

The potential error location is identified in the line: `protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)` where `tunnelReq` is a Unicode type string.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `tunnelReq` is being created as a Unicode type string using the `%s` format specifier, which is incorrect. It should be in bytes format.

To fix the bug, the `tunnelReq` should be encoded to bytes format before writing it to the transport.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost.decode('utf-8'),
                                              self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq.encode('utf-8'))
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```
