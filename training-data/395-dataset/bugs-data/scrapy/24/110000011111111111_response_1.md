The error occurs when trying to make a connection to a non-existing domain using a proxy. The error message indicates that the data must not be Unicode, which indicates that there may be an issue with the conversion of data types.

The potential error location within the `requestTunnel` function is with the `tunnelReq` variable, which is being formatted using `%s` for string substitution. This suggests that the data type for `self._tunneledHost` and `self._tunneledPort` might be incorrect.

The reason behind the bug is the incorrect data type being used for string substitution, leading to a Unicode-related error.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to handle the data types correctly and ensure that the `tunnelReq` string is formatted with the correct data types.

Here's the corrected code for the `requestTunnel` function:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%d HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost.decode('utf-8'),
                                               self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader.decode('utf-8')
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```

In the corrected code:
1. The `tunnelReq` string is formatted using `%s` for the domain and `%d` for port to ensure that the correct data types are used.
2. If `self._tunneledHost` and `self._proxyAuthHeader` are of type `bytes` (as specified in the input), they are decoded to UTF-8 strings before being used in the string formatting.
3. The data type of `self._tunneledPort` is correctly maintained as an integer for string substitution.
4. The formatted `tunnelReq` is sent via the `protocol.transport.write` method to establish the tunnel.

This should fix the bug related to Unicode data type errors and ensure that the `requestTunnel` function works correctly with the correct data types.
