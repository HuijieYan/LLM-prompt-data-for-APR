The error message indicates that a `TypeError` is being raised with the message "Data must not be unicode" at the line `protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)` in the `requestTunnel` method. This implies that the code is attempting to write unicode data to the transport, which is causing the `TypeError`.

The reason behind this bug is that the `tunnelReq` string is not encoded in bytes before being written to the transport, and the transport expects bytes.

To fix this bug, the `tunnelReq` string should be encoded to bytes before being written to the transport.

Here's the corrected code for the `requestTunnel` method:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = ('CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost, self._tunneledPort)).encode('utf-8')
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += ('Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader).encode('utf-8')
    tunnelReq += b'\r\n'
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```

In the corrected code, the `tunnelReq` string is encoded using the UTF-8 encoding before being written to the transport. This ensures that the data being written to the transport is in the correct format (bytes) and should resolve the `TypeError` issue.
