The error message indicates that the data being written should not be unicode, which could be related to the `tunnelReq` string being unicode in the `requestTunnel` function of the `TunnelingTCP4ClientEndpoint` class.

The bug occurs because the `tunnelReq` string should not be unicode, but it is being concatenated with unicode strings using the `+=` operator. This results in a unicode string, causing the error when it is being written to the transport's protocol.

To fix the bug, the `tunnelReq` string should be encoded to bytes using the appropriate encoding before being written to the transport's protocol.

Here's the corrected code for the `requestTunnel` function:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = ('CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost, self._tunneledPort)).encode('utf-8')
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        authHeader = 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
        tunnelReq += authHeader.encode('utf-8')
    tunnelReq += b'\r\n'
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```

In this corrected function, the `tunnelReq` string is encoded to bytes using the UTF-8 encoding before being written to the transport's protocol, which should resolve the unicode-related error.
