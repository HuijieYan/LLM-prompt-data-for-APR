The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to data being in unicode when it should not be. The function `requestTunnel` seems to be the potential error location because it involves creating a tunnel request and sending it as bytes, which might be causing the Unicode error.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be that the `tunnelReq` needs to be encoded to bytes before sending it over the network.

To fix this bug, the `tunnelReq` should be encoded to bytes using the appropriate encoding (e.g., UTF-8) before writing it to the protocol's transport.

Here's the corrected code for the `requestTunnel` function:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost.decode('utf-8'),
                                                self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader.decode('utf-8')
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq.encode('utf-8'))
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```

In this corrected code, the `tunnelReq` is first converted to a Unicode string using `.decode(utf-8)` and then encoded to bytes using `.encode(utf-8)` before writing it to the protocol's transport. This should resolve the `TypeError` caused by Unicode data.
