The error is triggered while the `requestTunnel` function is being executed. The `TypeError` occurs while trying to write the `tunnelReq` to the protocol's transport. The `tunnelReq` is a unicode string, but the transport's write method expects bytes.

The bug occurred because the `tunnelReq` was not encoded to bytes before being written to the transport. This caused a `TypeError` as non-ASCII characters can't be written directly to the transport.

To fix the bug, the `tunnelReq` should be encoded to bytes before being written to the transport.

Here's the corrected code for the `requestTunnel` function:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost, self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    
    # Encoding the string to bytes
    tunnelReq = tunnelReq.encode('utf-8')

    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```
