This bug seems to be occurring in the `requestTunnel` method of the `TunnelingTCP4ClientEndpoint` class. The error message indicates a `TypeError` due to data being unicode when it shouldn't be.

The reason behind this bug could be that the `tunnelReq` variable is not encoded properly, resulting in unicode data being sent. This could be due to the difference in Python 2 and Python 3 regarding unicode handling.

To fix this bug, we need to encode the `tunnelReq` before writing it to the protocol's transport.

Here's the corrected code for the `requestTunnel` function:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost, self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    tunnelReq = tunnelReq.encode('utf-8')  # encode the request
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
``` 

Adding the `encode('utf-8')` statement ensures that the `tunnelReq` is encoded as bytes before being written to the protocol's transport. This should resolve the `TypeError` issue caused by the Unicode data.
