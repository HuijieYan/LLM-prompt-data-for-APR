Potential error location: The error may be in the line `protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)` as it is trying to access the `transport` attribute of the `protocol` object.

Reason for the bug: The `protocol` object does not have a `transport` attribute. It seems like the intention was to send the `tunnelReq` over the network, but the incorrect method is being used to achieve this.

Approach for fixing the bug: Instead of trying to access the `transport` attribute of the `protocol` object, use the appropriate method to send the `tunnelReq` over the network.

Corrected code:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost,
                                              self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    
    # Send tunnelReq over the network using the appropriate method (e.g., write, send, etc.)
    self.transport.write(tunnelReq)  # Assuming that the current instance has a 'transport' attribute
    
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```
