The potential error location within the `requestTunnel` function is the line: `protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)`. This line is trying to access the `transport` attribute directly, which may not always be available. Additionally, the function does not handle potential exceptions that may occur during this operation.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `protocol` object may not always have the `transport` attribute, which can lead to an AttributeError when the `write` method is called on it.

To fix the bug, it's important to handle potential exceptions and make sure that the `transport` attribute exists before trying to write to it.

Here's the corrected code for the `requestTunnel` function:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost, self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    
    # Check if protocol contains the transport attribute before writing to it
    if hasattr(protocol, 'transport') and protocol.transport:
        try:
            protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)
            self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
            protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
            self._protocol = protocol
        except Exception as e:
            # Handle the exception, log the error, or raise an appropriate error
            print(f"An error occurred while writing to protocol transport: {e}")
    else:
        # Handle the case where protocol does not have the transport attribute
        print("Protocol does not have transport attribute")
        
    return protocol
```
