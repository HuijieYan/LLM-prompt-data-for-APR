The error message indicates that a `TypeError` occurred at the `tunnelReq = 'CONNECT ...'` line inside the `requestTunnel` function. This suggests that the `tunnelReq` variable, which is generated by concatenating several strings, is inadvertently assigned a unicode value instead of being a `bytes` type.

The input parameter runtime values and types show that `self._tunneledHost` has a value of `b'no-such-domain.nosuch'`, which is a `bytes` type. However, when it is concatenated with other strings to form `tunnelReq`, the resulting `tunnelReq` value is being inferred as a `unicode` type instead of a `bytes` type.

To fix this issue, it's essential to ensure that all concatenated strings result in a `bytes` object. In this case, `tunnelReq` should be encoded to a `bytes` object before using it further.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = b'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost, self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += b'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader.encode('utf-8')
    tunnelReq += b'\r\n'
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```

In the corrected code, `tunnelReq` and `self._proxyAuthHeader` are explicitly encoded to `bytes` objects using the `encode` method. This guarantees that the resulting `tunnelReq` is a `bytes` object and avoids type errors when interacting with the protocol's transport.
