The potential error in the `requestTunnel` function is that it is trying to modify the `protocol.dataReceived` attribute directly, which may not be valid and can lead to unexpected behavior.

The bug occurs because the `requestTunnel` function is trying to directly assign a new function to the `protocol.dataReceived` attribute, which may not be the correct way to modify the behavior of the protocol.

To fix this bug, a possible approach is to subclass the `HTTP11ClientProtocol` and override the `dataReceived` method to handle the proxy response. Then, the `requestTunnel` function can instantiate this subclass and assign it to the protocol.

Here's the corrected code for the `requestTunnel` function:

```python
class TunnelingTCP4ClientEndpoint(TCP4ClientEndpoint):

    # other methods...

    def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
        """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
        class ProxyHandlingProtocol(protocol):
            def dataReceived(self, bytes):
                # handle proxy response
                # ... omitted code ...
                pass

        tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost, self._tunneledPort)
        if self._proxyAuthHeader:
            tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
        tunnelReq += '\r\n'
        protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)

        # Create an instance of the subclass with modified dataReceived method
        modified_protocol = ProxyHandlingProtocol(protocol)
        self._protocol = modified_protocol
        return modified_protocol
```

In the corrected code, a new subclass `ProxyHandlingProtocol` is defined with a modified `dataReceived` method to handle the proxy response. The `requestTunnel` function instantiates this subclass and assigns it to `self._protocol`.
