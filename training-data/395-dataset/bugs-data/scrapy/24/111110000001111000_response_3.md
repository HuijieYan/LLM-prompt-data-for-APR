    An endpoint that tunnels through proxies to allow HTTPS downloads. To
    accomplish that, this endpoint sends an HTTP CONNECT to the proxy.
    The HTTP CONNECT is always sent when using this endpoint, I think this could
    be improved as the CONNECT will be redundant if the connection associated
    with this endpoint comes from the pool and a CONNECT has already been issued
    for it.
