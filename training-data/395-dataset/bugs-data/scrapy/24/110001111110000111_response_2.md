The error message indicates a TypeError related to unicode data, which is likely caused by an incorrect encoding or handling of the data in the `requestTunnel` function. This error suggests that the protocol's transport is encountering a unicode data-related issue.

To fix this bug, you can modify the `requestTunnel` function to ensure that unicode data is properly handled. This might involve encoding or decoding the data to match the expected format.

Here's the corrected `requestTunnel` function:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost, self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    
    if isinstance(tunnelReq, str):
        tunnelReq = tunnelReq.encode('utf-8')  # Ensure tunnelReq is in bytes

    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```

In this corrected approach, we ensure that `tunnelReq` is encoded to bytes if it is initially a string, which avoids any unicode-related issues when writing it to the protocol's transport.
