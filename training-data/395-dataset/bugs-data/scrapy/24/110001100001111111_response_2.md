The buggy function is `requestTunnel`. The purpose of this function is to send a HTTP CONNECT request to the proxy server to open a tunnel. The issue seems to be with the dataReceived assignment and the handling of protocol data.

The error is likely occurring because when `protocol.dataReceived` is assigned `self.processProxyResponse`, the original `dataReceived` method of the protocol is lost. This causes issues when receiving and processing the response from the server.

To fix this bug, the original `dataReceived` method should be saved before assigning a new method to it, and then the saved method should be called explicitly when needed.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost, self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    self._originalDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived  # Save the original dataReceived method
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse  # Assign the new method
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```

In this corrected code, the original `dataReceived` method is saved in `self._originalDataReceived` before assigning a new method. When needed, the original `dataReceived` method can be called explicitly using `self._originalDataReceived(bodyBytes)`.
