The error in the `requestTunnel` function is likely due to the use of `protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)` without checking if the transport is connected before writing to it. This can lead to an error if the transport is not yet connected.

To fix this bug, you can modify the `requestTunnel` function to check if the transport is connected before writing to it. If it's not connected, wait until it's connected before sending the tunnel request.

Here's the corrected code for the `requestTunnel` function:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost,
                                              self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'

    # Check if the transport is connected
    if protocol.transport and protocol.transport.connected:
        protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)
    else:
        # If not connected, add a callback to write the tunnel request once the connection is made
        def writeTunnelRequest(ignored):
            protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)
        protocol.transport.connecting.addCallback(writeTunnelRequest)
    
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```

With this modification, the `requestTunnel` function will first check if the transport is connected and then write the tunnel request. If the transport is not yet connected, it will add a callback to write the tunnel request once the connection is made. This should fix the potential error caused by writing to the transport before it's connected.
