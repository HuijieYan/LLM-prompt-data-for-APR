Please fix the function/method provided below and provide the corrected function/method as the output.


# Buggy function source code
```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class TunnelingTCP4ClientEndpoint(TCP4ClientEndpoint):
    """
    An endpoint that tunnels through proxies to allow HTTPS downloads. To
    accomplish that, this endpoint sends an HTTP CONNECT to the proxy.
    The HTTP CONNECT is always sent when using this endpoint, I think this could
    be improved as the CONNECT will be redundant if the connection associated
    with this endpoint comes from the pool and a CONNECT has already been issued
    for it.
