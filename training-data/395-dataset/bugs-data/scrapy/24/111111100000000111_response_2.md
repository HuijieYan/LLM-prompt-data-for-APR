The potential error in the `requestTunnel` method is that it is attempting to assign the `dataReceived` method of the `protocol` to `processProxyResponse`, and then returning the protocol. However, the original `dataReceived` method is not being saved, so it cannot be restored later.

The reason behind the bug is that the `dataReceived` method of the `protocol` is being overwritten with `processProxyResponse`, and there is no way to restore the original `dataReceived` method.

To fix this bug, we can save the original `dataReceived` method before overwriting it with `processProxyResponse` and then restore it after the tunnel request is made.

Here is the corrected code for the `requestTunnel` method:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost, self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    original_dataReceived = protocol.dataReceived  # Save the original dataReceived method
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol

    # Restore original dataReceived method after the tunnel request
    def restore_data_received(self):
        if self._protocol:
            self._protocol.dataReceived = self._protocolDataReceived
```
