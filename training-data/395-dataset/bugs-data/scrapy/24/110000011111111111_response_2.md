Upon analyzing the information provided, it is evident that the error message traceback indicates that the issue is related to the data type being used. The bug exists in the `requestTunnel` method, which is responsible for creating a tunnel request. The error message indicates that the data must not be Unicode, and this is likely due to the fact that the `tunnelReq` variable is encoded as `bytes`.

The issue arises because `protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)` expects the `tunnelReq` data to be a byte string, but the bug causes it to be another type. To fix this, the function should ensure that the `tunnelReq` variable is correctly encoded as a byte string before writing it.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to encode the `tunnelReq` variable as UTF-8 using the `encode()` method, which will convert it into the required byte string format.

Here's the corrected code for the `requestTunnel` method:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = ('CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost.decode('utf-8'), self._tunneledPort)).encode('utf-8')
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += ('Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader.encode('utf-8'))
    tunnelReq += b'\r\n'
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```

With this correction, the `tunnelReq` variable is encoded as a byte string using UTF-8 encoding, ensuring that the `protocol.transport.write()` method receives the data in the correct format.
