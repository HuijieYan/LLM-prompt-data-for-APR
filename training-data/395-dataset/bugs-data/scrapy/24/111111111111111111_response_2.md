The error message suggests that there is an issue with the data being a unicode string when it should not be. This indicates that the `tunnelReq` variable in the `requestTunnel` method is being treated as a unicode string instead of bytes, which is causing the failure when writing the data using `protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)`.

In the `requestTunnel` method, the `tunnelReq` variable is defined with the `bytes` type, but there is no encoding specified for the string formatting operation. Due to this, it is inferred as a Unicode string. To fix this, the formatting operation should explicitly encode the string using the specified encoding, for example, UTF-8.

Here's the corrected code for the `requestTunnel` method considering the potential issues:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost.decode('utf-8'), self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq.encode('utf-8'))
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```

In the corrected code, the `tunnelReq` string is explicitly encoded using UTF-8 before writing to the transport, ensuring that it is treated as bytes and resolving the unicode-related error.
