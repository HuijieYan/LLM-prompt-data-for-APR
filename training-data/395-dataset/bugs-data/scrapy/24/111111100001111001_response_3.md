The buggy function `requestTunnel` is attempting to send an HTTP CONNECT request to open a tunnel through a proxy, but it is encountering an error.

Based on the provided test case, it seems that the error occurs when `protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)` is called within the `requestTunnel` function. The error may be related to the type or format of the `tunnelReq` variable being passed to the `write` method.

The reason behind the bug could be related to the `tunnelReq` variable not being in the correct format or type when passed to `protocol.transport.write`. 

To fix the issue, the `tunnelReq` variable should be converted to a compatible format before being passed to the `write` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `requestTunnel` function:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = b'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost, self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += b'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader.encode('utf-8')
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```

In the corrected code, `tunnelReq` is converted to bytes format using `b''` and the `.encode('utf-8')` method is applied to the `self._proxyAuthHeader` to ensure it is in the correct format before being appended to `tunnelReq`.

This should address the bug and ensure that the `tunnelReq` variable is passed to the `write` method in the correct format.
