The error message indicates that there is an issue related to data type; specifically, the data must not be unicode. This issue is occurring within the `requestTunnel` function of the `TunnelingTCP4ClientEndpoint` class. The error occurs when data is being written to the transport in this function.

The reason for this bug is that the code is attempting to write a unicode string to the transport's `write` method, which expects a byte string. This results in a `TypeError` as the data type is incorrect.

To fix this issue, the unicode string being written to the transport needs to be encoded as a byte string before being sent.

Here's the corrected code for the `requestTunnel` function:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost,
                                              self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq.encode('utf-8'))  # Encode the string to bytes
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
``` 

By encoding `tunnelReq` as UTF-8 bytes before writing it to the transport, the `TypeError` related to unicode data being sent to the transport should be resolved.
