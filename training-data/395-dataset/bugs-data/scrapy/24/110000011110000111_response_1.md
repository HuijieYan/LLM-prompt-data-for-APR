The error message indicates a `TypeError` related to the data being unicode, which typically occurs when trying to write a unicode string to a write method that expects bytes.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)`. It seems that `tunnelReq` is unicode, and the `write` method expects bytes.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that `tunnelReq` is being formatted using `%s` placeholders, which can result in a unicode string, and this string is being passed to `protocol.transport.write`, which expects bytes.

To fix the bug, we should encode the `tunnelReq` string into bytes before passing it to `protocol.transport.write`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost, self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    tunnelReq = tunnelReq.encode('utf-8')  # Encode the string into bytes
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```
