The error message is indicating that the data must not be Unicode, which suggests that the dataReceived function is not handling Unicode properly. 

Looking at the provided function, the requestTunnel method seems to be modifying the dataReceived method of the protocol. However, the modification might be causing issues with handling Unicode data.

To fix this bug, we need to update the requestTunnel method to properly handle the data transference in the protocol, ensuring that Unicode data is handled correctly. 

Here's the corrected code for the requestTunnel method:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost,
                                              self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    
    # Encode tunnel request to bytes before writing to the transport
    tunnelReq = tunnelReq.encode('utf-8')
    
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)
    
    # Replace dataReceived method with the original after writing the tunnel request
    protocol.dataReceived = self._protocolDataReceived
    
    # Set the protocol for further use
    self._protocol = protocol
    
    return protocol
```

In the corrected code, the tunnel request is encoded to bytes using UTF-8 encoding before writing it to the protocol's transport. Additionally, the dataReceived method is restored to its original state after writing the tunnel request, ensuring that Unicode handling is maintained. This should resolve the bug related to handling Unicode data in the protocol.
