The error occurs because the test function is expecting a ValueError to be raised when the `follow` function is called with a `None` value for the `url`, but the `follow` function does not currently raise a ValueError in this scenario.

The potential error location is within the `follow` function's code for handling the `url` parameter.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `follow` function does not handle the case when the `url` parameter is `None` and instead tries to process it as a valid URL.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to add a check at the beginning of the `follow` function to raise a ValueError if the `url` parameter is `None` or an empty string.

Here's the corrected code for the `follow` function:

```python
def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
           cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
           dont_filter=False, errback=None):
    if url is None or url == '':
        raise ValueError("Invalid URL: {}".format(url))
    
    if isinstance(url, Link):
        url = url.url
    url = self.urljoin(url)
    return Request(url, callback,
                   method=method,
                   headers=headers,
                   body=body,
                   cookies=cookies,
                   meta=meta,
                   encoding=encoding,
                   priority=priority,
                   dont_filter=dont_filter,
                   errback=errback)
```

With this correction, the `follow` function will now raise a ValueError when called with `None` or an empty string as the `url` parameter.
