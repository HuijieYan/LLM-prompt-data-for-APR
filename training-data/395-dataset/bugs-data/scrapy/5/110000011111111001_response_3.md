Potential Error Location:
The error is likely occurring in the follow function, specifically when the input parameter 'url' is None. This would lead to an error when attempting to execute the line `url = self.urljoin(url)`.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where the input parameter 'url' is None. This results in an error when trying to call the method urljoin on a None.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to check if the input parameter 'url' is None before performing any operations on it. If 'url' is None, we should handle this case appropriately, such as raising a ValueError.

Corrected Code:

```python
from scrapy.http import Response, Request
from scrapy.link import Link

def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
           cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
           dont_filter=False, errback=None):
    # type: (...) -> Request
    """
    Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
    It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
    but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
    not only an absolute URL.
    
    :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow` 
    method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
    and Link objects.
    """
    if url is None:
        raise ValueError("URL cannot be None")
    
    if isinstance(url, Link):
        url = url.url
    url = self.urljoin(url)
    return Request(url, callback,
                   method=method,
                   headers=headers,
                   body=body,
