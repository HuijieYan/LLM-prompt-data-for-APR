Potential Error Location: 
The error is likely occurring in the line `url = self.urljoin(url)` where the `urljoin` method is being called. 

Reasons behind the Bug:
The `urljoin` method is being called directly on the class instance `self` without passing the `url` argument explicitly.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to either create an instance of the `urljoin` method within the `follow` method or use the correct syntax to call the existing `urljoin` method.

Corrected Code:
```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class Response(object_ref):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def meta(self):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def urljoin(self, url):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # this is the corrected version of the buggy function
    def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
               cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
               dont_filter=False, errback=None):
        # type: (...) -> Request
        """
        Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
        It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
        but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
        not only an absolute URL.
        
        :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow` 
        method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
        and Link objects.

        if isinstance(url, Link):
            url = url.url
        # creating an instance of the urljoin method
        response = Response()
        url = response.urljoin(url)
