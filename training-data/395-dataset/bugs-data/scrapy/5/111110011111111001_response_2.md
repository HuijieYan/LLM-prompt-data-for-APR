The error message indicates that a ValueError should have been raised when calling the follow method with a None value for the url parameter, but it was not.

The potential error location within the follow method is when the url variable is defined and manipulated. It seems that the logic for handling a None value for the url parameter is missing.

The bug occurred because there is no check for a None value in the url parameter. The follow method assumes that the url parameter will always have a valid value, resulting in a ValueError not being raised when it is None.

To fix the bug, a check for a None value in the url parameter should be added at the beginning of the follow method. If the url parameter is None, a ValueError should be raised. If it is not None, then the rest of the method can proceed as usual.

Here is the corrected code for the follow method:

```python
def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
           cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
           dont_filter=False, errback=None):
    # type: (...) -> Request
    """
    Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
    It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
    but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
    not only an absolute URL.

    :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow`
    method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
    and Link objects.
    """
    if url is None:
        raise ValueError("URL cannot be None")
    
    if isinstance(url, Link):
        url = url.url
    url = self.urljoin(url)
    return Request(url, callback,
                   method=method,
                   headers=headers,
                   body=body,
                   cookies=cookies,
                   meta=meta,
                   encoding=encoding,
                   priority=priority,
                   dont_filter=dont_filter,
                   errback=errback)
```
