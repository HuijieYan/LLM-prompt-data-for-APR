The issue is with the `follow` method within the provided code. The problem is that the method doesn't handle cases where the `url` parameter is `None` or an empty string. When this happens, the method should raise an exception instead of trying to crawl the current page again.

To fix this issue, the `follow` method should include a check for the `url` parameter and raise an exception if it is `None` or an empty string.

Here's the corrected code for the `follow` method:

```python
    def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
               cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
               dont_filter=False, errback=None):
        # type: (...) -> Request
        """
        Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
        It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
        but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
        not only an absolute URL.

        :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow`
        method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
        and Link objects.
        """
        if url is None or url == '':
            raise ValueError("Invalid URL")
        
        if isinstance(url, Link):
            url = url.url
        url = self.urljoin(url)
        return Request(url, callback,
                       method=method,
                       headers=headers,
                       body=body,
                       cookies=cookies,
                       meta=meta,
                       encoding=encoding,
                       priority=priority,
                       dont_filter=dont_filter,
                       errback=errback)
```
