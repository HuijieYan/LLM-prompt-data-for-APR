The issue seems to be with the `follow` method in the `Response` class. The test case `test_follow_None_url` is expecting a `ValueError` to be raised when `r.follow` is called with `None`, but currently, the `follow` method does not raise any exceptions when `url` is `None`.

The potential error location is within the `follow` method, as it needs to check if the `url` is `None` and raise a `ValueError` in that case.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `follow` method does not handle the case when `url` is `None` and it tries to proceed with the request, which results in unexpected behavior.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to add a check at the beginning of the `follow` method to raise a `ValueError` if the `url` is `None` or an empty string.

After fixing the bug, the corrected code for the `follow` method is as follows:

```python
# corrected follow method
def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
           cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
           dont_filter=False, errback=None):
    # type: (...) -> Request
    """
    Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
    It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
    but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
    not only an absolute URL.
    
    :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow` 
    method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
    and Link objects.
    """
    if url is None or url == '':
        raise ValueError("Invalid URL")
    
    if isinstance(url, Link):
        url = url.url
    url = self.urljoin(url)
    return Request(url, callback,
                   method=method,
                   headers=headers,
                   body=body,
                   cookies=cookies,
                   meta=meta,
                   encoding=encoding,
                   priority=priority,
                   dont_filter=dont_filter,
                   errback=errback)
```

With this correction, the `follow` method will now raise a `ValueError` if `url` is `None` or an empty string, as expected by the test case.
