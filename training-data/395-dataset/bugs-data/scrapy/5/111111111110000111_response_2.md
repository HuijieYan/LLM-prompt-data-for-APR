Potential error location: The error seems to be occurring in the `follow` method of the `Response` class, as it is not raising a ValueError when `url` is None.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `follow` method within the `Response` class is not properly handling the case when `url` is None. This causes the `self.urljoin(url)` call to throw an error, leading to the test failure.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Add a check at the beginning of the `follow` method to raise a ValueError if `url` is None.
2. Modify the `follow` method to handle the case when `url` is None gracefully, without attempting to process it with `self.urljoin(url)`.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
           cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
           dont_filter=False, errback=None):
    if url is None:
        raise ValueError("Cannot follow a None URL")
    
    if isinstance(url, Link):
        url = url.url
    url = self.urljoin(url)
    return Request(url, callback,
                   method=method,
                   headers=headers,
                   body=body,
                   cookies=cookies,
                   meta=meta,
                   encoding=encoding,
                   priority=priority,
                   dont_filter=dont_filter,
                   errback=errback)
```
