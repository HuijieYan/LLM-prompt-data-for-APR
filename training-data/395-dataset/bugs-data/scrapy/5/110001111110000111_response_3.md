The error message is indicating that the ValueError is not being raised when the `follow` function is called with a None value for the `url`. This means that the `follow` function is not handling the case where the `url` is None properly.

The potential error location within the `follow` function is likely the line `url = self.urljoin(url)`, where the `urljoin` method is being called. It seems that the `urljoin` method is not handling the case where the `url` is None.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `follow` function is not properly handling the case where the `url` is None, and it is trying to process it as if it were a valid URL.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to add a check at the beginning of the `follow` function to raise a ValueError if the `url` is None. This check will prevent the function from proceeding with the rest of the logic if the `url` is not valid.

Here's the corrected code for the `follow` function:

```python
def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
           cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
           dont_filter=False, errback=None):
    if url is None:
        raise ValueError("Cannot follow a None URL")

    if isinstance(url, Link):
        url = url.url
    url = self.urljoin(url)
    return Request(url, callback,
                   method=method,
                   headers=headers,
                   body=body,
                   cookies=cookies,
                   meta=meta,
                   encoding=encoding,
                   priority=priority,
                   dont_filter=dont_filter,
                   errback=errback)
```
