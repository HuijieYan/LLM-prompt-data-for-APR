The error message from the test function indicates that the ValueError is not being raised when the follow function is called with a None url. This means that the follow function is not handling the case when the url parameter is None correctly.

The potential error location within the follow function is at the start where the url parameter is being processed.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the follow function should raise a ValueError when called with a None url, but it is not doing so. This is causing the test case to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check at the beginning of the follow function to raise a ValueError if the url parameter is None.

Here's the corrected code for the follow function:

```python
def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
           cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
           dont_filter=False, errback=None):
    # type: (...) -> Request
    """
    Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
    It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
    but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
    not only an absolute URL.

    :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow`
    method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
    and Link objects.
    """
    if url is None:
        raise ValueError("URL cannot be None")

    if isinstance(url, Link):
        url = url.url
    url = self.urljoin(url)
    return Request(url, callback,
                   method=method,
                   headers=headers,
                   body=body,
                   cookies=cookies,
                   meta=meta,
                   encoding=encoding,
                   priority=priority,
                   dont_filter=dont_filter,
                   errback=errback)
```

With this correction, the follow function now checks if the url parameter is None and raises a ValueError in that case. This will fix the issue reported in the test case, and the function will behave as expected.
