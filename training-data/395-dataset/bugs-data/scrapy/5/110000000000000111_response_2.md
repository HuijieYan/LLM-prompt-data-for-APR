Potential Error Location:
The error may be occurring when the `follow` function is called with an empty string or None as the `url` parameter. The function does not handle these cases and may be attempting to crawl the current page again.

Reasons Behind the Bug:
The `follow` function does not have any handling for cases where the `url` parameter is an empty string or None. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as crawling the current page again.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Add a check at the beginning of the function to raise an exception if the `url` parameter is an empty string or None.
2. Modify the function to handle these cases gracefully, potentially by returning early with an appropriate error message.

Corrected Code:

```python
def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
           cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
           dont_filter=False, errback=None):
    # type: (...) -> Request
    """
    Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
    It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
    but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
    not only an absolute URL.
    
    :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow` 
    method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
    and Link objects.
    """
    if url is None or url == '':
        raise ValueError("The 'url' parameter cannot be None or an empty string.")

    if isinstance(url, Link):
        url = url.url
    url = self.urljoin(url)
    return Request(url, callback,
                   method=method,
                   headers=headers,
                   body=body,
                   cookies=cookies,
                   meta=meta,
                   encoding=encoding,
                   priority=priority,
                   dont_filter=dont_filter,
