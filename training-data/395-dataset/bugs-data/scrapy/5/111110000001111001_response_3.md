The potential error in the `follow` function is that it uses `self.urljoin` without actually calling it as a method. This is likely to cause an AttributeError since `self.urljoin` is a method and should be called as `self.urljoin()`.

To fix the bug, we can simply call `self.urljoin(url)` instead of `self.urljoin` in the `follow` function.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class Response(object_ref):
    # ... omitted code ...


    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def meta(self):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def urljoin(self, url):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass



    # the corrected function
    def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
               cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
               dont_filter=False, errback=None):
        # type: (...) -> Request
        """
        Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
        It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
        but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
        not only an absolute URL.
        
        :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow` 
        method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
        and Link objects.
        """
        if isinstance(url, Link):
            url = url.url
        # call self.urljoin as a method
        url = self.urljoin(url)
        return Request(url, callback,
                       method=method,
                       headers=headers,
