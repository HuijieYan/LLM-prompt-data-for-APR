Potential Error Location:
The error is likely occurring in the `follow` method, specifically when it tries to use the `urljoin` method without referencing it correctly.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The `urljoin` method is being called directly as `self.urljoin`, but it should be called on the `Response` object instead.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the method call to use `self` as the object on which the `urljoin` method is called.
2. Ensure that the `url` parameter is not None before attempting to use it.

Corrected Code:
```python
def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
           cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
           dont_filter=False, errback=None):
    # type: (...) -> Request
    """
    Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
    It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
    but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
    not only an absolute URL.

    :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow`
    method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
    and Link objects.
    """
    if url is None:
        raise ValueError("URL cannot be None")
    
    if isinstance(url, Link):
        url = url.url
    url = self.urljoin(url)  # Corrected by using self to call the urljoin method on the Response object
    return Request(url, callback,
                   method=method,
                   headers=headers,
                   body=body,
                   cookies=cookies,
                   meta=meta,
                   encoding=encoding,
                   priority=priority,
                   dont_filter=dont_filter,
                   errback=errback)
