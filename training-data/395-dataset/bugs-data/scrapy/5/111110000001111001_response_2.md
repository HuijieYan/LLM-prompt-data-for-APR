Potential error location: The error might be in the line `url = self.urljoin(url)`. It seems that `self.urljoin()` is being treated as a method, but it is defined as a function in the class.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The `urljoin` method is being called as an instance method of the class, but it is defined as a standalone method in the class. This is causing the error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We need to change the way the `urljoin` method is being called. Since it is defined as a method of the class, it should be called using the `self` keyword.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the fixed function
class Response(object_ref):
    # ... omitted code ...


    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def meta(self):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def urljoin(self, url):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass



    # this is the fixed function
    def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
               cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
               dont_filter=False, errback=None):
        # type: (...) -> Request
        """
        Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
        It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
        but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
        not only an absolute URL.
        
        :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow` 
        method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
        and Link objects.
        """
        if isinstance(url, Link):
            url = url.url
        url = self.urljoin(url)
        return Request(url, callback,
                       method=method,
                       headers=headers,
                       body=body,
                       cookies=cookies,
                       meta=meta,
                       encoding=encoding,
                       priority=priority,
                       dont_filter=dont_filter,
                       errback=errback)
```
In the corrected code, the `urljoin` method is being called using `self.urljoin()`, which is consistent with the way it is defined in the class.
