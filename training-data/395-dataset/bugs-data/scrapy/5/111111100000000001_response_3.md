The potential error in the `follow` function lies in the line `url = self.urljoin(url)`. This is because the `urljoin` method is not defined within the `Response` class, which will result in an AttributeError.

The reason for the bug is that the `urljoin` method is being called on the instance of the `Response` class, but the `urljoin` method is not defined within the class. It seems that the intention is to call the global `urljoin` function, but since the function is not imported or defined within the class, it is causing the error.

To fix the bug, we need to call the global `urljoin` function instead of the method within the `Response` class.

Here's the corrected code for the `follow` function:

```python
def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
           cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
           dont_filter=False, errback=None):
    # type: (...) -> Request
    """
    Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
    It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
    but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
    not only an absolute URL.
    
    :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow` 
    method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
    and Link objects.
    """
    if isinstance(url, Link):
        url = url.url
    url = urljoin(self, url)  # calling the global urljoin function
    return Request(url, callback,
                   method=method,
                   headers=headers,
                   body=body,
                   cookies=cookies,
                   meta=meta,
                   encoding=encoding,
                   priority=priority,
                   dont_filter=dont_filter,
                   errback=errback)
```
