The error in the `follow` method is likely caused by the fact that it attempts to call `self.urljoin()`, but the `urljoin` method is not defined within the `Response` class. This results in an AttributeError when trying to call `self.urljoin()`.

To fix the bug, the `urljoin` method should be defined within the `Response` class. The corrected code for the `follow` method is given below:

```python
class Response(object_ref):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def meta(self):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def urljoin(self, url):
        # Define the logic of the urljoin method here
        pass

    # this is the corrected function
    def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
               cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
               dont_filter=False, errback=None):
        # type: (...) -> Request
        """
        Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
        It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
        but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
        not only an absolute URL.
        
        :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow` 
        method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
        and Link objects.
        """
        if isinstance(url, Link):
            url = url.url
        url = self.urljoin(url)
        return Request(url, callback,
                       method=method,
                       headers=headers,
                       body=body,
                       cookies=cookies,
                       meta=meta,
                       encoding=encoding,
                       priority=priority,
                       dont_filter=dont_filter,
                       errback=errback)
```

By defining the `urljoin` method within the `Response` class, the `follow` method will be able to successfully call `self.urljoin(url)`.
