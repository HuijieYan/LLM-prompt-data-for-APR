The potential error in the `follow` method is the use of `self.urljoin(url)` where `self` is an instance of `Response` and `urljoin` is a method. The method `urljoin` should be called on `self` with `url` as a parameter, instead of calling it as a separate method.

The reason for the bug is that `urljoin` is being called as a separate method without the `self` instance, resulting in a TypeError.

To fix the bug, we need to call the `urljoin` method on the `Response` instance `self` with the `url` parameter. The corrected code is as follows:

```python
def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
           cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
           dont_filter=False, errback=None):
    # type: (...) -> Request
    """
    Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
    It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
    but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
    not only an absolute URL.
    
    :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow` 
    method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
    and Link objects.
    """
    if isinstance(url, Link):
        url = url.url
    url = self.urljoin(url)  # Fix: Call the urljoin method on the self instance
    url = self._urljoin(url)  # the corrected code
    return Request(url, callback,
                   method=method,
                   headers=headers,
                   body=body,
                   cookies=cookies,
                   meta=meta,
                   encoding=encoding,
                   priority=priority,
                   dont_filter=dont_filter,
                   errback=errback)
```
