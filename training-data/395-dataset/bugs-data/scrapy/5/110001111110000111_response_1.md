1. The test case is trying to ensure that the `follow` method raises a `ValueError` when called with a `None` url. However, the test is failing and not raising the expected exception.

2. The potential error location within the `follow` method is the line where `url = self.urljoin(url)` is called.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `follow` method is not handling the case when the `url` parameter is `None` properly, resulting in the unexpected behavior.

4. One possible approach for fixing the bug is to add a check at the beginning of the `follow` method to raise a `ValueError` if the `url` parameter is `None` or an empty string.

5. Below is the corrected code for the `follow` method:

```python
    def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
               cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
               dont_filter=False, errback=None):
        # type: (...) -> Request
        """
        Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
        It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
        but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
        not only an absolute URL.
        
        :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow` 
        method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
        and Link objects.
        """
        if url is None or url == "":
            raise ValueError("url cannot be None or empty")
          
        if isinstance(url, Link):
            url = url.url
        url = self.urljoin(url)
        return Request(url, callback,
                       method=method,
                       headers=headers,
                       body=body,
                       cookies=cookies,
                       meta=meta,
                       encoding=encoding,
                       priority=priority,
                       dont_filter=dont_filter,
                       errback=errback)
```
By adding the check `if url is None or url == "":` at the beginning of the `follow` method, we ensure that a `ValueError` is raised if the `url` parameter is `None` or an empty string.
