The bug in the code is occurring because the `url` parameter is being set as `None` in the `r.follow` method call from the test function `test_follow_None_url`. This is causing the `ValueError` to not be raised as expected.

To fix this bug, the `r.follow` method needs to handle the case where the `url` parameter is `None` and raise a `ValueError` in such cases. Additionally, the `url` should be set to an empty string in these cases.

Here's the corrected code for the `follow` method:

```python
def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
               cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
               dont_filter=False, errback=None):
        # type: (...) -> Request
        """
        Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
        It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
        but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
        not only an absolute URL.
        
        :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow` 
        method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
        and Link objects.
        """
        if url is None:
            raise ValueError('URL cannot be None')
        
        if isinstance(url, Link):
            url = url.url
        url = self.urljoin(url)
        return Request(url, callback,
                       method=method,
                       headers=headers,
                       body=body,
                       cookies=cookies,
                       meta=meta,
                       encoding=encoding,
                       priority=priority,
                       dont_filter=dont_filter,
                       errback=errback)
```
