The potential error location within the `follow` function is on the line `url = self.urljoin(url)`.

The error occurs because the `urljoin` function is called as a method of the class `Response` (`self.urljoin(url)`), but it is declared as a standalone function in the module. This means that the `urljoin` function is not accessible as a method of the class, which causes the function to fail.

To fix this bug, the `urljoin` function needs to be moved inside the `Response` class, and the call to `self.urljoin(url)` can then be made.

Here's the corrected code for the `follow` function:

```python
def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
           cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
           dont_filter=False, errback=None):
    # type: (...) -> Request
    """
    Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
    It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
    but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
    not only an absolute URL.
    
    :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow` 
    method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
    and Link objects.
    """
    if isinstance(url, Link):
        url = url.url
    url = self._urljoin(url)
    return Request(url, callback,
                   method=method,
                   headers=headers,
                   body=body,
                   cookies=cookies,
                   meta=meta,
                   encoding=encoding,
                   priority=priority,
                   dont_filter=dont_filter,
                   errback=errback)

def _urljoin(self, url):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass
