The potential error location within the problematic function is the `follow` method which is not raising a ValueError when `url` is None.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `follow` method is not handling the case when the `url` parameter is None. This results in the `url` getting passed as None to the `Request` constructor, which leads to unexpected behavior in the code.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to add a check at the beginning of the `follow` method to raise a ValueError if the `url` is None. This would ensure that the method does not continue with a None value for the `url`.

Here's the corrected code for the `follow` method:

```python
def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
           cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
           dont_filter=False, errback=None):
    if url is None:
        raise ValueError("URL cannot be None")
    
    if isinstance(url, Link):
        url = url.url
    url = self.urljoin(url)
    
    return Request(url, callback,
                   method=method,
                   headers=headers,
                   body=body,
                   cookies=cookies,
                   meta=meta,
                   encoding=encoding,
                   priority=priority,
                   dont_filter=dont_filter,
                   errback=errback)
```

With this correction, the `follow` method will raise a ValueError if the `url` is None, as required by the GitHub issue title and its associated detailed issue description.
