The potential error in the `follow` function is the handling of the `url` parameter. The function is supposed to return a `Request` instance to follow a link, but it does not handle the case when `url` is None or an empty string. Instead, it considers `url` as an instance of `Link`, converts it to a URL, and returns a `Request` instance using that URL. This behavior might lead to crawling the base page again if the `url` is None or an empty string, which is not the intended functionality.

To fix this issue, we need to add a check for the validity of the `url` parameter. If the `url` is None or an empty string, we should raise an exception indicating that the `url` is invalid.

Here's the corrected code for the `follow` function:

```python
def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
           cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
           dont_filter=False, errback=None):
    # type: (...) -> Request
    """
    Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
    It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
    but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
    not only an absolute URL.

    :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow`
    method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
    and Link objects.
    """
    if url is None or url == "":
        raise ValueError("Invalid URL")
  
    if isinstance(url, Link):
        url = url.url
    url = self.urljoin(url)
    return Request(url, callback,
                   method=method,
                   headers=headers,
                   body=body,
                   cookies=cookies,
                   meta=meta,
                   encoding=encoding,
                   priority=priority,
                   dont_filter=dont_filter,
                   errback=errback)
```

With this change, if the `url` parameter is None or an empty string, the function will raise a `ValueError` indicating that the URL is invalid, instead of proceeding with the crawling of the base page again.
