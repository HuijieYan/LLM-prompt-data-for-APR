The potential error location within the buggy function is the line where the url is being checked for being an instance of Link before being processed with self.urljoin(url).

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where the input URL is None or an empty string. As a result, it tries to process None or an empty string as a Link object which leads to unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the cases where the input URL is None or an empty string and raise an exception instead of trying to process it as a Link object.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
    def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
               cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
               dont_filter=False, errback=None):
        # type: (...) -> Request
        """
        Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
        It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
        but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
        not only an absolute URL.
        
        :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow` 
        method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
        and Link objects.
        """
        if url is None or url == '':
            raise ValueError("Invalid URL provided")
        
        if isinstance(url, Link):
            url = url.url
        url = self.urljoin(url)
        return Request(url, callback,
                       method=method,
                       headers=headers,
                       body=body,
                       cookies=cookies,
                       meta=meta,
                       encoding=encoding,
                       priority=priority,
                       dont_filter=dont_filter,
                       errback=errback)
```
