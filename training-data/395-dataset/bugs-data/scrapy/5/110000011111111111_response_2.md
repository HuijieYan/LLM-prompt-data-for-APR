The test case "test_follow_None_url" is trying to test if the "follow" function raises a ValueError when called with a None URL. However, the error message indicates that the ValueError is not being raised.

The potential error location within the "follow" function is at the beginning where it does not handle the case when the "url" parameter is None.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function does not have proper handling for the case when the "url" parameter is None, leading to unexpected behavior when trying to follow a None URL.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to add a check at the beginning of the "follow" function to raise a ValueError if the "url" parameter is None.

Here's the corrected code for the "follow" function:

```python
def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
           cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
           dont_filter=False, errback=None):
    # type: (...) -> Request
    """
    Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
    It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
    but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
    not only an absolute URL.
    
    :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow` 
    method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
    and Link objects.
    """
    if url is None:
        raise ValueError("URL cannot be None")
    if isinstance(url, Link):
        url = url.url
    url = self.urljoin(url)
    return Request(url, callback,
                   method=method,
                   headers=headers,
                   body=body,
                   cookies=cookies,
                   meta=meta,
                   encoding=encoding,
                   priority=priority,
                   dont_filter=dont_filter,
                   errback=errback)
```
