The potential error in the provided code is in the follow function. The url parameter is being processed without any validation for empty or None values, which could lead to unexpected behavior such as crawling the current page again.

The reason for the bug is that the code does not handle empty or None values for the url parameter, and it tries to process them without any validation.

To fix the bug, we can add a check at the beginning of the follow function to raise an exception when the url parameter is empty or None. This will prevent the function from processing invalid or unexpected values for the url.

Here's the corrected code for the follow function:

```python
def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
           cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
           dont_filter=False, errback=None):
    # type: (...) -> Request
    """
    Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
    It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
    but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
    not only an absolute URL.

    :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow`
    method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
    and Link objects.
    """

    if url is None or url == '':
        raise ValueError("Invalid URL")

    if isinstance(url, Link):
        url = url.url
    url = self.urljoin(url)
    return Request(url, callback,
                   method=method,
                   headers=headers,
                   body=body,
                   cookies=cookies,
                   meta=meta,
                   encoding=encoding,
                   priority=priority,
                   dont_filter=dont_filter,
                   errback=errback)
```

With these changes, the follow function will now raise a ValueError when the url parameter is empty or None, preventing unexpected behavior in the code. This will address the bug and ensure that the function handles invalid url inputs appropriately.
