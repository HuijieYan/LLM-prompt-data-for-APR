The potential error in the given function is that it does not handle the cases when the 'url' parameter is None or an empty string. This can cause unexpected behavior, such as crawling the current page again, as mentioned in the GitHub issue title and description.

The reason behind this bug is that the function does not handle the edge cases of 'url' being None or an empty string. As a result, it does not raise an exception or handle these cases in a meaningful way.

To fix this bug, the function should check if the 'url' parameter is None or an empty string and raise an exception in those cases.

Here is the corrected code for the 'follow' function:

```python
def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
           cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
           dont_filter=False, errback=None):
    # type: (...) -> Request
    """
    Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
    It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
    but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
    not only an absolute URL.
    
    :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow` 
    method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
    and Link objects.
    """
    if url is None or url == '':
        raise ValueError("URL cannot be None or empty")
    
    if isinstance(url, Link):
        url = url.url
    url = self.urljoin(url)
    return Request(url, callback,
                   method=method,
                   headers=headers,
                   body=body,
                   cookies=cookies,
                   meta=meta,
                   encoding=encoding,
                   priority=priority,
                   dont_filter=dont_filter,
                   errback=errback)
```

With this correction, the function now checks if the 'url' parameter is None or an empty string, and raises a ValueError in those cases. This ensures that the function handles these edge cases appropriately.
