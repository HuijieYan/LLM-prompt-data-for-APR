The potential error in the function `follow` is in the line `url = self.urljoin(url)`. The `urljoin` function is attempting to perform a URL join operation without being defined, which will result in a `NameError` when the function `follow` is called.

The reason behind the occurrence of this bug is that the `urljoin` function is not defined within the scope of the `follow` function, and therefore it cannot be called in this way.

To fix this bug, the `urljoin` function needs to be properly defined within the same class or scope as the `follow` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `follow` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
           cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
           dont_filter=False, errback=None):
    # type: (...) -> Request
    """
    Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
    It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
    but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
    not only an absolute URL.
    
    :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow` 
    method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
    and Link objects.
    """
    if isinstance(url, Link):
        url = url.url
    url = urljoin(self.url, url)
    return Request(url, callback,
                   method=method,
                   headers=headers,
                   body=body,
                   cookies=cookies,
                   meta=meta,
                   encoding=encoding,
                   priority=priority,
                   dont_filter=dont_filter,
                   errback=errback)
```

In this corrected code, the `urljoin` function is imported from `urllib.parse` and used to join the base URL with the provided URL. This fixes the bug and ensures that the `urljoin` function is properly defined and called within the `follow` function.
