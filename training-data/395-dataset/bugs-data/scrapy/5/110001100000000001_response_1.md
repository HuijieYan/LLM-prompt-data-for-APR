Potential error location: The error may be occurring in the line `url = self.urljoin(url)`, where the `urljoin` function is being called as an instance method of the class.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `urljoin` function is being called as an instance method, but it is not defined as an instance method within the same class. This leads to a `NameError` as the function is not recognized as a method of the class.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define the `urljoin` function as a method within the class to make it accessible as an instance method.
2. Pass an instance of the class to the `urljoin` function as a parameter when calling it.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

class Response:
    # ... other methods ...

    def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
               cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
               dont_filter=False, errback=None):
        """
        Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
        It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
        but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
        not only an absolute URL.
        
        :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow` 
        method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
        and Link objects.
        """
        if isinstance(url, Link):
            url = url.url
        url = urljoin(self.url, url)
        return Request(url, callback,
                       method=method,
                       headers=headers,
                       body=body,
                       cookies=cookies,
                       meta=meta,
                       encoding=encoding,
                       priority=priority,
                       dont_filter=dont_filter,
                       errback=errback)
```

In the corrected code, the `urljoin` function is accessed using the `urljoin` from `urllib.parse` module, and it is called with `self.url` as the base URL to join the relative `url`. This ensures that the correct `urljoin` function is utilized and the bug is fixed.
