Potential error location:
The error likely occurs within the urljoin method, as it is not correctly called and may not be functioning as intended.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The url parameter is not being properly processed, and the urljoin method is not being utilized correctly to process the given URL.

Suggested approach for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the urljoin method is called correctly to process the given URL.
2. Check for any potential issues with the Link object and its processing within the function.
3. Make sure that the function handles cases where the URL is empty or None, and raises an exception in such cases.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from scrapy.http.request import Request
from scrapy.link import Link

def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
           cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
           dont_filter=False, errback=None):
    if not url:
        raise ValueError("Invalid URL")

    if isinstance(url, Link):
        url = url.url

    # Ensure that urljoin method is correctly called
    url = self.urljoin(url)

    return Request(url, callback,
                   method=method,
                   headers=headers,
                   body=body,
                   cookies=cookies,
                   meta=meta,
                   encoding=encoding,
                   priority=priority,
                   dont_filter=dont_filter,
                   errback=errback)
```
