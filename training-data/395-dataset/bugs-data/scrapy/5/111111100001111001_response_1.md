The bug in the provided function is that it is calling the `urljoin` method as if it were an instance method, but it is actually a class method. This is evident from the fact that `self.urljoin` is being called directly without passing any arguments in the `follow` method.

To fix this bug, we should call `urljoin` as a class method by using `Response.urljoin(url)` instead of `self.urljoin(url)`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
           cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
           dont_filter=False, errback=None):
    # type: (...) -> Request
    """
    Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
    It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
    but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
    not only an absolute URL.
    
    :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow` 
    method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
    and Link objects.
    """
    if isinstance(url, Link):
        url = url.url
    url = Response.urljoin(url)
    return Request(url, callback,
                   method=method,
                   headers=headers,
                   body=body,
                   cookies=cookies,
                   meta=meta,
                   encoding=encoding,
                   priority=priority,
                   dont_filter=dont_filter,
                   errback=errback)
```

By making this change, the `urljoin` method will be called correctly as a class method, and the bug will be fixed.
