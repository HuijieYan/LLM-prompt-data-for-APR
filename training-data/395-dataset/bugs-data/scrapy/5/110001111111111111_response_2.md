The error message from the test function "test_follow_None_url" indicates that the ValueError is not raised by the follow function when called with None as the url parameter.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the url parameter. Currently, the function does not handle the case where the url parameter is None or an empty string.

The bug occurs because the follow function does not validate the input for the url parameter. As a result, when None is passed as the url parameter, it does not raise a ValueError as expected in the test, but instead proceeds with processing the None value.

To fix the bug, the follow function should include a check for None or empty string for the url parameter and raise a ValueError in those cases. This will make the function behavior more explicit and prevent unexpected behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the follow function:

```python
def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
           cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
           dont_filter=False, errback=None):
    if url is None or url == '':
        raise ValueError("Invalid URL")

    if isinstance(url, Link):
        url = url.url
    url = self.urljoin(url)
    return Request(url, callback,
                   method=method,
                   headers=headers,
                   body=body,
                   cookies=cookies,
                   meta=meta,
                   encoding=encoding,
                   priority=priority,
                   dont_filter=dont_filter,
                   errback=errback)
```

With this change, the follow function will now raise a ValueError when called with None or an empty string as the url parameter, satisfying the expected behavior of the test case.
