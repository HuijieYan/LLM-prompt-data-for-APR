The error occurs when trying to call the `url_for` method for a route that has a host specified in the Sanic blueprint. Instead of returning the correct URL with the specified hostname, the method returns an incorrect URL.

The potential error location within the `url_for` function is when handling routes with a specified host, as it seems to incorrectly concatenate the host and path.

The bug occurs because the function does not correctly account for routes with specified hosts. When the view name is passed to `url_for`, it doesn't appropriately handle routes with a specified host and their association with the provided view name.

To fix the bug, the function should check if the route being requested has a specified host and build the URL accordingly. If the route has a specified host, the function should construct the URL with the provided hostname and path. If the route does not have a specified host, the URL should be built with just the path.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_for` function:

```python
from sanic.router import RouteExists, RouteDoesntExist, BlueprintRoute

def url_for(self, view_name: str, **kwargs):
    # existing code...

    # find the route by the supplied view name
    kw: Dict[str, str] = {}
    if view_name == "static":
        kw.update(name=kwargs.pop("name", "static"))
    elif view_name.endswith(".static"):  # blueprint.static
        kwargs.pop("name", None)
        kw.update(name=view_name)

    try:
        uri, route, blueprint = self.router._get_host_or_url(
            view_name, host=kwargs.get('_external_host')
        )
    except RouteDoesntExist:
        raise URLBuildError(
            f"Endpoint with name '{view_name}' was not found"
        )

    if blueprint and not isinstance(route, BlueprintRoute):
        uri, route = self.router._find_static_file_uri(
            uri, route, kw, kwargs
        )

    # existing code...
```

In the corrected code, we handle the case of specified hosts by calling `self.router._get_host_or_url` to get the appropriate URI, route, and blueprint. If a specified host exists for the route, it constructs the URL with the provided hostname and path, ensuring that the correct URL is generated.

By implementing this change, the `url_for` function should now correctly generate URLs for routes with specified hosts.
