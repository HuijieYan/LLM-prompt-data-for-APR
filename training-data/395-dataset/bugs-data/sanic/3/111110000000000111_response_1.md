The error seems to be related to the generation of URLs using the `url_for` function in Sanic when using blueprints with the host argument. The expected behavior is not being met, and incorrect URLs are being generated.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely around the logic that handles the host and the route when building the URL.

One possible reason for the bug is that the `url_for` function may not be properly handling the host argument when constructing the URL, leading to the incorrect URLs being generated.

To fix the bug, the `url_for` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the host argument when constructing URLs for blueprints.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic `url_for` function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name: str, _external=False, **kwargs):
    route = self.router.get(self.name, view_name)
    if not route:
        raise URLBuildError(
            "Endpoint with name `{}` was not found".format(view_name)
        )

    netloc = ''
    if _external:
        netloc = self.config.get("HOST", "")  # Use blueprint's host as default
    else:
        netloc = ''  # Use empty netloc for internal URLs

    uri = route.uri
    for contract in route.contracts:
        name = contract.name.strip("<>")
        if name in kwargs:
            uri = uri.replace("<{}>".format(name), str(kwargs[name]))
            del kwargs[name]

    query_string = urlencode(kwargs, doseq=True) if kwargs else ""
    scheme = 'http' if not _external else 'https'
    url = urlunparse((scheme, netloc, uri, '', query_string, ''))
    
    return url
```

The corrected `url_for` function now properly handles the `_external` argument, uses the blueprint's host as the default value for `netloc`, and constructs the URL using the `urlunparse` function.
