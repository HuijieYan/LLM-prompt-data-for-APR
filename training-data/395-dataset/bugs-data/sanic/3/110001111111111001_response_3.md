Based on the error message from the test function, it seems that the `app.url_for("hostindex")` call is returning `'example.com'` instead of `'/'.` This indicates that there is an issue with the `url_for` function when handling the `host` parameter.

The potential error location could be within the conditional blocks that handle the special cases for static files and the `host` parameter. Specifically, the issue might be related to how the `uri` is being assigned in these conditional blocks and the subsequent processing of the `uri`.

The bug occurs because when the `host` parameter is defined in the route decorator (e.g., `@app.route("/", name="hostindex", host="example.com")`), the `uri` is being incorrectly set as the value of the `host` parameter. This leads to the incorrect behavior when building the URL.

To fix the bug, the `uri` should be extracted from the route definition without including the `host` parameter. This ensures that the correct `uri` is used when building the URL.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_for` function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name: str, **kwargs):
    # ... (previous code) ...

    # find the route by the supplied view name
    kw: Dict[str, str] = {}
    # special static files url_for
    if view_name == "static":
        kw.update(name=kwargs.pop("name", "static"))
    elif view_name.endswith(".static"):  # blueprint.static
        kwargs.pop("name", None)
        kw.update(name=view_name)

    uri, route = self.router.find_route_by_view_name(view_name, **kw)
    if not (uri and route):
        raise URLBuildError(
            "Endpoint with name `{}` was not found".format(view_name)
        )

    # handle cases where host is defined in the route
    if "<host:" in uri:
        for key, value in kwargs.items():
            uri = uri.replace(f"<{key}>", value)

    # handle cases where filename is defined in the route
    if "<file_uri:" in uri:
        filename = kwargs.pop("filename", None)
        if filename:
            uri = f"{uri}/{filename}"

    # handle slashes
    if uri != "/" and uri.endswith("/"):
        uri = uri[:-1]

    # construct the URL
    out = uri
    query_string = urlencode(kwargs, doseq=True) if kwargs else ""
    out = urlunparse(("", "", out, "", query_string, ""))

    return out
```

In the corrected code, additional handling has been added to properly extract the `uri` from the route definition and construct the URL based on the provided `view_name` and `kwargs`. Additionally, unnecessary variables and conditional blocks have been removed for clarity.
