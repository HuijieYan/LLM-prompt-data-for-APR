The bug occurs in the `url_for` method of the `app` object. When trying to get the URL for a route with a host specified, the function incorrectly constructs the URL, using the host as a path instead of a hostname. This results in incorrect URLs being returned.

The `url_for` function should construct the URL based on the specified view name and the values provided in the keyword arguments. However, in the current implementation, there are issues with handling the host and external URL construction.

To fix the bug, the `url_for` function should be modified to properly handle the host and construct the external URLs with the correct hostname.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_for` function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name: str, **kwargs):
    # ... (existing code) ...

    netloc = kwargs.pop("_server", None)
    if netloc is None and external:
        netloc = self.config.get("SERVER_NAME", "")
    
    if netloc:
        if not external:
            scheme = "http"  # Default to HTTP if not specified
        else:
            scheme = kwargs.pop("_scheme", "http")  # Use the specified scheme or default to HTTP
        
        # Reconstruct the URL with the correct scheme and hostname
        uri = urljoin(f"{scheme}://{netloc}", uri)

    # ... (existing code) ...

    # Construct the full URL with path, query string, and anchor
    out = urlunparse((scheme, netloc, uri, "", query_string, anchor))

    return out
```

The changes made include properly handling the `netloc` (hostname with optional port) and constructing the URL based on the specified scheme, netloc, and other components. This should fix the bug and ensure that the `url_for` function returns the correct URLs, including the hostname when the host is specified.
