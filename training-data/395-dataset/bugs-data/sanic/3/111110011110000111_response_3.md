The error occurs when using the `url_for` function to generate URLs for routes with a host argument, specifically when using a blueprint. The function is not properly handling the host argument, resulting in incorrect URLs being generated.

The potential error location is likely within the `url_for` function, where it processes the host argument and constructs the URL.

The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle the host argument when generating the URL. This leads to the incorrect URLs being produced, as observed in the test results and the associated detailed issue description.

To fix the bug, the `url_for` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the host argument when constructing the URL. This may involve checking for the presence of the host argument and properly incorporating it into the generated URL.

Below is the corrected code for the `url_for` function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name: str, _external=False, **kwargs):
    # ... existing code ...

    netloc = kwargs.pop("_server", None)
    if netloc is None and (external or _external):
        netloc = self.config.get("SERVER_NAME", "")

    if external or _external: 
        scheme = self.config.get("PREFERRED_URL_SCHEME", "http")

        if "://" not in netloc:
            netloc = f"{scheme}://{netloc}"

    # ... rest of the code ...

    out = urlunparse((scheme, netloc, out, "", query_string, anchor))

    return out
```

In the corrected code, the handling of the `_external` argument is improved to properly create the fully qualified domain name with the full path when generating the URL. This should address the issue with blueprint routes and the host argument.
