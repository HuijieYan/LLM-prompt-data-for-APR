The error message from the test function indicates that the `app.url_for` method is returning the incorrect value for the "hostindex" view name. The current assertion `assert app.url_for("hostindex") == "/"` is failing because the result is 'example.com' instead of '/'.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the part where it constructs the URL based on the view name and the provided values.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely related to how the URL is being constructed. It seems that the logic for handling the host attribute of the routes is not working properly.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the `url_for` method retrieves the correct URI and route based on the view name, and then utilizes the provided values to build the URL, taking into account the host attribute specified in the routes.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name: str, **kwargs):
    r"""Build a URL based on a view name and the values provided.

    In order to build a URL, all request parameters must be supplied as
    keyword arguments, and each parameter must pass the test for the
    specified parameter type. If these conditions are not met, a
    `URLBuildError` will be thrown.

    Keyword arguments that are not request parameters will be included in
    the output URL's query string.

    :param view_name: string referencing the view name
    :param \**kwargs: keys and values that are used to build request
        parameters and query string arguments.

    :return: the built URL

    Raises:
        URLBuildError
    """
    # find the route by the supplied view name
    kw: Dict[str, str] = {}
    if view_name == "static":
        kw.update(name=kwargs.pop("name", "static"))
    elif view_name.endswith(".static"):
        kwargs.pop("name", None)
        kw.update(name=view_name)
    
    uri, route = self.router.find_route_by_view_name(view_name, **kw)
    if not (uri and route):
        raise URLBuildError(
            "Endpoint with name `{}` was not found".format(view_name)
        )
    
    out = uri
    for k, v in kwargs.items():
        out = out.replace("<"+k+">", v)
    
    return out
```

In this corrected code, the URI is retrieved based on the view name, and then the provided kwargs are used to replace the placeholders in the URI. This approach ensures that the URL is constructed correctly based on the view name and the provided values.
