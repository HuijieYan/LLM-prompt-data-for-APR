The test case and error message provided indicate that when using blueprints with the host argument and trying to get a URL with `url_for`, an incorrect URL is returned. The blueprint's host is used as a path, not as a hostname.

The potential error location within the `url_for` function is likely related to how the host argument is being handled when building the URL.

The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle the host argument when building the URL. It results in the blueprint's host being used as a path, rather than as a hostname.

To fix the bug, the `url_for` function needs to properly handle the host argument and ensure that it is used as the correct hostname in the generated URL.

Below is the corrected code for the `url_for` function:

```python
# corrected url_for function
def url_for(self, view_name: str, _external=False, **kwargs):
    r"""Build a URL based on a view name and the values provided.

    In order to build a URL, all request parameters must be supplied as
    keyword arguments, and each parameter must pass the test for the
    specified parameter type. If these conditions are not met, a
    `URLBuildError` will be thrown.

    Keyword arguments that are not request parameters will be included in
    the output URL's query string.

    :param view_name: string referencing the view name
    :param _external: whether to include the full domain in the URL
    :param \**kwargs: keys and values that are used to build request
        parameters and query string arguments.

    :return: the built URL

    Raises:
        URLBuildError
