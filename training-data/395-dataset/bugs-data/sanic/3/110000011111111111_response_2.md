The issue seems to be with the `url_for` function. In the test case `test_routes_with_host`, the URL generated for the "hostindex" route is incorrect. The expected URL should be "/" instead of "example.com".

The error might be occurring in the section where the host names are being handled. It seems the function is incorrectly handling the host and route parameters to generate the URL.

The bug could be occurring because the function is not properly handling the host parameter when generating the URL. It incorrectly includes the host as part of the path rather than using it as a hostname.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly handle the host parameter to generate the URL. It needs to consider the host as the hostname and only include the path when needed.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_for` function:

```python
from typing import Dict
import re
from urllib.parse import urlencode, urlunparse

class URLBuildError(Exception):
    pass

def url_for(self, view_name: str, **kwargs) -> str:
    # Existing code ...

    uri, route = self.router.find_route_by_view_name(view_name, **kw)
    if not (uri and route):
        raise URLBuildError(
            "Endpoint with name `{}` was not found".format(view_name)
        )

    # Check if the view_name is a host route
    if route.host:
        uri = route.host  # Set the URI to the host if host is specified in the route

    # Continue with the existing logic to handle other parameters and generate the URL

    # Rest of the existing code ...

    return out
```

In the corrected code, the `url_for` function checks if the route has a host specified. If it does, the function sets the URI to the host, and the rest of the logic continues to handle other parameters and generate the URL accordingly. This should fix the bug and generate the correct URLs for routes with host parameters.
