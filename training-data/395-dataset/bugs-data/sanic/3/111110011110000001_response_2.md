The error is occurring in the `assert app.url_for("hostindex") == "/"` line of the test function. The expected value is "/", but the actual value is "example.com". This indicates that the `url_for` method is not returning the expected URL when called with the "hostindex" view name.

The potential error location within the `url_for` method is the section that handles the host parameter. It seems that the host parameter is not being properly handled when constructing the URL.

The bug occurs because the `url_for` method is not properly handling the host parameter, which is causing the incorrect URL to be generated.

To fix the bug, the `url_for` method should properly handle the host parameter when constructing the URL. This involves checking if the host parameter is present and using it to build the correct URL with the proper host.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_for` method:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name: str, _external=False, **kwargs):
        # ... (existing code) ...

        netloc = kwargs.pop("_server", None)
        if netloc is None and external:
            netloc = self.config.get("SERVER_NAME", "")
        
        if netloc:  # Add this condition to handle the host parameter
            netloc = "{}://{}".format(scheme, netloc)
        else:
            netloc = "//{}".format(netloc)

        # ... (existing code) ...

        out = urlunparse((scheme, netloc, out, "", query_string, anchor))

        return out
```

In the corrected code, the netloc is properly constructed by combining the scheme and netloc (host) parameters. This ensures that the host parameter is handled correctly when constructing the URL.
