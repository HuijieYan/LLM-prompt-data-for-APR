The error occurs when the `app.url_for("hostindex")` is called within the test function. The expected value is `"/"` but the actual returned value is `"example.com"`.

The bug is likely located in the conditional block that checks if `view_name` ends with ".static". There is a case where the URI is being updated to the `view_name` value, which is incorrect.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that when `view_name` is "hostindex" or "hostpath", it matches the condition for the URI to be updated to the `view_name` value, which is "example.com" and "path.example.com" respectively. This is not the expected behavior.

A possible approach to fixing the bug would be to remove the part of the code that updates the URI in this specific condition. Instead, the URI should maintain its original value.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def url_for(self, view_name: str, **kwargs):
    # ... (existing code)

    uri, route = self.router.find_route_by_view_name(view_name, **kw)

    # ... (existing code)

    # remove the part where uri is being updated to view_name
    if view_name == "static" or view_name.endswith(".static"):
        # update other relevant parts if necessary
        filename = kwargs.pop("filename", None)
        # it's static folder
        if "<file_uri:" in uri:
            folder_ = uri.split("<file_uri:", 1)[0]
            if folder_.endswith("/"):
                folder_ = folder_[:-1]

            if filename.startswith("/"):
                filename = filename[1:]

            uri = "{}/{}".format(folder_, filename)

    # ... (existing code)

    return out
```
