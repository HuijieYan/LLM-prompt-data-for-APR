The potential error location within the problematic function is around the code that handles the construction of the URL based on the `view_name` and the `kwargs`. The issue seems to be related to how the `host` argument for the blueprint is handled when constructing the URL.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code does not properly handle the `host` argument for blueprints when constructing the URL using the `url_for` method. As a result, the host argument is not being used as expected, leading to incorrect URLs being generated.

To fix the bug, the code should be modified to properly handle the `host` argument for blueprints when constructing the URL using the `url_for` method. Specifically, the `host` argument for blueprints should be used to generate the correct hostname when constructing the URL.

The corrected code for the problematic function `url_for` is as follows:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name: str, _external: bool = False, _server: str = None, **kwargs):
    """
    Build a URL based on a view name and the values provided.
    
    In order to build a URL, all request parameters must be supplied as
    keyword arguments, and each parameter must pass the test for the
    specified parameter type. If these conditions are not met, a
    `URLBuildError` will be thrown.
    
    Keyword arguments that are not request parameters will be included in
    the output URL's query string.
    
    :param view_name: string referencing the view name
    :param _external: bool indicating whether the URL should be absolute or not
    :param _server: the hostname to use, defaults to None
    :param \**kwargs: keys and values that are used to build request
        parameters and query string arguments.
    
    :return: the built URL
    
    Raises:
        URLBuildError
    """

    netloc = kwargs.pop("_server", None)
    if netloc is None and external:
        netloc = self.config.get("SERVER_NAME", "")
    elif netloc is None and host:
        netloc = host

    # ... existing code ...
