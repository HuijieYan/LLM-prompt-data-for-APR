Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the handling of the host argument in the url_for() function, specifically with blueprint routes.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the url_for() function does not correctly handle the host argument for blueprint routes. It results in incorrect URLs being generated, with the blueprint's host being used as a path instead of a hostname.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the url_for() function to correctly handle the host argument for blueprint routes.
2. Check the logic for building the URL and ensure that the host argument is appropriately included in the generated URL.
3. Update the conditional logic within the function to handle blueprint routes with the host argument more accurately.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name: str, _external=False, _server=None, _scheme=''):
    r"""Build a URL based on a view name and the values provided.

    In order to build a URL, all request parameters must be supplied as
    keyword arguments, and each parameter must pass the test for the
    specified parameter type. If these conditions are not met, a
    `URLBuildError` will be thrown.

    Keyword arguments that are not request parameters will be included in
    the output URL's query string.

    :param view_name: string referencing the view name
    :param \**kwargs: keys and values that are used to build request
        parameters and query string arguments.
    :param _external: if True, return an absolute URL (optional)
    :param _server: override the configured server name (optional)
    :param _scheme: the URL scheme for external URLs (optional)

    :return: the built URL

    Raises:
        URLBuildError
    """
    # ... (other existing logic)

    if view_name == "static":
        kw.update(name=kwargs.pop("name", "static"))
    elif view_name.endswith(".static"):  # blueprint.static
        kwargs.pop("name", None)
        kw.update(name=view_name)

    uri, route = self.router.find_route_by_view_name(view_name, **kw)
    if not (uri and route):
        raise URLBuildError(
            "Endpoint with name `{}` was not found".format(view_name)
        )

    # Handle blueprint host argument
    if route.blueprint and route.blueprint.host:
        netloc = route.blueprint.host
    elif _server and _external:
        netloc = _server
    elif _external:
        netloc = self.config.get("SERVER_NAME", "")
    else:
        netloc = ''

    # Handle the generation of the URL based on the host argument
    if _external:
        if not _scheme:
            _scheme = 'http'  # default to http if no scheme is specified

        out = urlunparse((scheme, netloc, uri, "", "", anchor))
    else:
        out = uri

    # ... (rest of the existing logic)

    return out
```

The corrected code includes modifications to handle the host argument for blueprint routes and generate the URL accordingly. The use of _external, _server, and _scheme parameters has been integrated to provide flexibility in generating absolute URLs.
