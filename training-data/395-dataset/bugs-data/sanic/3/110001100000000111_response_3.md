The issue seems to be related to the `url_for` function in the provided code. When using blueprints with the `host` argument and trying to get a URL with `url_for`, the URL returned is incorrect. Instead of using the blueprint's host as the hostname, it is being used as a path.

Upon reviewing the code, the potential error location is around the logic where the URI is constructed using the `route` method and the `host` parameter.

The reason for this bug is that the `url_for` function does not handle the `host` argument correctly when building the URL for routes with blueprints. It should take into account the `host` and construct the URL accordingly.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to update the `url_for` function to correctly handle the `host` argument when constructing the URL. This involves modifying the logic around constructing the URL to incorporate the `host` parameter for blueprints.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_for` function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name: str, **kwargs):
    # existing code ...

    uri, route = self.router.find_route_by_view_name(view_name, **kw)
    if not (uri and route):
        raise URLBuildError(
            "Endpoint with name `{}` was not found".format(view_name)
        )

    if route.blueprint:
        host = route.blueprint.get("host")
        if host and kwargs.pop("_external", False):
            scheme = kwargs.pop("_scheme", "http")
            netloc = host
        else:
            netloc = self.config.get("SERVER_NAME", "")

    # existing code ...
    # construct the URL using the updated netloc
    out = urlunparse((scheme, netloc, out, "", query_string, anchor))

    return out
```

In this corrected code, we added a condition to check if the route has a blueprint and extract the `host` from it. If the `host` is present and the URL is requested to be external, it uses the `scheme` and `netloc` to construct the URL with the correct hostname.
