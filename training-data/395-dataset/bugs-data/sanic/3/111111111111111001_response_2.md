The error message indicates that the `app.url_for("hostindex")` call returned "example.com" instead of the expected "/". This suggests that the URI for the "hostindex" route is being incorrectly processed by the `url_for` function.

The potential error location within the `url_for` function is likely within the logic for handling routes with a specified host.

The bug occurs because the logic for handling routes with a specified host does not correctly build the URI when generating the URL. This results in the incorrect URI being returned when calling `url_for` for routes with a specified host.

To fix the bug, the `url_for` function should properly handle routes with a specified host and build the URI based on the host configuration.

Here is the corrected `url_for` function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name: str, **kwargs):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # find the route by the supplied view name
    kw: Dict[str, str] = {}
    if view_name == "static":
        kw.update(name=kwargs.pop("name", "static"))
    elif view_name.endswith(".static"):
        kwargs.pop("name", None)
        kw.update(name=view_name)

    # Find the route based on the view name and host
    uri, route = self.router.find_route_by_view_name(view_name, host=kwargs.pop("_server", None), **kw)
    
    # Process the URI and build the URL based on the route information
    # ... omitted code ...

    return out
```
