The error occurs because when calling `app.url_for("hostindex")`, the expected output is `"/"` but the actual output is `"example.com"`. This discrepancy suggests that the `url_for` function is not generating the correct URL for the given view name.

The potential error location within the `url_for` function could be the section where it checks for the view name and constructs the URI. It seems that for view names with a specified host, the function may not be handling the URI construction correctly.

One possible reason for this bug could be that the function is not handling the host attribute properly when constructing the URL. It might be ignoring the host information or handling it incorrectly, leading to the wrong URL being formed.

To fix the bug, the `url_for` function needs to correctly handle the host attribute when constructing the URL for a given view name. It should incorporate the specified host into the generated URL.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_for` function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name: str, **kwargs):
    # ... existing code ...

    uri, route = self.router.find_route_by_view_name(view_name, **kw)
    if not (uri and route):
        raise URLBuildError(
            "Endpoint with name `{}` was not found".format(view_name)
        )

    # construct the URL using the specified host
    if route.host is not None:
        netloc = route.host
    # ... existing code ...

    # use the route's URI for constructing the URL
    out = uri

    # ... remaining code ...
```

In the corrected code, we ensure that the route's host is properly used in constructing the URL when it is specified. This should handle the discrepancy and ensure that the correct URL is generated for the given view name, including the specified host.
