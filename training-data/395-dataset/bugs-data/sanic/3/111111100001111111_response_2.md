The bug occurs in the `url_for` function of the `Sanic` class where it fails to properly construct URLs for blueprint routes with a host.

Upon analysis of the bug, it seems that the issue lies within the logic for handling the host argument in the `url_for` function. The function is unable to properly handle the blueprint's host and ends up using it as a path, resulting in incorrect URLs.

To fix this bug, the `url_for` function needs to be modified to properly handle blueprint routes with a host. The logic for constructing the URL should consider the blueprint's host and use it as the hostname in the URL.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_for` function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name: str, **kwargs):
    # existing code...
    
    uri, route = self.router.find_route_by_view_name(view_name, **kw)
    if not (uri and route):
        raise URLBuildError(
            "Endpoint with name `{}` was not found".format(view_name)
        )

    out = uri

    # Modify the logic to properly handle blueprint routes with a host
    if "." in view_name:
        host, path = view_name.split(".", 1)
        uri = f"{host}/{path}"

    # Ensure the uri does not end with a slash
    if uri != "/" and uri.endswith("/"):
        uri = uri[:-1]

    # existing code...

    return out
```

In the corrected code, the logic for handling the blueprint's host is modified to correctly construct the URI. This change should address the bug and ensure that the `url_for` function returns the expected URLs for blueprint routes with a host.
