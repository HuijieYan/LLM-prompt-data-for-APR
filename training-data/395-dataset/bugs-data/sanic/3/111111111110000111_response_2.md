Based on the error message from the test function and the detailed issue description, it seems that the `url_for` function is not correctly handling the host parameter when generating URLs for routes with different hosts.

The issue is likely occurring within the `url_for` function when dealing with routes that have a specified host.

To fix this bug, the `url_for` function should correctly handle the `host` attribute of routes when generating URLs. It should use the specified host as the hostname in the generated URL if the route has a host attribute specified.

Here's a corrected version of the `url_for` function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name: str, **kwargs):
    # ... omitted code ...

    uri, route = self.router.find_route_by_view_name(view_name, **kw)
    if not (uri and route):
        raise URLBuildError(
            "Endpoint with name `{}` was not found".format(view_name)
        )
    
    if route.host:
        hostname = route.host  # Use the specified host as the hostname
    else:
        hostname = netloc

    # rest of the code remains unchanged

    # scheme://netloc/path;parameters?query#fragment
    out = urlunparse((scheme, hostname, out, "", query_string, anchor))

    return out
```

In this corrected code, we check if the route has a specified host (`route.host`), and if so, we use it as the hostname in the generated URL. Otherwise, we fall back to the `netloc`.

This modification should ensure that the `url_for` function correctly handles the host parameter when generating URLs for routes with different hosts, addressing the bug reported in the issue.
