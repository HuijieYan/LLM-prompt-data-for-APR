Potential Error Location: The issue seems to be related to the `url_for` method in the Sanic framework. When using blueprints with the host argument, the `url_for` method does not correctly handle the hostname and path, resulting in incorrect URLs being generated.

Reasons for the Bug: The bug seems to be related to how the `url_for` method handles the host argument in the presence of blueprints. It appears that the method is not properly utilizing the blueprint's host as a hostname, leading to incorrect URL generation.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: To fix this bug, the `url_for` method should be modified to correctly handle the host argument when used with blueprints. Additionally, the logic for building URLs should be reviewed and adjusted to ensure that the correct hostname and path are included in the generated URLs.

Corrected Code:
```python
def url_for(self, view_name: str, **kwargs):
    # ... existing code ...

    uri, route = self.router.find_route_by_view_name(view_name, **kw)
    if not (uri and route):
        raise URLBuildError(
            "Endpoint with name `{}` was not found".format(view_name)
        )

    # Modify the logic to correctly handle the hostname and path
    if view_name == "static" or view_name.endswith(".static"):
        filename = kwargs.pop("filename", None)
        if filename and uri.startswith("/<"):
            uri += "/" + filename

    out = uri

    # ... existing code ...

    # Correct the logic for building URLs
    # Use the host argument from the blueprint
    netloc = route.host or netloc

    # ... existing code ...

    # build the URL using the corrected parameters
    out = urlunparse((scheme, netloc, out, "", query_string, anchor))

    return out
```

In the corrected code, the `url_for` method has been modified to handle the host argument correctly when used with blueprints. The logic for building URLs has been adjusted to ensure that the correct hostname and path are included in the generated URLs. Additionally, the `netloc` variable is modified to use the host argument from the blueprint, ensuring that the correct hostname is used in the generated URLs.
