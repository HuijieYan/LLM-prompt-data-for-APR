Potential error location: It seems that the function is trying to build a URL based on a view name and the values provided, but there are several conditional checks and operations which might lead to unexpected behavior.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The code contains multiple conditional checks and operations, such as handling static files and building URL parameters, which may lead to unexpected or incorrect URL construction.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Simplify the logic of the function, separate concerns, and handle each part of the URL construction separately to ensure correctness.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name: str, **kwargs):
    r"""Build a URL based on a view name and the values provided.

    In order to build a URL, all request parameters must be supplied as
    keyword arguments, and each parameter must pass the test for the
    specified parameter type. If these conditions are not met, a
    `URLBuildError` will be thrown.

    Keyword arguments that are not request parameters will be included in
    the output URL's query string.

    :param view_name: string referencing the view name
    :param \**kwargs: keys and values that are used to build request
        parameters and query string arguments.

    :return: the built URL

    Raises:
        URLBuildError
    """
    route = self.find_route_by_view_name(view_name)
    if not route:
        raise URLBuildError("Endpoint with name `{}` was not found".format(view_name))

    out = route.build(**kwargs)

    return out
```
