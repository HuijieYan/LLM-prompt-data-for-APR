Potential Error Location:
The error seems to be occurring in the `url_for` method of the Sanic class. This method is responsible for building a URL based on a view name and the values provided.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect handling of the host argument when building the URL in the `url_for` method. It appears that the method is not properly incorporating the host parameter into the output URL, leading to incorrect URLs being generated.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. It may be necessary to modify how the host parameter is handled within the `url_for` method to ensure that it is correctly included in the output URL.
2. Additionally, the method may need to account for whether the URL being built is internal or external, and adjust the output accordingly.

Corrected Function for the `url_for` Method:
```python
from sanic.exceptions import URLBuildError
from urllib.parse import urlencode, urlunparse
import re
from typing import Dict

class Sanic():
    # ... omitted code ...

    # existing methods...

    def url_for(self, view_name: str, **kwargs):
        r"""Build a URL based on a view name and the values provided.
        
        ... (rest of the docstring)

        :return: the built URL

        Raises:
            URLBuildError
        """
        # ... (existing code)

        anchor = kwargs.pop("_anchor", "")
        external = kwargs.pop("_external", False)

        uri, route = self.router.find_route_by_view_name(view_name, **kwargs)
        if not (uri and route):
            raise URLBuildError(
                "Endpoint with name `{}` was not found".format(view_name)
            )

        out = uri

        # handling the host for internal and external URLs
        if not external:
            host = None
        else:
            host = route.get("host")

        # construct output URL based on host and path
        if host:
            if not host.startswith("http"):  # make sure it's a valid URL
                host = "http://" + host
            uri = urlunparse((host, "", uri, "", "", ""))
            out = uri

        # find all the parameters we will need to build in the URL
        matched_params = re.findall(self.router.parameter_pattern, uri)

        # ... (existing code)

        # construct the remainder of the keyword arguments into a querystring
        query_string = urlencode(kwargs, doseq=True) if kwargs else ""
        out = urlunparse(("", "", out, "", query_string, anchor))

        return out
```
In the corrected code, the `url_for` method has been updated to properly handle the host parameter and appropriately construct the output URL. It now takes into account whether the URL is internal or external and adjusts the output based on the host and path. Additionally, the code has been refactored to improve readability and include necessary error handling.
