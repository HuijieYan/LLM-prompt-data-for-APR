The potential error location within the problematic function is in the part where it's trying to replace the parameter in the URL with the supplied value. The bug occurs because the replacement of parameters in the URL is not handled properly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the portion of the code that replaces the parameter in the URL with the supplied value. We also need to handle the query string construction more robustly.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_for` method:

```python
from typing import Dict
import re
from urllib.parse import urlencode, urlunparse
from werkzeug.routing import BuildError

def url_for(self, view_name: str, **kwargs):
    r"""Build a URL based on a view name and the values provided.

    In order to build a URL, all request parameters must be supplied as
    keyword arguments, and each parameter must pass the test for the
    specified parameter type. If these conditions are not met, a
    `BuildError` will be thrown.

    Keyword arguments that are not request parameters will be included in
    the output URL's query string.

    :param view_name: string referencing the view name
    :param \**kwargs: keys and values that are used to build request
        parameters and query string arguments.

    :return: the built URL

    Raises:
        BuildError
    """
    try:
        uri, route = self.router.find_route_by_view_name(view_name)
    except BuildError as e:
        raise BuildError(f"Endpoint with name `{view_name}` was not found") from e

    for kwarg in kwargs:
        if kwarg not in route.arguments:
            raise BuildError(f"Parameter '{kwarg}' is not in the list of valid parameters for '{view_name}'")

    try:
        out = uri
        query_params = {}
        for arg, value in kwargs.items():
            if arg in route.arguments:
                out = out.replace(f"<{arg}>", str(value))
            else:
                query_params[arg] = value
        query_string = urlencode(query_params)
        if query_string:
            out = f"{out}?{query_string}"

        return out
    except Exception as e:
        raise BuildError("Failed to build URL") from e
```
