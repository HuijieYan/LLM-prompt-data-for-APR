The error message from the test function states that the `url_for` function is returning `'example.com'` instead of `'/'` for the view name `'hostindex'`. This indicates that there is a bug in the `url_for` function.

The bug is likely in the logic for building the URL based on the view name and the values provided. The function is not correctly handling the case where the route has a host specified.

The reason behind the bug is that the function does not properly handle routes with host specified, resulting in incorrect URLs being built.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to correctly handle routes with host specified. This might involve parsing the host and including it in the built URL when necessary.

Below is the corrected code for the `url_for` function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name: str, **kwargs):
    # ... (previous code)

    # find the route by the supplied view name
    kw: Dict[str, str] = {}
    # special static files url_for
    if view_name == "static":
        kw.update(name=kwargs.pop("name", "static"))
    elif view_name.endswith(".static"):  # blueprint.static
        kwargs.pop("name", None)
        kw.update(name=view_name)

    # Retrieve the route by the view name and host
    uri, route = self.router.find_route_by_view_name(view_name, **kw)
    if not (uri and route):
        raise URLBuildError("Endpoint with name `{}` was not found".format(view_name))

    # If the route has the host specified, use it in the built URL
    if route.host is not None:
        uri = route.host + uri
    
    # ... (remaining code)
```

With this correction, the `url_for` function now properly handles routes with host specified, and it should return the expected URLs for the given test cases.
