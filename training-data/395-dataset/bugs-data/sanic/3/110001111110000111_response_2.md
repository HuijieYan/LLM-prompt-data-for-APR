The issue is occurring because the `url_for` function is not handling the blueprint routes and their hosts correctly, resulting in incorrect URLs being generated.

The potential error location within the `url_for` function is in the logic where it handles building the URL for blueprint routes with hosts.

To fix the bug, the `url_for` function needs to be modified to correctly handle blueprint routes with hosts. This can be achieved by checking the route's host and using it to construct the correct URL.

Here's the correct code for the `url_for` function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name: str, **kwargs):
    r"""Build a URL based on a view name and the values provided.

    In order to build a URL, all request parameters must be supplied as
    keyword arguments, and each parameter must pass the test for the
    specified parameter type. If these conditions are not met, a
    `URLBuildError` will be thrown.

    Keyword arguments that are not request parameters will be included in
    the output URL's query string.

    :param view_name: string referencing the view name
    :param \**kwargs: keys and values that are used to build request
        parameters and query string arguments.

    :return: the built URL

    Raises:
        URLBuildError
    """
    # ... (existing code)

    # get the route for the view name
    route = self.router.get(view_name)
    if not route:
        raise URLBuildError(
            "Route with name `{}` was not found".format(view_name)
        )

    # handle blueprint routes with hosts
    host = route.host or ""
    if host and "." in host:  # host is a domain, not just a path
        uri = f"{route.host}{uri}"  # prepend the host to the URL

    # ... (existing code)

    return urlunparse((scheme, netloc, out, "", query_string, anchor))
```

In this corrected code, after getting the route for the view name, the function checks if the route has a host. If it does, and the host contains ".", indicating it is a domain, it prepends the host to the URL. This allows the function to correctly handle blueprint routes with hosts while building the URL.
