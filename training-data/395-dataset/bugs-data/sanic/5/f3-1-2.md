Describe the bug
Logger did not work at current master commit (7d79a86).

Code snippet

from sanic import Sanic
from sanic.log import logger
from sanic.response import text


app = Sanic()

@app.listener('before_server_start')
async def setup(app, loop):
    logger.info('INFO')


@app.get('/')
async def test(request):
    return text('hello world')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run()
There is no any log/output now.

Expected behavior
At 0.8.3 release, it will logging/output some messages like:

[2018-11-05 17:34:47 +0800] [12112] [INFO] Goin' Fast @ http://127.0.0.1:8000
[2018-11-05 17:34:47 +0800] [12112] [INFO] INFO
[2018-11-05 17:34:47 +0800] [12112] [INFO] Starting worker [12112]
Environment (please complete the following information):

OS: Ubuntu 18.04
Version: 7d79a86
Additional context
It seems that getLogger() does not get the correct logger at line 56 in log.py. The logger is trying to get a logger named sanic.root, but it does not exist. Rename the logger root at line 9 should fix this bug.
```
