The error occurs in the `url_for` method of the `Request` class. It seems that the method is trying to access the `SERVER_NAME` from the app's configuration, which is not available, leading to a `KeyError`. This is causing the method to return `None`, which results in a `TypeError` when trying to access `response.json["url"]` in the test function.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `url_for` method to handle the case where `SERVER_NAME` is not available in the app's configuration. We can use the `host` and `port` attributes of the request object to generate the URL instead.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_for` method:

```python
class Request():
    """
    Properties of an HTTP request such as URL, headers, etc.
    """

    # ... other methods ...

    def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
        """
        Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
        `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
        to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

        :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
        :return: an absolute url to the given view
        :rtype: str
        """
        scheme = self.scheme
        host = self.host
        port = self.server_port

        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

        return self.app.url_for(
            view_name, _external=True, _server=netloc, _scheme=scheme, **kwargs
        )
```

With this change, the `url_for` method should generate the correct URL even if `SERVER_NAME` is not available in the app's configuration. This should resolve the `KeyError` and the subsequent `TypeError` in the test function.
