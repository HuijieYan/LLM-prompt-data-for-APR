The error in the `url_for` function is likely due to the way it tries to access the `SERVER_NAME` configuration from the `app` object, which is not defined within the function. Additionally, there are some logical issues in determining the `netloc` based on the `scheme` and `server_port` values.

The buggy function incorrectly attempts to access `SERVER_NAME` directly from the `app` object, but it should actually be accessed using the `self` object. The logic for determining the `netloc` also needs to be revised to handle both `http` and `https` schemes correctly.

To fix the bug, you can use the `self` object to access the `SERVER_NAME` configuration. Additionally, the logic for determining the `netloc` based on the scheme and port should be simplified.

Below is the corrected code for the `url_for` function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.server_name
    port = self.server_port
    
    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)
    
    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

In the corrected code, we access the `scheme`, `server_name`, and `server_port` using the `self` object, and then determine the `netloc` based on the scheme and port. We then call the `url_for` function on the `app` object with the correct parameters.
