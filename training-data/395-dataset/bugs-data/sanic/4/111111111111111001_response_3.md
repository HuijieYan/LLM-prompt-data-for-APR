The error occurs because the `url_for` function does not return any value, leading to a `NoneType` object that cannot be subscripted when trying to access the `json` attribute.

The issue is with the `url_for` function within the `Request` class. This function is being overridden within the class, and the original implementation is being replaced. This mismatch is causing the error.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the overridden `url_for` function within the `Request` class and fix the signature of the function to match the expected behavior. Additionally, we should make sure that the `url_for` function correctly returns the expected value.

Here's the corrected code for the `Request` class with the fixed `url_for` function:

```python
class Request():
    """
    Properties of an HTTP request such as URL, headers, etc.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def scheme(self):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def server_name(self):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def server_port(self):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def host(self):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
        """
        Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
        `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
        to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

        :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
        :return: an absolute url to the given view
        :rtype: str
        """
        # Determine the scheme and netloc based on the request
        scheme = self.scheme
        host = self.server_name
        port = self.server_port

        if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
            scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
        ):
            netloc = host
        else:
            netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

        # Construct the absolute URL
        absolute_url = f"{scheme}://{netloc}/{view_name}"

        return absolute_url
```

In this corrected function, we have removed the redundant code and ensured that the `url_for` function returns the absolute URL as expected. This should resolve the issue with the test case and the error message.
