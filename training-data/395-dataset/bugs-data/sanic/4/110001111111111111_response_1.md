The error is occurring because the `url_for` method is trying to access the SERVER_NAME property from the app.config attribute of the `self.app` object. However, the SERVER_NAME property is not available in the app.config attribute, leading to a KeyError and causing the method to return None.

To fix this issue, the `url_for` method needs to be modified so that it can determine the scheme, host, and port without relying on the SERVER_NAME property in the app.config attribute.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_for` method:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.host
    port = self.server_port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `url_for` method directly uses the `self.host` attribute to determine the host, instead of accessing the SERVER_NAME property in the app.config attribute. This ensures that the method can determine the correct scheme, host, and port without relying on the SERVER_NAME property.

By making this change, the `url_for` method should no longer throw a KeyError and return the correct absolute URL.
