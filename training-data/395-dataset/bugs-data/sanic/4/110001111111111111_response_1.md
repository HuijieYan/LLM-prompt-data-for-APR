The error occurs in the `url_for` function because it attempts to access the `SERVER_NAME` attribute from the `app.config` object, which is not present and hence raises a KeyError. This results in the function not returning the correct URL and causing the test to fail.

To fix this bug, the `url_for` function needs to be modified so that it can generate a full URL with the given path without relying on the `SERVER_NAME` configuration.

Here's the corrected `url_for` function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.host
    port = self.port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

In this corrected code, the `server_name` attribute has been replaced with `host`, and the `server_port` attribute has been replaced with `port` to reflect the correct attributes used for generating the URL. Additionally, there is no longer any need to access the `SERVER_NAME` configuration from `app.config`, so this eliminates the potential for a KeyError.
