The error message indicates that there is a KeyError with the 'SERVER_NAME' attribute in the `url_for` method of the `Request` class. This suggests that the 'SERVER_NAME' attribute is missing in the `self.app.config` dictionary, causing the KeyError when the `url_for` method tries to access it.

The bug occurs in the definition of the `url_for` method within the `Request` class. The method assumes that the 'SERVER_NAME' attribute is present in the `self.app.config` dictionary, but it is not handling the case where the attribute is missing, leading to the KeyError.

To fix the bug, the `url_for` method needs to be modified to handle the situation where the 'SERVER_NAME' attribute is not present in the `self.app.config` dictionary. This can be done by checking if the 'SERVER_NAME' attribute exists before accessing it, and if it doesn't exist, using an alternative approach to determine the netloc.

Additionally, the method documentation should clarify the requirement for the 'SERVER_NAME' attribute and provide guidance on how to configure it.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_for` method:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """

    # Full URL SERVER_NAME can only be handled in app.url_for
    if hasattr(self.app.config, 'SERVER_NAME') and "//" in self.app.config.SERVER_NAME:
        return self.app.url_for(view_name, _external=True, **kwargs)

    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.server_name
    port = self.server_port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

In this corrected code, we first check if the 'SERVER_NAME' attribute exists in the `self.app.config` dictionary using `hasattr`. If it exists, the method behaves as before. If it doesn't exist, it falls back to determining the netloc using the `scheme`, `server_name`, and `server_port` attributes of the `Request` object. This change will handle the KeyError when the 'SERVER_NAME' attribute is not present.
