The error message indicates a `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable` on line 2118 of the test function, which suggests that `response.json` is returning `None`. This could be due to an error in the `url_for` method, causing it to return `None` instead of the expected URL.

The error occurs when the `url_for` method is called with the view_name "url_for" within the sample route. This method is expected to generate a URL, but it fails to do so, resulting in `response.json["url"]` being `None`.

Upon reviewing the `url_for` method, it is apparent that the bug lies in the condition checking for the presence of "//" in `self.app.config.SERVER_NAME`. If this condition is not met, the method tries to access `self.scheme`, `self.server_name`, and `self.server_port`, which might not be properly set. This could lead to the method returning `None` instead of a valid URL.

To fix the bug, the method should be modified to ensure that it always returns a valid URL for the given view. The logic for determining the `scheme` and `netloc` should be revised to consider different scenarios and handle them properly.

Here's the corrected `url_for` method:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.server_name
    port = self.server_port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

This corrected method ensures that the `scheme` and `netloc` are properly determined and used to generate the absolute URL for the given view. This should resolve the issue and prevent the `None` return value, fixing the bug encountered in the test function.
