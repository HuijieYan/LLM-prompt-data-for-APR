The error message indicates a 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable, which means that the response.json["url"] is None and cannot be accessed like a dictionary. This implies that the url_for function is not returning the expected output.

The potential error location within the url_for function is with the calculation of the netloc based on the scheme and port. It seems to be calculating the netloc incorrectly.

The bug is likely occurring because the netloc is not being calculated correctly based on the scheme and port, leading to the incorrect generation of the absolute URL.

To fix the bug, we can modify the calculation of the netloc within the url_for function to ensure it reflects the correct scheme and port, and then generate the absolute URL accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the url_for function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.server_name
    port = self.server_port

    netloc = host

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port != 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port != 443
    ):
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

This corrected function ensures that the netloc is calculated based on the scheme and port correctly and then generates the absolute URL accordingly.
