The issue seems to be with accessing the `SERVER_NAME` attribute from the `app.config` in the `url_for` function of the `Request` class. The error message indicates that the `SERVER_NAME` is not found in the configuration.

The bug occurs because the code assumes that `app.config.SERVER_NAME` is always available, but in some cases, it may not be defined. This can lead to a `KeyError` when trying to access `SERVER_NAME` from `app.config`.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `SERVER_NAME` is not defined in the configuration. One approach could be to provide a default value for `SERVER_NAME` if it's not found in the configuration, or to handle the absence of `SERVER_NAME` gracefully.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_for` function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    # Full URL SERVER_NAME can only be handled in app.url_for
    if hasattr(self.app.config, 'SERVER_NAME') and "//" in self.app.config.SERVER_NAME:
        return self.app.url_for(view_name, _external=True, **kwargs)

    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.server_name
    port = self.server_port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

In the corrected code, we first check if `SERVER_NAME` is available in the configuration using `hasattr`. If it's available, we proceed with using it as before. If it's not available, the code handles the `netloc` differently to generate the absolute URL without needing `SERVER_NAME`. This approach ensures that the function is more robust and gracefully handles the absence of `SERVER_NAME`.
