Error Analysis:
The url_for method is trying to construct a full URL based on the request, but it is encountering an error with the server_name and server_port values. The code attempts to check if the scheme is "http" or "https" and if the port is 80 or 443, and then construct the netloc accordingly. However, it is not taking into account the actual server name and port from the request object.

Bug Location:
The bug is most likely occurring in the calculation of the netloc variable, where the actual server name and port are not being used to construct the full URL.

Reasons for the Bug:
The code is trying to get the scheme, server name, and port from the request object but is not using the correct attributes to retrieve these values. Additionally, it is unnecessarily checking for special port numbers for "http" and "https" schemes when these should be taken directly from the request.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use the correct attributes of the request object to get the scheme, server name, and port.
2. Remove unnecessary checks for special port numbers based on the scheme.
3. Construct the netloc using the actual server name and port from the request.

Corrected Code:
```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    # Get scheme, server name, and port from the request object
    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.request.host
    port = self.request.port

    netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```
