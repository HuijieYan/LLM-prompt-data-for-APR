Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the `url_for` method of the Request class. The code is trying to handle the `SERVER_NAME` property of the `app` object, which is not defined within the method. 

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: 
1. The `app` object is not defined within the method, causing the code to reference an attribute that does not exist.
2. The logic for determining the `netloc` based on the scheme and port is incorrect.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Pass the `app` object as a parameter to the `url_for` method, so that it can access the `SERVER_NAME` property.
2. Correct the logic for determining the `netloc` based on the scheme and port.

Corrected code:

```python
def url_for(self, app, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param app: Sanic application instance
    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    # Full URL SERVER_NAME can only be handled in app.url_for
    if "//" in app.config.SERVER_NAME:
        return app.url_for(view_name, _external=True, **kwargs)

    scheme = self.scheme()
    host = self.server_name()
    port = self.server_port()

    if (scheme.lower() in ["http", "ws"] and port == 80) or (scheme.lower() in ["https", "wss"] and port == 443):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return app.url_for(view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs)
```
