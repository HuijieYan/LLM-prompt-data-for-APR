The test_url_for_without_server_name function is testing the behavior of the url_for method. It expects the generated URL to be "http://127.0.0.1:{app.test_client.port}/url-for", but it's encountering a TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable.

The issue seems to be within the url_for method. It appears that the method is not returning a valid value, resulting in a 'NoneType' object being accessed as if it were subscriptable.

The reason behind the bug could be that the logic for determining the netloc and constructing the URL in the url_for method is not functioning as intended, resulting in a None return value. This could be due to incorrect handling of the scheme, host, and port values.

To fix the bug, the logic for determining the netloc and constructing the URL needs to be revised to ensure that valid values are returned. Additionally, the handling of scheme, host, and port should be reviewed to verify that the correct values are being used in forming the URL.

A possible approach for fixing the bug in the url_for method would be to update the logic for determining the netloc and constructing the URL based on the scheme, host, and port values. This may involve checking the values of these attributes and adjusting the construction of the netloc and URL accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the url_for method:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.host
    port = self.port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

In the corrected code, the scheme, host, and port attributes are used directly to determine the netloc, and the URL is constructed accordingly. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the url_for method returns a valid URL.
