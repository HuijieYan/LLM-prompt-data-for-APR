The bug in the provided code is that it is trying to access the 'SERVER_NAME' attribute directly from the app configuration without checking if it exists. This will lead to a KeyError if the 'SERVER_NAME' attribute is not present in the app configuration.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the buggy function to handle the case where the 'SERVER_NAME' attribute may not exist in the app configuration.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param view_name: the name of the view function
    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    # Full URL SERVER_NAME can only be handled in app.url_for
    if "SERVER_NAME" in self.app.config and "//" in self.app.config.SERVER_NAME:
        return self.app.url_for(view_name, _external=True, **kwargs)

    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.server_name
    port = self.server_port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the 'SERVER_NAME' attribute exists in the app configuration before accessing it. If it exists, we use it to generate the absolute URL using `self.app.url_for`. Otherwise, we proceed to generate the URL based on the scheme, host, and port of the request.

This fix ensures that the 'SERVER_NAME' attribute is only accessed if it exists, preventing the KeyError.
