The error occurs in the `url_for` method of the `Request` class in the provided code. The error message indicates a KeyError for 'SERVER_NAME', which implies that the `SERVER_NAME` attribute is not found in the configuration of the request.

The reason for this error is that the `url_for` method tries to access the `SERVER_NAME` attribute from the app's configuration, but it's not available. This could be due to changes in the Sanic framework, which now requires the `SERVER_NAME` to be configured explicitly.

To fix the bug, the `url_for` method needs to be modified to handle cases where `SERVER_NAME` is not available in the configuration. It should use the host and port information directly from the request to generate the URL.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_for` method:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` based on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.server_name
    port = self.server_port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

In this corrected code, the `SERVER_NAME` attribute has been removed, and the host and port information is directly obtained from the request object. This avoids the need for the `SERVER_NAME` attribute in the configuration.
