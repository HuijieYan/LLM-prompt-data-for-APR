The error message indicates a "TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable" when trying to access response.json["url"]. This suggests that the request.url_for method is returning None instead of the expected URL string.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the implementation of the url_for method. The method is trying to access self.app.config.SERVER_NAME, which may not be set, leading to the KeyError and the method returning None.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the url_for method is trying to access the SERVER_NAME configuration directly, which may not be set. This causes the method to return None instead of the expected URL string, leading to the TypeError in the test case.

To fix the bug, the url_for method should be modified to handle the case where SERVER_NAME is not set. It can use the existing properties like scheme, server_name, and server_port to build the URL without relying on the SERVER_NAME configuration.

Here's the corrected code for the url_for method:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.server_name
    port = self.server_port

    netloc = host
    if port and port not in (80, 443):
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

In this corrected code, the url_for method no longer tries to access self.app.config.SERVER_NAME. Instead, it directly uses the scheme, server_name, and server_port properties of the request object to build the URL. If the port is not 80 or 443, it includes the port in the netloc. This ensures that the url_for method can generate the correct URL without relying on the SERVER_NAME configuration.
