The bug is occurring in the `url_for` method of the `Request` class. The error message indicates that `self.app.config.SERVER_NAME` is not found, causing a `KeyError`. This error indicates that the `SERVER_NAME` attribute is not defined in the `config` attribute of the app.

The bug occurs because the `url_for` method tries to access the `SERVER_NAME` from the `config` attribute, which is not present, leading to a `KeyError`.

To fix this bug, the code in the `url_for` method needs to be modified to handle the absence of the `SERVER_NAME` attribute. Instead of relying on `self.app.config.SERVER_NAME`, the method should be modified to get the host and port from the request itself. This can be done using `self.server_name` and `self.port`.

Here's the corrected code for the method:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.server_name
    port = self.server_port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

In this corrected code, `self.server_name` and `self.server_port` are used to determine the host and port, ensuring that the `SERVER_NAME` from the config is not required. This should resolve the `KeyError` issue when calling `request.url_for()` and generate the correct URL based on the request attributes.
