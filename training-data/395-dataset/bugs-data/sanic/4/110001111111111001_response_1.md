The error occurs because the `url_for` method in the `Request` class is returning `None` instead of the expected URL. This is likely due to the incorrect logic in the `url_for` method provided.

The bug is likely occurring in the conditional statement `if "//" in self.app.config.SERVER_NAME`, as it is checking if "//" is present in the `SERVER_NAME` config. This condition may not be accurate for determining if the URL is an absolute URL.

To fix the bug, the logic for determining the scheme, host, port, and netloc should be adjusted. Additionally, the `url_for` method should be constructed correctly using the determined scheme and netloc.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_for` method:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.host
    port = self.server_port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

In this corrected method, the `host` attribute is used instead of the `server_name` attribute to get the hostname. The scheme, host, port, and netloc are determined based on the request attributes, and then the `url_for` method is called appropriately using these values. This should fix the bug and ensure that the `url_for` method returns the correct URL.
