The error occurs in the `url_for` function of the `Request` class. It seems that the function is trying to access a `SERVER_NAME` property from the app's configuration, but it is not found, leading to a KeyError.

The issue is likely caused by the code trying to access `self.app.config.SERVER_NAME`, but the `SERVER_NAME` property might not exist in the app's configuration. This could be a result of a change in the Sanic version, as indicated in the GitHub issue report.

To fix the bug, the code should check if the `SERVER_NAME` property exists in the app's configuration before trying to access it, and handle the case when it's not present. Since the bug might be related to changes in Sanic version 19.9.0, it's important to ensure that the code is compatible with the new version.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_for` function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    if "SERVER_NAME" in self.app.config:
        server_name = self.app.config.SERVER_NAME
    else:
        server_name = "localhost"

    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.server_name
    port = self.server_port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

In this corrected code, it first checks if `SERVER_NAME` exists in the app's configuration. If it does, it uses that as the `server_name`; if not, it defaults to "localhost". This should prevent the KeyError when trying to access the `SERVER_NAME` property.
