The error message indicates that the "response.json" is of type 'NoneType', which means that the request.url_for("url_for") is returning None instead of the expected URL. 

The issue is likely within the "url_for" method itself. It appears that the code to generate the netloc is not correct, leading to the incorrect URL being generated.

The bug occurs due to the incorrect generation of the netloc based on the scheme and port. The function should correctly determine the netloc based on the provided scheme, server name, and port.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly determine the netloc based on the scheme and port. Additionally, it should handle the case where the scheme is not specified.

Here's the corrected code for the "url_for" function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    if self.server_name.startswith("http") or self.server_name.startswith("ws"):
        scheme_netloc = self.server_name
    else:
        port = ""
        if self.server_port not in [80, 443]:
            port = ":%s" % self.server_port
        scheme_netloc = "%s://%s%s" % (self.scheme, self.server_name, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=self.scheme, _server=scheme_netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

This corrected function should correctly determine the netloc based on the provided scheme, server name, and port, and generate the expected absolute URL.
