The error message `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable` suggests that the value being accessed as `response.json` is `None`. This indicates that the `url_for` function within the `Request` class is not returning a valid value.

The potential error location within the `url_for` function is likely in the conditional block that checks for "//" in `self.app.config.SERVER_NAME`. If this condition is not met, the function should still return a valid value for the URL but it seems to fail in doing so.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely related to the conditional block that handles the logic for constructing the `netloc` variable. If the condition for "//" in `self.app.config.SERVER_NAME` is not met, the subsequent logic for constructing `scheme`, `host`, `port`, and `netloc` might not be correct.

To fix the bug, the `netloc` variable should be constructed correctly by accommodating different scenarios for scheme, host, and port. Additionally, the function should handle the case where the condition for "//" in `self.app.config.SERVER_NAME` is not met.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_for` function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
        """
        Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
        `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
        to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.
    
        :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
        :return: an absolute url to the given view
        :rtype: str
        """
        scheme = self.scheme
        host = self.server_name
        port = self.server_port
    
        if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port in (80, None)) or (
            scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port in (443, None)
        ):
            netloc = host
        else:
            netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

        return self.app.url_for(
            view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
        )
```

In the corrected code, we have removed the conditional block checking for "//" in `self.app.config.SERVER_NAME` and directly proceeded to construct the `scheme`, `host`, `port`, and `netloc` variables based on the request properties. The logic for constructing `netloc` has been modified to handle different scenarios for scheme and port values. This should ensure that the function returns a valid URL for the given view.
