The error message indicates a TypeError for 'NoneType' object being not subscriptable. This suggests that the response.json object is of type None, which means that the request.url_for method did not return the expected value.

The issue lies in the buggy function, especially in the url_for method of the Request class. The method is attempting to access self.app.config.SERVER_NAME, which is causing the KeyError as 'SERVER_NAME' is not found in the config attribute.

The bug occurred because the buggy url_for method is trying to access the SERVER_NAME attribute from the config, which may not be set. This can happen if the server is running behind a proxy, as indicated in the GitHub issue description.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the url_for method to handle the case where SERVER_NAME is not set in the config. We can use the host and port information available within the request object to construct the netloc instead. This will ensure that the method can generate the correct URL irrespective of the SERVER_NAME configuration.

Here's the corrected code for the url_for method:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.server_name
    port = self.server_port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

With this modification, the url_for method will construct the netloc using the available host and port information, ensuring that the generated URL is correct even if the SERVER_NAME is not set in the configuration.
