The error message from the test function indicates that there is an issue with accessing the "url" from the response.json, as it is throwing a TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable.

Upon analyzing the provided code, it is evident that the buggy function 'url_for' in the Request class is the root cause of the issue. The 'url_for' function is trying to access the SERVER_NAME from the app.config, which is causing the KeyError.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the 'url_for' function is attempting to access the SERVER_NAME from the app.config, but this variable is not defined, leading to the KeyError. This is causing the 'url_for' function to return None instead of the expected URL.

To fix the bug, the 'url_for' function should be modified to handle the scenario where the SERVER_NAME is not defined. It should utilize the request's attributes like scheme, server_name, and server_port to construct the URL. Additionally, it should also consider whether the app is running behind a proxy and adjust the URL generation accordingly.

Here is the corrected 'url_for' function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.server_name
    port = self.server_port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    url = self.app.url_for(view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs)
    return url
```

In the corrected function, the code to check for "//" in self.app.config.SERVER_NAME and defining netloc based on it has been removed. Instead, the URL is constructed using the scheme, server_name, and server_port directly from the request.

This updated code will address the KeyError issue and provide the expected absolute URL when calling the 'url_for' function.
