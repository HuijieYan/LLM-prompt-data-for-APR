The error occurs in the `url_for` method of the `Request` class. The error is likely caused by the usage of `self.app.config.SERVER_NAME` in the method, which is expected to hold the server name but is not present in the configuration.

To fix the bug, the `url_for` method should be updated to use the server name from the request context instead of the configuration. This can be achieved by accessing the server name directly from the request object.

Here is the corrected `url_for` method:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.server_name
    port = self.server_port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

In this corrected version, we directly use `self.scheme`, `self.server_name`, and `self.server_port` to determine the `scheme` and `netloc` for the URL. This approach is more suitable as it uses the request context values rather than relying on the server name from the configuration, which may not always be present.

This fix ensures that the `url_for` method works as expected even without the `SERVER_NAME` being present in the server's configuration.
