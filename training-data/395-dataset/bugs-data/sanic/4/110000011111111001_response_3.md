The error occurs because the `url_for` function is returning `None` instead of the expected URL. This is likely due to an issue in the logic of the function.

The bug might be located at the `if "//" in self.app.config.SERVER_NAME:` condition of the url_for function. When this condition is not met, the function tries to create the absolute URL but uses `_scheme` and `_server` instead of `_external` as arguments.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic of the function to ensure that it always returns a valid URL.

Here's the corrected code for the url_for function:

```python
# corrected function
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.server_name
    port = self.server_port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

This corrected code removes the condition and sets _external=True to ensure that the function always returns a valid URL.
