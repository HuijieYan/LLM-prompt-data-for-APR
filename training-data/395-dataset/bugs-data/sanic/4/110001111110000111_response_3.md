The error message from the test function indicates a `TypeError` with a 'NoneType' object. This suggests that the `url_for` method is not returning a valid value, potentially `None`, which leads to the subsequent error.

Upon further inspection, the issue seems to be related to the access of the `SERVER_NAME` configuration variable within the `url_for` method. The `if "//" in self.app.config.SERVER_NAME` statement implies that the `SERVER_NAME` is expected to be present in the config. However, the error message from the GitHub issue suggests that this requirement is causing issues, especially when running Sanic behind a proxy.

To fix this bug, the `url_for` method should be revised to handle cases where the `SERVER_NAME` may not be available in the configuration. This could involve using a default value or a conditional check to ensure that the method does not raise a `KeyError` when accessing the `SERVER_NAME` configuration variable.

Below is the corrected code for the `url_for` method:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    # Full URL SERVER_NAME can only be handled in app.url_for
    server_name = self.app.config.get('SERVER_NAME')  # Get the SERVER_NAME from config
    return self.app.url_for(view_name, _external=True, _server=server_name, **kwargs)  # Use the retrieved server_name
```

In this corrected code, the `get` method is used to retrieve the `SERVER_NAME` configuration value from the app's configuration. If the `SERVER_NAME` is not present, it will default to `None`. This ensures the method does not raise a `KeyError` when accessing the `SERVER_NAME` configuration variable and allows the method to function without requiring the `SERVER_NAME` to be explicitly set.
