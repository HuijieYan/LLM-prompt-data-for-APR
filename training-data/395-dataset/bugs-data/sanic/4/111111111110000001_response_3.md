The error message indicates a 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable, which means that the response's 'json' attribute is None. This suggests that the 'url_for' method in the Request class is not returning the expected value, resulting in a None value being assigned to the 'url' key in the response JSON.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the 'url_for' method, specifically in the conditional statement where it checks for the presence of "//" in the SERVER_NAME. If "//" is not present, it tries to construct the URL using the provided parameters, but it may not be handling the parameters correctly.

The bug occurs because the conditional statement to check for the presence of "//" in SERVER_NAME does not accurately determine the URL structure. This leads to incorrect construction of the URL in the subsequent code.

To fix the bug, the 'url_for' method needs to be modified to accurately determine the URL structure and construct the URL accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the 'url_for' method:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.server_name
    port = self.server_port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = f"{host}:{port}"

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

In the corrected code, the 'url_for' method no longer checks for the presence of "//" in SERVER_NAME, as it is not a reliable method to determine the URL structure. Instead, it directly determines the scheme, host, and port based on the request and constructs the URL with the correct structure. This should resolve the issue with the NoneType error and ensure that the URL is constructed properly.
