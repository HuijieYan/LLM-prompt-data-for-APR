The bug is occurring in the `url_for` method of the Sanic web framework. The error message indicates that the `SERVER_NAME` is not being found in the app's configuration, leading to a `KeyError`. This is happening in Sanic version 19.9.0 when trying to generate a URL using `request.url_for`.

The bug is likely occurring in the `url_for` method where it is attempting to access the `SERVER_NAME` from the app's configuration. However, it seems that `SERVER_NAME` is not present in the configuration, leading to the `KeyError`.

To fix this bug, the `url_for` method needs to be modified to handle cases where `SERVER_NAME` is not present in the app's configuration. It should provide a default behavior to handle this situation.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_for` method:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.server_name
    port = self.server_port

    if "//" in (host or ""):
        return self.app.url_for(view_name, _external=True, **kwargs)
    else:
        if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
            scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
        ):
            netloc = host
        else:
            netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

        return self.app.url_for(
            view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
        )
```

In this fixed function:

1. We removed the check for `SERVER_NAME` in the app configuration as it was leading to the `KeyError`.
2. We directly used `self.server_name` to access the server name without relying on the app configuration.
3. We added a default case for when the `SERVER_NAME` is not present, and instead used `self.server_name` and `self.server_port` to construct the `netloc` for the URL.

This should fix the bug and allow the `url_for` method to work correctly even when `SERVER_NAME` is not present in the app's configuration.
