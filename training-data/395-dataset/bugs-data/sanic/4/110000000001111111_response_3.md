The error occurs in the function url_for when it tries to access the SERVER_NAME attribute from the app's config. This attribute is not defined, leading to a KeyError being raised.

The reason behind this bug is that the function is assuming that the SERVER_NAME attribute will be available in the app's config. However, in the current version of Sanic (19.9.0), this attribute is not present by default, which causes the function to fail.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to handle the case where the SERVER_NAME attribute is not present in the app's config. We can use the request object to access the host and port instead, and then use that information to construct the netloc.

Here's the corrected code for the url_for function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.request.host.split(":")[0]  # Extract the host from the request
    port = self.request.host.split(":")[1] if ":" in self.request.host else 80  # Extract the port from the request

    if scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80:
        netloc = host
    elif scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443:
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs)
```

In the corrected code, we are accessing the host and port directly from the request object instead of relying on the SERVER_NAME attribute. This ensures that the function will work regardless of whether the SERVER_NAME attribute is present in the config or not.
