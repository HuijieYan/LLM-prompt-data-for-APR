The error seems to be related to the 'NoneType' object not being subscriptable, which means that the response object does not contain the 'json' attribute, likely because the 'url_for' function is not returning the expected absolute URL.

The potential error location within the 'url_for' function is the conditional statement `if "//" in self.app.config.SERVER_NAME`, which is used to determine whether to generate the URL with the full SERVER_NAME. This condition may not be evaluating as expected, leading to the incorrect URL generation.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be that the conditional statement is not properly handling the SERVER_NAME to determine if the URL should be generated with the full SERVER_NAME.

To fix the bug, the condition for handling the full SERVER_NAME should be revised to properly evaluate the SERVER_NAME configuration and generate the correct absolute URL.

Here's the corrected code for the 'url_for' function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.server_name
    port = self.server_port

    if self.app.config.get("SERVER_NAME"):
        netloc = self.app.config.SERVER_NAME
    else:
        if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
            scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
        ):
            netloc = host
        else:
            netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

In the corrected code, the condition has been revised to check if the SERVER_NAME configuration is present using `self.app.config.get("SERVER_NAME")`. If it is present, the netloc is set to the SERVER_NAME, otherwise, it follows the previous logic to determine the netloc based on the scheme and port. This should generate the correct absolute URL and fix the bug.
