The error message indicates that the 'response.json["url"]' is a NoneType object and cannot be subscripted. This suggests that the 'url_for' function is not returning the expected value, leading to the NoneType error.

The potential error location lies in the 'url_for' method of the 'Request' class. The 'url_for' method is attempting to access the 'SERVER_NAME' property from the configuration, but it seems that the 'SERVER_NAME' property is not present in the configuration, leading to a KeyError.

The bug occurs because the 'url_for' method is expecting the 'SERVER_NAME' property to be present in the configuration, but it is not handling the scenario where the property is not set. This causes the method to raise a KeyError when trying to access the non-existent property.

To fix this bug, the 'url_for' method needs to check if the 'SERVER_NAME' property is present in the configuration before accessing it. If the property is not set, the method should handle this scenario gracefully and generate the URL based on other available information like scheme, host, and port.

Here's the corrected 'url_for' method:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    # Full URL SERVER_NAME can only be handled in app.url_for
    if "SERVER_NAME" in self.app.config and "//" in self.app.config.SERVER_NAME:
        return self.app.url_for(view_name, _external=True, **kwargs)

    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.server_name
    port = self.server_port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

In the corrected method, we added a check to see if "SERVER_NAME" is in the app configuration before trying to access it. If it's not present, the method will still be able to generate the URL based on the scheme, host, and port, thus preventing the KeyError from occurring.
