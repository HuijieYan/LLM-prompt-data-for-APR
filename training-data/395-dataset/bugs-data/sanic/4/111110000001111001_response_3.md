The error seems to be occurring in the `url_for` method of the `Request` class. The function is attempting to generate an absolute URL based on the scheme, server name, and port. However, the condition for checking the presence of "//" in `self.app.config.SERVER_NAME` seems to be incorrect as it is attempting to access the `config` attribute of the `app` object. Additionally, the variable names `_scheme` and `_server` are used in the `app.url_for` method call, but they are not defined anywhere in the function.

To fix the bug, we can update the condition to check if "//" is present in `self.server_name` instead of `self.app.config.SERVER_NAME`. Additionally, we should use the correct parameters `_scheme` and `_server` when calling the `app.url_for` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_for` function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
        """
        Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
        `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
        to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

        :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
        :return: an absolute url to the given view
        :rtype: str
        """
        scheme = self.scheme
        host = self.server_name
        port = self.server_port

        if "//" in self.server_name:
            netloc = host
        else:
            netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

        return self.app.url_for(
            view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
        )
```
