        scheme = self.scheme()
        host = self.host()
        port = self.port()

        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

        return self.app.url_for(
            view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs

```

The corrected function now retrieves the `scheme`, `host`, and `port` using the respective methods and generates the `netloc` based on these values.
