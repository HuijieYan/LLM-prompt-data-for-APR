The potential error in the code is that the function `url_for` is trying to access the properties `app`, `scheme`, `server_name`, and `server_port` which are not defined within the function. These properties are likely meant to be accessed from the request object, but this is not clear from the given code.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code is trying to access properties that are not defined within the scope of the function. Additionally, the logic for determining the `netloc` based on the scheme and port is not clearly implemented.

To fix the bug, the code should access the properties `self.app`, `self.scheme`, `self.server_name`, and `self.server_port` correctly from the request object. Additionally, the logic for determining the `netloc` based on the scheme and port needs to be implemented accurately.

Here is the corrected code for the `url_for` function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    # Determine scheme based on request
    scheme = self.request.scheme

    # Determine netloc based on request
    host = self.request.host
    port = self.request.port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

In the corrected code, the properties `self.request.scheme`, `self.request.host`, and `self.request.port` are accessed to determine the scheme and netloc. This ensures that the function retrieves the necessary information from the request object. The logic for determining the netloc based on the scheme and port has also been implemented accurately.
