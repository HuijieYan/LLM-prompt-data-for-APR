The error message indicates a `TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable`, which means that the response.json is resulting in a NoneType object, indicating that the url_for function is not returning the expected result.

The potential error location within the function is the calculation of the netloc. It seems that the netloc is not being calculated correctly, which is causing the url_for function to return an unexpected result.

The function is trying to determine the scheme, host, port, and netloc for the URL based on the request. However, the calculation for netloc seems to be incorrect, leading to an incorrect URL being returned.

To fix the bug, the netloc calculation should be revised to ensure that it correctly represents the scheme, host, and port for the URL.

Here's the corrected code for the url_for function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    if "//" in self.app.config.SERVER_NAME:
        return self.app.url_for(view_name, _external=True, **kwargs)

    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.server_name
    port = self.server_port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return f"{scheme}://{netloc}{self.app.url_for(view_name, **kwargs)}"
```

In the corrected code, the netloc is calculated using the scheme, host, and port, and then the absolute URL is constructed by combining the scheme, netloc, and the URL obtained from self.app.url_for.
