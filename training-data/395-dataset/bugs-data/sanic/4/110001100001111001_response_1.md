The potential error in the provided function is in the calculation of the `netloc` variable. The `netloc` variable is used to determine the network location part of the URL, including the host and port.

The bug occurs because the condition for determining the `netloc` is incorrect. It checks if the scheme is "http" or "ws" and the port is 80, or if the scheme is "https" or "wss" and the port is 443. However, this condition does not cover all possible combinations of scheme and port, leading to incorrect calculations of the `netloc`.

To fix the bug, we can modify the condition for determining the `netloc` based on the scheme and port. We can also replace the incorrect "_server" parameter with "_server" in the `url_for` method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    # Full URL SERVER_NAME can only be handled in app.url_for
    if "//" in self.app.config.SERVER_NAME:
        return self.app.url_for(view_name, _external=True, **kwargs)

    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.server_name
    port = self.server_port

    if (scheme.lower() == "http" and port == 80) or (scheme.lower() == "ws" and port == 42101) or (scheme.lower() == "https" and port == 443) or (scheme.lower() == "wss" and port == 42101):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

With this correction, the condition for determining the `netloc` is updated to cover all the possible combinations of scheme and port, and the "_server" parameter in the `url_for` method is correctly replaced with "_server".
