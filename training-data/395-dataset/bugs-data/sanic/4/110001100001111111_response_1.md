The error occurs in the function `url_for` of the Request class. The function is trying to access `self.app.config.SERVER_NAME`, which is resulting in a KeyError because the 'SERVER_NAME' attribute is not present in the configuration.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is trying to use `self.app.config.SERVER_NAME` without checking if it exists in the configuration.

One approach to fixing the bug is to modify the function to first check if 'SERVER_NAME' is present in the configuration before accessing it. If it's not present, appropriate default behavior should be defined.

Here is the corrected code for the `url_for` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming to generate correct scheme & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    if hasattr(self.app.config, 'SERVER_NAME'):
        if "//" in self.app.config.SERVER_NAME:
            return self.app.url_for(view_name, _external=True, **kwargs)

    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.server_name
    port = self.server_port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `url_for` function first checks if the 'SERVER_NAME' attribute exists in the configuration before using it. This prevents the KeyError from occurring. If the attribute is not present, the function can implement a default behavior.
