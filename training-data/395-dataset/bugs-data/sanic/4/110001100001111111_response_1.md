The error is occurring in the `url_for` function of the `Request` class. The error message indicates that there is a KeyError for 'SERVER_NAME' in `self.app.config`. This means that the `SERVER_NAME` is not defined in the `config` attribute of the app.

The bug is occurring because the `url_for` method is trying to access the `SERVER_NAME` attribute from the app's config, but it is not finding it. The method then tries to generate a URL based on the `scheme`, `host`, and `port` attributes of the Request class, but it is not handling the case where the `SERVER_NAME` is not defined in the app's config.

To fix this bug, the `url_for` method needs to be modified to handle the situation where the `SERVER_NAME` is not defined in the app's config. It should generate the URL based on the `scheme`, `host`, and `port` attributes directly.

Below is the corrected code for the `url_for` method:
```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.server_name
    port = self.server_port
    netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

With this correction, the `url_for` method will directly use the `scheme`, `host`, and `port` attributes to generate the URL, without relying on the `SERVER_NAME` attribute from the app's config.
