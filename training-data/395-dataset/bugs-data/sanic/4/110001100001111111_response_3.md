Based on the input parameters and their values provided, the bug seems to be related to the usage of `self.app.config.SERVER_NAME` in the `url_for` function. The error message received from a user indicates that a KeyError is being raised for 'SERVER_NAME' when using `request.url_for`.

The bug is likely occurring because the `SERVER_NAME` is not being set in the configuration, causing the `url_for` function to fail when trying to access `self.app.config.SERVER_NAME`. 

To fix this, the `url_for` function can be modified to check if `SERVER_NAME` is present in the configuration before using it. If it's not present, a default value or a different method of determining the server name can be used.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_for` function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.
    
    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    if hasattr(self.app.config, 'SERVER_NAME'):
        if "//" in self.app.config.SERVER_NAME:
            return self.app.url_for(view_name, _external=True, **kwargs)

    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.server_name
    port = self.server_port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

In this corrected code, we first check if the `SERVER_NAME` is present in the configuration before using it. If it is present, we proceed with the original logic. If not, we can handle this differently based on the specific requirements of the application.

This change should address the KeyError related to 'SERVER_NAME' and provide a more robust implementation of the `url_for` function.
