The error message indicates a 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable, which means that the response.json["url"] is returning None instead of the expected URL.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `url_for` method.

The bug is occurring because the `url_for` method is not properly determining the scheme and netloc based on the request, which leads to the None response.

To fix the bug, the method should correctly determine the scheme and netloc based on the request and then generate the absolute URL to the given view.

Here is the corrected code for the `url_for` method:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.server_name
    port = self.server_port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

By removing the condition `if "//" in self.app.config.SERVER_NAME` and directly determining the scheme and netloc based on the request, we can ensure that the correct absolute URL is generated.
