The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the conditional check for the presence of "//" in the SERVER_NAME configuration. Based on the error message provided, it seems that the function is trying to access the SERVER_NAME from the app configuration, but it is not present, leading to a KeyError.

The bug is occurring because the logic to determine schema and netloc based on the request is not handling the case where the SERVER_NAME is not present in the app configuration.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the function to handle the case where the SERVER_NAME is not present in the app configuration. This can be done by using the request object to retrieve the scheme, host, and port information.

Additionally, the scheme, host, port, and netloc variables should be properly initialized based on the request information.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    scheme = self.request.scheme
    host = self.request.host
    port = self.request.port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

In the corrected code, the scheme, host, and port are retrieved from the request object, and the netloc is constructed based on these values. This ensures that the function generates a correct absolute URL to the given view.
