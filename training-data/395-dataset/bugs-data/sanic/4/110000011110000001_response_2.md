The error is a NoneType error, which means that the response.json object is None and cannot be subscripted (i.e., no values can be retrieved from it).

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the url_for method. It seems that the method is not returning a valid URL, causing the response.json to be None.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be that the url_for method is not correctly generating the URL, possibly due to the logic for determining the scheme and netloc.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to review the logic for determining the scheme and netloc in the url_for method. It may be necessary to revise the logic to ensure that the correct scheme and netloc are being used to generate the URL.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    scheme = self.request.scheme
    host = self.request.host
    port = self.request.port

    if (scheme.lower() in ("http", "ws") and port == 80) or (
        scheme.lower() in ("https", "wss") and port == 443
    ):
        netloc = host
    else:
        netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port)

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

This code retrieves the scheme, host, and port from the request object and uses them to generate the correct URL.
