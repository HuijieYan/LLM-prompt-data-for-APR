The error message "TypeError: 'NoneType' object is not subscriptable" is likely occurring because the `response.json` is None. This could be because the `url_for` function is not returning the expected value.

The potential error location within the `url_for` function is the calculation of the `netloc` variable. 

The bug occurs because the condition for determining the `netloc` value is not properly handled. As a result, the wrong `_scheme` and `_server` parameters are passed to the `app.url_for` method.

To fix the bug, we can update the calculation of the `netloc` variable based on the condition for the `scheme` and `port` combination.

Here is the corrected code for the `url_for` function:

```python
def url_for(self, view_name, **kwargs):
    """
    Same as :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`, but automatically determine
    `scheme` and `netloc` base on the request. Since this method is aiming
    to generate correct schema & netloc, `_external` is implied.

    :param kwargs: takes same parameters as in :func:`sanic.Sanic.url_for`
    :return: an absolute url to the given view
    :rtype: str
    """
    # Full URL SERVER_NAME can only be handled in app.url_for
    if "//" in self.app.config.SERVER_NAME:
        return self.app.url_for(view_name, _external=True, **kwargs)

    scheme = self.scheme
    host = self.server_name
    port = self.server_port

    netloc = "{}:{}".format(host, port) if port else host

    return self.app.url_for(
        view_name, _external=True, _scheme=scheme, _server=netloc, **kwargs
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `netloc` is calculated based on the presence of the `port`. If a port is provided, the `netloc` is set as the combination of the `host` and `port`. If no port is provided, the `netloc` is simply set to the `host`. This approach ensures that the correct `_scheme` and `_server` parameters are passed to the `app.url_for` method.
