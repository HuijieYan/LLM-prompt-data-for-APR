The issue description is:

```text
I use python3.7，It default coding is 'utf-8', So I didn't add "#--coding: utf-8--" to the first line of my file.

But when I used PySnooper, I found an error:

  `UnicodeEncodeError: 'gbk' codec can't encode character '\ufffd' in position 69: illegal multibyte sequence`
Code location：tracer.py 134th line

My solution is:

# tracer.py 134 line
def write(self, s):
        - with open(self.path, 'w' if self.overwrite else 'a') as output_file:
       + with open(self.path, 'w' if self.overwrite else 'a', encoding='utf-8') as output_file:
            output_file.write(s)
        self.overwrite = False
and add "#--coding: utf-8--" in my file

I look forward to better solutions, Thanks.
```
