The issue description is:

```text
I was trying it on a toy example and just wanted to pass in one tuple like
(list, print_list_size) to custom_repr= () with print_list_size being the example used in the readme file:
def print_list_size(l): return 'list(size={})'.format(len(l))

There was an exception:" TypeError: cannot unpack non-iterable function object."
I think the problem lies in that custom_repr is a tuple of tuples thus when it has only one element it won't be unpacked successfully.
I changed custom_repr = [ ] and then put in the tuple (list, print_list_size) and it worked. Or, put an extra , in the tuple such like this:
@pysnooper.snoop(custom_repr = ( (list, print_list_size), ))

Just a small issue but hopefully this would be beneficial for other people.
