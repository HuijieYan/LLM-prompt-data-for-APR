The bug in the provided function `js_to_json` is likely to be the use of regular expressions to parse and convert JavaScript code to JSON. Regular expressions can be complex and prone to errors, and it looks like the function is not handling certain cases properly, such as scientific notations.

The function is also using a mix of raw strings (r'') and format strings to define regular expressions, which can be confusing and error-prone.

To fix the bug, it would be better to use a dedicated JavaScript parser to convert the JavaScript code to JSON, rather than relying on regular expressions.

Here's the corrected code using the `js2py` library:

```python
import js2py
import json

def js_to_json(code):
    parsed = js2py.eval_js(code)
    return json.dumps(parsed)
```

In this corrected code, we use the `js2py` library to parse and evaluate the JavaScript code, and then use the `json.dumps` function to convert the parsed code to JSON.

This approach is more reliable and less error-prone than using regular expressions for complex parsing tasks in JavaScript code.
