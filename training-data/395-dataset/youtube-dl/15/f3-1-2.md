Description of your issue, suggested solution and other information
Most twitch clips work just fine, but this specific one causes problems (https://clips.twitch.tv/CarelessZealousKangarooNerfBlueBlaster).

Looking at the js/json string being parsed suggests that its segments value, which is null for all working clips including youtube-dl's test URLs, is the culprit. The original form of this line is

segments: [{"playback_offset":0,"offset":-3.885780586188048e-16,"duration":39.75000000000001,"speed":1}],

which gets transformed into

"segments": [{"playback_offset":0,"offset":-3.885780586188048"e"-16,"duration":39.75000000000001,"speed":1}],

This adds quotation marks around the exponent marker which causes the error.
```
