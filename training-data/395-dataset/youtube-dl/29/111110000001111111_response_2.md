The bug in the provided function `unified_strdate` is likely due to the `upload_date` variable not being set to a default value before the loop, leading to potential NoneType errors. This can cause the function to return `None` when it should return a string with the date in the format `YYYYMMDD`.

To fix the bug, you can set the `upload_date` variable to an empty string before the loop, so that even if no match is found in the loop, it returns an empty string instead of `None`.

Here's the corrected code for the `unified_strdate` function:

```python
import re
import datetime
import email.utils

def unified_strdate(date_str, day_first=True):
    """Return a string with the date in the format YYYYMMDD"""
    
    if date_str is None:
        return None
    upload_date = ''  # Setting upload_date to an empty string instead of None
    # ... (the remaining code remains the same)
    
    return upload_date  # Returning an empty string instead of None
```

By setting the `upload_date` variable to an empty string, we ensure that the function always returns a string, even if no valid date is found.
