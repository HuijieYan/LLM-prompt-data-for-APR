The bug in the provided code is occurring because the regular expressions used to match the date format are not capturing all the date formats provided. Additionally, the approach of iterating through all format expressions and trying to parse the date using each one is not efficient.

To fix the bug, the regular expressions for date format matching should be expanded to cover all the different date formats in the `format_expressions` list. Additionally, a more efficient approach for parsing the date would be to use `dateutil.parser` module in Python, which is able to parse dates from a wide variety of formats.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
import dateutil.parser

def unified_strdate(date_str, day_first=True):
    """Return a string with the date in the format YYYYMMDD"""

    if date_str is None:
        return None
    
    try:
        upload_date = dateutil.parser.parse(date_str, dayfirst=day_first).strftime('%Y%m%d')
        return upload_date
    except ValueError:
        return None
```

By using `dateutil.parser`, we can simplify the code and cover many more date formats without having to manually write regular expressions for each one. This ensures better coverage of different date formats and improves the overall robustness of the function.
