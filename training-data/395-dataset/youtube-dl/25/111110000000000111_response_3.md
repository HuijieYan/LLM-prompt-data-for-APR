The given function is supposed to convert JavaScript code to JSON format. However, there are several issues with the function that need to be fixed.

Upon analysis, the potential error location within the problematic function is the `fix_kv` function, which is responsible for fixing key-value pairs in the JavaScript code.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the regular expressions and logic used in the `fix_kv` function are not handling the JavaScript code conversion to JSON correctly. Additionally, the function is missing the `re` module import.

To fix the bug, we can use the `json` module in Python to properly convert the JavaScript code to JSON format.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import json

def js_to_json(code):
    return json.dumps(code)
```

This corrected function utilizes the `json.dumps` method to convert the JavaScript code to JSON format, which is a more reliable and efficient approach.
