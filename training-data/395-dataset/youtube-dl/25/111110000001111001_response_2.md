The buggy function `js_to_json` has an issue with the regular expression used in `re.sub`. The function is attempting to convert JavaScript code to JSON format, but it is not handling some cases properly.

The `fix_kv` function seems to handle cases such as escaping characters and converting integers, but it is not working as intended due to the irregular regular expression matching.

The buggy function is trying to handle various cases such as strings, comments, integers, etc. It uses a complex regular expression to match these cases, but the expression is likely not covering all possible scenarios.

To fix the bug, the approach should be to use a more robust and tested library or parser for converting JavaScript to JSON. Using a custom regular expression-based approach is error-prone and difficult to maintain. The `re.sub` function should be replaced with a proper JSON-parsing library such as `json` in Python.

Here's the corrected code using the `json` library:

```python
import json

def js_to_json(code):
    return json.dumps(json.loads(code))
```

This approach leverages the `json.loads` function to convert the JavaScript code into a Python structure, then `json.dumps` to convert it back into valid JSON. This way, we are using a well-tested and maintained library to handle the conversion, which should eliminate the bugs in the original `js_to_json` function.
