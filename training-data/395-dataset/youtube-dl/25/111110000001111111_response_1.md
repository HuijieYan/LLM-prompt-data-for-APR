The `js_to_json` function is intended to convert JavaScript code to JSON format, but it contains some errors that prevent it from working correctly.

The function seems to be using regular expressions to match and transform various parts of the JavaScript code. However, the implementation of the `fix_kv` function, which is responsible for converting individual key-value pairs, contains some errors. Additionally, the usage of regular expressions within the function is complex and error-prone.

The potential reasons behind the occurrence of the bug could be:
1. Incorrect handling of key-value pairs within the `fix_kv` function.
2. Complex and error-prone regular expressions used to match JavaScript code.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to use a more structured approach for parsing JavaScript code, such as using a dedicated library for parsing and converting JavaScript to JSON. This would ensure better accuracy and reliability compared to using custom regular expressions.

Here's the corrected code for the `js_to_json` function using the `json` library for parsing:

```python
import json

def js_to_json(code):
    # Using the json.loads function to parse JavaScript code to JSON
    json_data = json.loads(code)
    # Returning the JSON object
    return json_data
```
