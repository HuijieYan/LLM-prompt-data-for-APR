The issue with the `js_to_json` function is that it is not correctly converting JavaScript code to JSON. The variable `fix_kv` is a nested function within `js_to_json` and is responsible for fixing key-value pairs in the JavaScript code.

The bug in the `js_to_json` function is that it is not handling the input code correctly. The regular expression used in the `re.sub` function inside the `js_to_json` function is not properly parsing the input code to convert it to JSON.

To fix the bug, a better approach would be to use a dedicated JavaScript to JSON conversion library in Python, such as `demjson` or `simplejson`. These libraries handle the conversion from JavaScript to JSON in a much more reliable and efficient manner.

Here's the corrected and simplified version of the `js_to_json` function using the `demjson` library:

```python
import demjson

def js_to_json(code):
    return demjson.decode(code)
```

Using the `demjson.decode` function from the `demjson` library simplifies the process and ensures accurate conversion from JavaScript to JSON.
