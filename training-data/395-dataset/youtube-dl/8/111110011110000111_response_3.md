The error occurs in the `_build_selector_function` function of the `YoutubeDL` class when it encounters a `None` value for the `selector` parameter. This `None` value is being checked for its `type` attribute, which results in the `AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'type'` error.

The potential error location is within the `_build_selector_function` function where the `selector` parameter is being accessed without proper validation for its existence.

The bug occurred because the function was assuming that the `selector` parameter would always have a valid value, but in this case, it received a `None` value.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure that the `selector` parameter is not `None` before attempting to access its attributes.

Here's the corrected code for the `build_format_selector` method:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # previous code remains the same

    def _build_selector_function(selector):
        if selector is None:
            return lambda formats: iter([])  # Return an empty iterator if selector is None
        if isinstance(selector, list):
            fs = [_build_selector_function(s) for s in selector]

            def selector_function(formats):
                for f in fs:
                    for format in f(formats):
                        yield format
            return selector_function
        elif selector.type == GROUP:
            selector_function = _build_selector_function(selector.selector)
            # remaining code remains the same
```

By adding a check for `None` in the `_build_selector_function`, we ensure that the function handles the case when `selector` is `None` and avoids the `AttributeError` that was occurring. Now, the function returns an empty iterator if the `selector` is `None`.
