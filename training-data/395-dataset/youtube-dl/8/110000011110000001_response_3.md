The test case seems to be using the `build_format_selector` function from the `YoutubeDL` class. The error message indicates that the error is occurring when the `build_format_selector` function is trying to access the `type` attribute of a `NoneType` object.

The potential error location within the `build_format_selector` function seems to be in the `_build_selector_function` section where it checks if the `selector` is a list or if it has a `type` attribute.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely due to the `selector` being `None` at the point where it is being checked for its `type` attribute.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `selector` is not `None` before trying to access its `type` attribute.

Here's the corrected code for the `build_format_selector` function:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # existing code...

    def _build_selector_function(selector):
        if selector is None:
            return lambda formats: []
        elif isinstance(selector, list):
            fs = [_build_selector_function(s) for s in selector]

            def selector_function(formats):
                for f in fs:
                    for format in f(formats):
                        yield format
            return selector_function
        elif selector.type == GROUP:
            selector_function = _build_selector_function(selector.selector)
            return selector_function
        # existing code...

    # existing code...
```

By checking if the `selector` is `None` at the beginning of the `_build_selector_function`, we can prevent the AttributeError from occurring and return an appropriate result if `selector` is `None`.
