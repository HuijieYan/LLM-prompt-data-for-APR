The error occurs because the `selector` variable is set to `None` in the `_parse_format_selection` function, and then it is used without checking if it is not `None` in the `_build_selector_function` function. This leads to the AttributeError when trying to access the `type` attribute of `None` in the `elif selector.type == GROUP` line.

To fix this bug, we need to add a check to ensure that `selector` is not `None` before trying to access its attributes.

Here is the corrected code for the `build_format_selector` function:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # other code...
    
    def _build_selector_function(selector):
        if selector is None:
            return lambda formats: iter([])
        
        if isinstance(selector, list):
            fs = [_build_selector_function(s) for s in selector]
    
            def selector_function(formats):
                for f in fs:
                    for format in f(formats):
                        yield format
            return selector_function
        elif selector.type == GROUP:
            selector_function = _build_selector_function(selector.selector)
        # other existing code...
    
    # other code...
```

In this corrected code, we added a check for `selector` being `None` at the beginning of the `_build_selector_function` and return an empty iterator if it is `None`. This prevents the AttributeError that was occurring in the previous version of the code.
