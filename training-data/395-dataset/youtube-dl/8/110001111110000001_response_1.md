The error occurs when the function `build_format_selector` is trying to build the selector function. In the if-elif ladder used to determine the type of selector, at one point, the `selector` is being compared to `None` without being checked for its validity, resulting in the AttributeError.

The potential error location is the part of the `build_format_selector` function which handles the `selector` object.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `selector` object is not being checked before accessing its `type` attribute. This means that the code tries to access the `type` attribute of a potentially None object, leading to the AttributeError.

To fix the bug, the code should first check if the `selector` object is not None before attempting to access its `type` attribute. This can be done by adding a conditional statement to handle the None case.

Here's the corrected code for the `build_format_selector` function:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # previous code remains the same

    def _build_selector_function(selector):
        if selector is None:
            return
        if isinstance(selector, list):
            fs = [_build_selector_function(s) for s in selector]

            def selector_function(formats):
                for f in fs:
                    for format in f(formats):
                        yield format
            return selector_function
        elif selector.type == GROUP:
            selector_function = _build_selector_function(selector.selector)
            # remaining code
```

With this fix, the code first checks if the `selector` is not None before proceeding with its further processing.
