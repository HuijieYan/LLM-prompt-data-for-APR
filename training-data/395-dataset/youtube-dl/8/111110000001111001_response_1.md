Potential Error Location: The `format_spec` variable is not defined anywhere in the function. It should be passed as an input parameter to the `build_format_selector` function.

Reasons for the Bug: The `format_spec` variable is not defined within the function, which means it cannot be used within the function. This leads to a runtime error.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug: 
1. Pass `format_spec` as an input parameter to the `build_format_selector` function so that it can be used within the function.
2. Ensure that all variables used within the function are either passed as parameters or defined within the function.

Corrected Code:
```python
# Buggy function with corrected code
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    def syntax_error(note, start):
        message = (
            'Invalid format specification: '
            '{0}\n\t{1}\n\t{2}^'.format(note, format_spec, ' ' * start[1]))
        return SyntaxError(message)

    PICKFIRST = 'PICKFIRST'
    MERGE = 'MERGE'
    SINGLE = 'SINGLE'
    GROUP = 'GROUP'
    
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ... (other parts of the function) ...
```
In the corrected code, the `format_spec` variable is passed as an input parameter to the `build_format_selector` function so that it can be used within the function.
