The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `_build_selector_function` method, specifically in the handling of the `TokenIterator` class and its `__next__` method.

The bug seems to be occurring due to the incorrect usage of the `TokenIterator` class and its `__next__` method. The `TokenIterator` class does not correctly implement the `__next__` method and instead uses `next` as an alias for `__next__`. This can lead to unexpected behavior and errors when iterating over the tokens.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the `TokenIterator` class implements the `__next__` method correctly and follows the Python iterator protocol.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # ... (other code)

    class TokenIterator(object):
        def __init__(self, tokens):
            self.tokens = tokens
            self.counter = 0

        def __iter__(self):
            return self

        def __next__(self):
            if self.counter >= len(self.tokens):
                raise StopIteration()
            value = self.tokens[self.counter]
            self.counter += 1
            return value

    parsed_selector = _parse_format_selection(TokenIterator(tokens))
    return _build_selector_function(parsed_selector)
```

In the corrected code, the `TokenIterator` class correctly implements the `__next__` method as per the Python iterator protocol. This should help in resolving the bug and ensure proper iteration over the tokens.
