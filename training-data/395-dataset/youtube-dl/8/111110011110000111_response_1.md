Analysis:
The error occurs at the line `fs = [_build_selector_function(s) for s in selector]` within the `_build_selector_function` method. It seems that the variable `selector` is set to `None`, causing the AttributeError when trying to access its `type`.

Reasons behind the bug:
The potential reason for the variable `selector` being `None` is that there is an issue with parsing the format specification and creating the `parsed_selector` in the `build_format_selector` method. This issue leads to `selector` being `None`, causing the AttributeError during the function execution.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Validate the format specification parsing to ensure that `parsed_selector` is created correctly. If there's an issue with the format specification, handle it appropriately with error messages or fallback options.
2. Check for potential edge cases in the format specifications that could lead to `parsed_selector` being `None`, and address these cases in the code.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected build_format_selector function
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # ... existing code ...

    parsed_selector = _parse_format_selection(iter(TokenIterator(tokens)))
    if parsed_selector:
        return _build_selector_function(parsed_selector)
    else:
        raise ValueError("Error in parsing format specification")

# Rest of the class and methods remain unchanged
```

In the corrected `build_format_selector` function, we added a check for `parsed_selector` to ensure that it is not `None` before using it to create the selector function. If `parsed_selector` is `None`, a ValueError is raised to indicate an error in parsing the format specification. This modification helps to handle the potential issue of `parsed_selector` being `None` and provides a clear error message for debugging.
