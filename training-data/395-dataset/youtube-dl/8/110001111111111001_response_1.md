The error occurs when the `_build_selector_function` function is called. It seems that the `selector` variable is `None`, which leads to an `AttributeError` when trying to access its `type` attribute.

The potential reason for this bug is that the `parsed_selector` returned from `_parse_format_selection` may be `None` or may contain `None` values, leading to the bug.

To fix this bug, we should first check the value of `parsed_selector` before calling `_build_selector_function`. If it is `None`, we can return a default value or handle the situation appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `build_format_selector` function:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # ... (previous code remains unchanged)

    parsed_selector = _parse_format_selection(iter(TokenIterator(tokens)))
    if parsed_selector is None:
        # Return a default value or handle the situation appropriately
        def default_selector_function(formats):
            return formats
        return default_selector_function

    return _build_selector_function(parsed_selector)
```

By checking the value of `parsed_selector`, we ensure that we are not trying to operate on a `None` value and handle this situation appropriately. This should prevent the `AttributeError` from occurring.
