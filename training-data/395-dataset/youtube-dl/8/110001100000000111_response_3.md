The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `syntax_error` function. The function is trying to return an instance of a SyntaxError, but it's not defined correctly for it to be returned.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `syntax_error` function is not returning the SyntaxError instance as expected, and its content is not properly defined.

To fix the bug, the `syntax_error` function needs to be defined to return a SyntaxError instance with the correct message.

The corrected code for the problematic function would be as follows:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    def syntax_error(note, start):
        message = (
            'Invalid format specification: '
            '{0}\n\t{1}\n\t{2}^'.format(note, format_spec, ' ' * start[1]))
        raise SyntaxError(message)  # Using `raise` instead of returning a SyntaxError instance

    # rest of the code remains unchanged
```
