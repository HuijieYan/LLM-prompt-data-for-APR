The potential error in the code is in the `build_format_selector` method. The code tries to define a namedtuple 'FormatSelector' but it's missing the import statement for namedtuple. Another issue is with the way the named tuple is defined and used without importing the necessary module.

The bug occurred because the namedtuple 'FormatSelector' was used without importing the 'collections' module which contains the 'namedtuple' class. Additionally, in the code, the 'tokenize' module is used without being imported which will result in a NameError.

To fix the bug, we need to import the necessary modules and properly define the named tuple.

Here's the corrected code for the `build_format_selector` method with the necessary imports:

```python
import collections
import tokenize
import itertools
import io
import compat_tokenize_tokenize  # Assuming this function is defined elsewhere

class YoutubeDL(object):
    # ... [other methods]
    def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
        def syntax_error(note, start):
            message = (
                'Invalid format specification: '
                '{0}\n\t{1}\n\t{2}^'.format(note, format_spec, ' ' * start[1]))
            return SyntaxError(message)
    
        FormatSelector = collections.namedtuple('FormatSelector', ['type', 'selector', 'filters'])
        
        # Rest of the code remains unchanged
```
