The error occurs in the `_build_selector_function` method. When the `selector` parameter is `None`, it tries to access the `type` attribute of `None`, resulting in the `AttributeError`.

The reason for the bug is that the `selector` parameter is not handled properly when it is `None`.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to handle the case when `selector` is `None`. We will return a simple function that does not yield any results in this case.

Here's the corrected code for the `build_format_selector` method:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # ... (previous code remains unchanged)

    def _build_selector_function(selector):
        if selector is None:
            def empty_selector_function(formats):
                return
            return empty_selector_function
        if isinstance(selector, list):
            fs = [_build_selector_function(s) for s in selector]
            def selector_function(formats):
                for f in fs:
                    for format in f(formats):
                        yield format
            return selector_function
        elif selector.type == GROUP:
            selector_function = _build_selector_function(selector.selector)
            # ... (remaining code remains unchanged)
    
    # ... (remaining code remains unchanged)

    parsed_selector = _parse_format_selection(iter(TokenIterator(tokens)))
    return _build_selector_function(parsed_selector)
```

In the `_build_selector_function`, we added a check for `selector` being `None` at the beginning. If `selector` is `None`, the method `empty_selector_function` is returned, which does nothing.
