The issue in the function seems to be that the `TokenIterator` class is defined within the `build_format_selector` function, but it is trying to access attributes of the parent class `self` inside the `TokenIterator` class. However, the `self` object is not passed as an argument to the `TokenIterator` class, leading to the error.

To fix this issue, `self` should be passed as an argument when creating the `TokenIterator` object.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# Corrected function
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # existing function code here

    class TokenIterator(object):
        def __init__(self, tokens, parent_self):  # Pass `self` as an argument
            self.tokens = tokens
            self.counter = 0
            self.parent_self = parent_self  # Capture `self` in the TokenIterator

        # remaining functions of the TokenIterator class

    parsed_selector = _parse_format_selection(iter(TokenIterator(tokens, self)))  # Pass `self` to the TokenIterator
    return _build_selector_function(parsed_selector)
```

In summary, the `TokenIterator` class constructor now accepts `parent_self` as an additional parameter to capture the `self` object. When creating the `TokenIterator` object, it is passed `tokens` and `self`. This ensures that the `TokenIterator` has access to the `self` attributes.
