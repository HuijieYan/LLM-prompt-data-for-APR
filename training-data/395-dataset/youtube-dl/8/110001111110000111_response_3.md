The error occurs when the function `build_format_selector` is called and tries to execute the line `return _build_selector_function(parsed_selector)`. The error message indicates that the `selector` variable is `None`, and the subsequent check for `selector.type` raises an `AttributeError` as a result.

The bug is likely caused by not properly parsing the format specification or encountering an empty format selector.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when the `parsed_selector` is `None` and return an appropriate result or handle it differently.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    def syntax_error(note, start):
        message = (
            'Invalid format specification: '
            '{0}\n\t{1}\n\t{2}^'.format(note, format_spec, ' ' * start[1]))
        return SyntaxError(message)

    if parsed_selector is None:
        # Return an appropriate value or handle the None case
        return None  # This is a placeholder and should be customized based on the specific requirement

    # rest of the function remains the same...
    # ... omitted for brevity ...

    parsed_selector = _parse_format_selection(iter(TokenIterator(tokens)))
    return _build_selector_function(parsed_selector)
```

It's important to handle the case when `parsed_selector` is `None` appropriately based on the requirement or the specific use case. For demonstration purposes, the placeholder `return None` has been used, but it should be replaced with the proper logic for handling this case.
