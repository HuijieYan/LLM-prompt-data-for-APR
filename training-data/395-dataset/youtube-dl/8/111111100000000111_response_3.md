The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `_parse_filter` and `_parse_format_selection` functions. It seems that these functions are not defined properly and cause syntax errors.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug include:
1. The `_parse_filter` function is incomplete and may not correctly handle the flow control in the loop.
2. The `_parse_format_selection` function also seems to be lacking proper handling of loop conditions and control flow.

To fix the bug, the `_parse_filter` and `_parse_format_selection` functions need to be completed with proper loop conditions and control flow to ensure they can correctly parse and handle the format specifications.

Here's the corrected code for the `build_format_selector` function:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # existing code...
    ## _parse_filter and _parse_format_selection definition
    ## ...
    
    def _parse_filter(tokens, stream):
        filter_parts = []
        for type, string, start, _, _ in tokens:
            if type == tokenize.OP and string == ']':
                return ''.join(filter_parts)
            else:
                filter_parts.append(string)

    def _parse_format_selection(tokens, inside_merge=False, inside_choice=False, inside_group=False):
        selectors = []
        current_selector = None
        for type, string, start, _, _ in tokens:
            if type == getattr(tokenize, 'ENCODING', None):
                continue
            elif type in [tokenize.NAME, tokenize.NUMBER]:
                current_selector = FormatSelector(SINGLE, string, [])
            # remaining code...

    # existing code...
    ## _build_selector_function definition
    ## ...
```
