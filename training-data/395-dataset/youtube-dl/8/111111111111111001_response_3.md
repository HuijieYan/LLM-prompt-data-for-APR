The error message shows that there is an AttributeError because the 'selector' is None. This suggests that the parsing of the format_spec in the build_format_selector method is not generating the expected output.

The potential error location within the build_format_selector method is the parsing and processing of the format_spec, specifically in the _parse_format_selection and _build_selector_function functions.

The bug occurs because the parsing and processing of the format_spec is not handling unexpected cases, leading to the 'selector' being None. This could be due to errors in the logic of the parsing and processing functions.

To fix the bug, the parsing and processing functions, specifically _parse_format_selection and _build_selector_function, should be thoroughly reviewed and tested with various format_spec inputs to ensure they handle all cases correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the build_format_selector method:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    ...
    parsed_selector = _parse_format_selection(TokenIterator(tokens))
    
    def _build_selector_function(selector):
        if not selector:  # Check if selector is None
            return lambda formats: iter([])
    
        if isinstance(selector, list):
            fs = [_build_selector_function(s) for s in selector]

            def selector_function(formats):
                for f in fs:
                    for format in f(formats):
                        yield format
            return selector_function
    ...
    return _build_selector_function(parsed_selector)
```

In the corrected code, additional checks have been added to handle the case when the 'selector' is None. This should prevent the AttributeError from occurring. Additionally, the parsing logic should also be thoroughly reviewed to ensure it correctly processes the format_spec.
