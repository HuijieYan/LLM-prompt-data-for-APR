The error occurs because the `selector` object within the `_build_selector_function` function is `None`, causing an AttributeError when trying to access its `type` attribute.

The bug is likely due to incorrect parsing and processing of the `parsed_selector` object, which should be a list of selectors but might be empty or `None` in this case.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `parsed_selector` is properly processed and the `selector` object within the `_build_selector_function` function is not `None` before accessing its `type` attribute.

Below is the corrected code for the `build_format_selector` function:

```python
import collections
import io
import tokenize
import itertools

def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # unchanged section...
    # ... (same content as the original function)

    parsed_selector = _parse_format_selection(tokens)
    if parsed_selector:
        return _build_selector_function(parsed_selector)
    else:
        raise SyntaxError('Parsed selector is empty or None')

# unchanged section...

def selector_function(formats):
    for f in fs:
        for format in f(formats):
            yield format

def _build_selector_function(selector):
    fs = [_build_selector_function(s) for s in selector]

    def selector_function(formats):
        for f in fs:
            for format in f(formats):
                yield format
    return selector_function

# unchanged section...
# ... (rest of the original function remains unchanged)
``` 

In the corrected function, we have added a check to ensure that the `parsed_selector` object is not empty or `None` before calling the `_build_selector_function`. Additionally, we have modified the `selector_function` inside the `_build_selector_function` to avoid potential issues with the `selector` object being `None`.
