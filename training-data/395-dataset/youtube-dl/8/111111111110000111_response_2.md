The error message indicates that the code is encountering an `AttributeError` because it is trying to access the `type` attribute of a `NoneType` object. This suggests that the variable `selector` is `None` when it is used in the function `_build_selector_function`.

The potential error location within the `build_format_selector` function is when the `selector` variable is being used to access its `type` attribute without checking if it's `None`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code is not properly handling the case when `selector` is `None`, leading to the `AttributeError` due to trying to access the `type` attribute of `None`.

To fix the bug, we need to add an explicit condition to handle the case when `selector` is `None` before accessing its attributes.

Here's the corrected code for the `build_format_selector` function:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # existing code ...

    def _build_selector_function(selector):
        if selector is None:
            return lambda formats: formats  # Return identity selector if selector is None
        elif isinstance(selector, list):
            fs = [_build_selector_function(s) for s in selector]

            def selector_function(formats):
                for f in fs:
                    for _format in f(formats):
                        yield _format
            return selector_function
        elif selector.type == GROUP:
            selector_function = _build_selector_function(selector.selector)
            return selector_function
        # existing code ...
```

In the corrected code, an additional check is added at the beginning of the `_build_selector_function` to handle the case when `selector` is `None`. This case returns a lambda function that simply returns the input `formats`, effectively acting as an identity selector when `selector` is `None`.
