The potential error in the given function arises from the way the 'TokenIterator' class is used. It seems that 'TokenIterator' is designed to iterate through the tokens by implementing the '__next__' method, but the buggy function overrides the method with 'next'. 

To fix this issue, the name of the 'next' method within the 'TokenIterator' class should be changed to '__next__', which is the correct implementation for iterator classes.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...
    class TokenIterator(object):
        def __init__(self, tokens):
            self.tokens = tokens
            self.counter = 0

        def __iter__(self):
            return self

        def __next__(self):
            if self.counter >= len(self.tokens):
                raise StopIteration()
            value = self.tokens[self.counter]
            self.counter += 1
            return value

        def restore_last_token(self):
            self.counter -= 1

    parsed_selector = _parse_format_selection(iter(TokenIterator(tokens)))
    return _build_selector_function(parsed_selector)
```

With this correction, the 'TokenIterator' class correctly implements the iterator protocol, ensuring that the 'next' method can be used to iterate through the tokens in a consistent manner.

By making this change, the bug related to the 'TokenIterator' class should be resolved, and the function should work as expected.
