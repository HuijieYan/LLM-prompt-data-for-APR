The error seems to be occurring in the `_build_selector_function` method when it tries to handle cases where `selector` is `None`. This is likely due to the fact that the parsed selector obtained from the input format specification `format_spec` is not being correctly processed, leading to a `None` value for `selector`.

The bug is occurring because the function `_parse_format_selection` is not correctly parsing the format specification tokens and constructing the `parsed_selector`, which is resulting in it being `None`. This is leading to the issue in the `_build_selector_function`.

To fix the bug, the `_parse_format_selection` function should be carefully inspected and debugged to ensure that it constructs the `parsed_selector` correctly. This can be achieved by carefully checking the token parsing logic and making sure that it correctly handles all the different cases present in the format specification.

Another possible approach for fixing the bug is to add additional validation checks in the `_build_selector_function` to ensure that it handles the `None` case more gracefully.

Below is the corrected code for the `_build_format_selector` method:

```python
# Corrected function
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged) ...

    try:
        parsed_selector = _parse_format_selection(iter(TokenIterator(tokens)))
        if parsed_selector is None:
            # Handle None case
            raise SyntaxError('Unable to parse the format specification')
        return _build_selector_function(parsed_selector)
    except Exception as e:
        # Handle any exceptions that occur during parsing
        raise SyntaxError('Invalid format specification: {0}\nError: {1}'.format(format_spec, e))
```

In the corrected code, the try-except block is used to catch any exceptions that may occur during the parsing and processing of the format specification. Additionally, it also checks if the `parsed_selector` is `None` and raises a `SyntaxError` accordingly.

By handling the potential `None` case and adding better exception handling, the corrected function should be able to handle the buggy scenario more gracefully and accurately.
