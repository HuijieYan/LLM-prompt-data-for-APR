The error is occurring within the `_build_selector_function` method of the `YoutubeDL` class. The error message indicates that the `selector` object is `None` and hence does not have an attribute `type`.

The potential reason for this bug is that the `selector` object is not being properly assigned a value, leading to it being `None` when the method is called.

To fix this bug, the `selector` object needs to be properly assigned a value before it is used in the function logic.

Here's the corrected code for the `build_format_selector` method:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # existing code - omitted for brevity

    parsed_selector = _parse_format_selection(iter(TokenIterator(tokens)))
    if parsed_selector:  # Check if parsed_selector is not None
        return _build_selector_function(parsed_selector)
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid format specification")
```

In the corrected code, we added a conditional check to ensure that `parsed_selector` is not `None` before calling the `_build_selector_function`.

By adding this check, we ensure that the `parsed_selector` is not `None`, thus avoiding the AttributeError when accessing the `type` attribute of the `selector` object.
