The test case `test_youtube_format_selection` creates an instance of the `YoutubeDL` class and attempts to use the `build_format_selector` method by passing different format specifications. The error occurs in the `build_format_selector` method, specifically when trying to access the `type` attribute of `selector`, which is `None`. This raises an `AttributeError`.

The reason behind the bug is that the `selector` variable becomes `None` due to incorrect handling within the function. This results in the subsequent access of the `type` attribute causing the error.

To fix the bug:
1. Ensure that the `selector` variable is not `None` before attempting to access its attributes.
2. Handle the case where `selector` is `None` appropriately to avoid the `AttributeError`.

Here's the corrected code for the `build_format_selector` method:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # ... (other existing code) ...

    def _build_selector_function(selector):
        if selector is None:
            return lambda formats: []
        if isinstance(selector, list):
            fs = [_build_selector_function(s) for s in selector]
            def selector_function(formats):
                for f in fs:
                    for format in f(formats):
                        yield format
            return selector_function
        # rest of the code remains the same...

    # existing code remains the same...
```

By adding a check for `None` to the `_build_selector_function` as shown above, the method will now return an empty list if the `selector` is `None`, preventing the `AttributeError` that was encountered previously.
