The error message indicates that the function `interpret_expression` encountered an unsupported JavaScript expression 'x()'. This expression is unsupported because the function is not set up to handle function calls in this specific format.

The potential error location is within the conditions that handle function calls in the `interpret_expression` function. It seems that the function is not able to properly interpret and execute JavaScript function calls.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not handling JavaScript function calls in a comprehensive manner. It is failing to properly parse and interpret the function call expression 'x()', leading to the unsupported expression error.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to handle function calls correctly by parsing the function name and its arguments and then executing the corresponding function.

Here's the corrected code for the `interpret_expression` function:

```python
def interpret_expression(self, expr, local_vars, allow_recursion):
    expr = expr.strip()

    if expr == '':  # Empty expression
        return None

    # Handle function calls
    m = re.match(
        r'(?P<func>%s)\((?P<args>.*)\)$' % _NAME_RE, expr)
    if m:
        fname = m.group('func')
        if fname not in self._functions:
            self._functions[fname] = self.extract_function(fname)
        argvals = tuple([
            int(v) if v.isdigit() else local_vars.get(v)
            for v in m.group('args').split(',') if v
        ])
        return self._functions[fname](argvals)

    # Handle other types of expressions
    # ...
```

In the corrected code, instead of trying to directly evaluate the function call within the existing logic, we first parse the function name and its arguments, then check if the function exists in the `_functions` dictionary. If it doesn't exist, we call the `extract_function` method, and then we call the function with the parsed arguments. This approach ensures that function calls are handled properly and the corresponding functions are executed correctly.
