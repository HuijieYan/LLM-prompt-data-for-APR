The potential error in the problematic function is the missing 'import re' statement. The use of regular expressions without importing the 're' module can cause the function to fail.

Approach for fixing the bug:
1. Import the 're' module at the beginning of the file to use regular expressions.
2. Add the necessary import statement at the start of the file.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
import re  # Add this import statement

class JSInterpreter(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def interpret_statement(self, stmt, local_vars, allow_recursion=100):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def interpret_expression(self, expr, local_vars, allow_recursion):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def extract_object(self, objname):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def extract_function(self, funcname):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # this is the correct and modified function
    def interpret_expression(self, expr, local_vars, allow_recursion):
        expr = expr.strip()
    
        if expr == '':  # Empty expression
            return None
        # ... remaining code as it is ...
```

In the corrected code, the 're' module has been imported at the beginning of the file, which enables the use of regular expressions within the problematic function.
