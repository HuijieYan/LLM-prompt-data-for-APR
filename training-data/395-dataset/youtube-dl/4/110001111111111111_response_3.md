The error occurs when the function `interpret_expression` is unable to handle the expression `x()`. This expression matches the pattern for a function call in the code, but the function is not properly extracted and executed, resulting in the unsupported expression error.

The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle the case where a function is called without any arguments.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to update the code to handle function calls without arguments. This can be achieved by checking if the function call has no arguments and directly calling the function without attempting to split the arguments.

Here's the corrected code for the `interpret_expression` function:

```python
def interpret_expression(self, expr, local_vars, allow_recursion):
    expr = expr.strip()

    # ... existing code ...

    m = re.match(
        r'(?P<var>%s)\((?P<args>[a-zA-Z0-9_$,]*)\)$' % _NAME_RE, expr)
    if m:
        fname = m.group('var')
        argvals = tuple([
            int(v) if v.isdigit() else local_vars.get(v, v)
            for v in m.group('args').split(',') if v.strip() != ''
        ])
        if fname not in self._functions:
            self._functions[fname] = self.extract_function(fname)
        return self._functions[fname](*argvals)

    # ... remaining code ...
```

In the updated code, a check has been added to handle function calls without arguments. The code ensures that an empty string is not included as an argument when splitting, and `local_vars.get(v, v)` is used to handle cases where the argument corresponds to a variable in `local_vars` or is a literal value.
