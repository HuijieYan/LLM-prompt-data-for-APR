The potential error in the code is that the `interpret_expression` method appears twice in the class `JSInterpreter`. This is not allowed in Python and causes a conflict.

The reason behind this bug is that a method with the same name is defined multiple times in the same Python class, which is not allowed and causes a conflict and ambiguity.

To fix this bug, the method `interpret_expression` needs to be defined only once in the class `JSInterpreter`.

Here's the corrected code for the `JSInterpreter` class with the `interpret_expression` method defined only once:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class JSInterpreter(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def interpret_statement(self, stmt, local_vars, allow_recursion=100):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def interpret_expression(self, expr, local_vars, allow_recursion=100):
        expr = expr.strip()
        # ... rest of the method ...

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def extract_object(self, objname):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def extract_function(self, funcname):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass
```

In this corrected code, the `interpret_expression` method is defined only once in the `JSInterpreter` class, and the `allow_recursion` parameter is also given a default value of 100.
