The bug seems to be occurring in the `interpret_expression` method of the `JSInterpreter` class. The error message states that it encountered an unsupported JS expression 'x()', which led to the `ExtractorError` being raised.

### Potential Error Location
The potential error occurs when the function tries to parse and interpret the expression 'x()', which is not handled correctly.

### Reasons behind the Bug
The bug occurs because the function does not handle function calls properly when they are part of an expression.

### Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug
1. Implement a proper mechanism for handling function calls within expressions.
2. Ensure that the method can correctly parse and interpret function calls with or without arguments.
3. Check for any missing or incorrect regular expressions that may lead to improper parsing of expressions.

### Corrected Code
```python
def interpret_expression(self, expr, local_vars, allow_recursion):
    # ... (existing code) ...

    # existing code that handles function calls
    m = re.match(
        r'^(?P<func>%s)\((?P<args>[a-zA-Z0-9_$,]+)\)$' % _NAME_RE, expr)
    if m:
        fname = m.group('func')
        argvals = tuple([
            int(v) if v.isdigit() else local_vars.get(v, v)
            for v in m.group('args').split(',')
        ])
        # updated code to handle unknown functions without raising an error
        if fname in self._functions:
            return self._functions[fname](*argvals)
        else:
            return '%s(%s)' % (fname, ', '.join(str(v) for v in argvals))

    # raising an ExtractorError for unsupported expressions at the end of the method
    raise ExtractorError('Unsupported JS expression %r' % expr)
```

The corrected code includes better handling of function calls within expressions and avoids raising an error for unknown functions. Instead, it returns a string representation of the function call. This should resolve the issue with unsupported JS expressions in the given test case.
