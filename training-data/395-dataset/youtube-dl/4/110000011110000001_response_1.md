This buggy function is used to interpret JavaScript expressions. The error message indicates that the function is unable to handle the expression 'x()', which is a function call.

The potential error location is in the section of code where it is trying to interpret the function call. The check for function calls seem to be incorrect, leading to the 'Unsupported JS expression' error.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function call is not being properly recognized and handled by the code.

One approach to fixing the bug is to update the regular expressions used to recognize function calls and correctly interpret them.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re
import json

# Corrected function
def interpret_expression(self, expr, local_vars, allow_recursion):
    expr = expr.strip()

    # ... (other existing code)

    m = re.match(
        r'^(?P<func>%s)\((?P<args>[^)]*)\)$' % _NAME_RE, expr)
    if m:
        fname = m.group('func')
        argvals = tuple([
            int(v) if v.isdigit() else local_vars[v]
            for v in m.group('args').split(',')])

        if fname in self._functions:
            return self._functions[fname](argvals)
        else:
            raise ExtractorError('Function %r is not defined' % fname)

    # ... (remaining existing code)

    raise ExtractorError('Unsupported JS expression %r' % expr)
```

In the corrected code, the regular expression for function calls has been updated to capture the function name and its arguments properly. It also includes a check to ensure that the function being called is defined in the `_functions` dictionary. If the function is not defined, it raises an error indicating that the function is not defined.
