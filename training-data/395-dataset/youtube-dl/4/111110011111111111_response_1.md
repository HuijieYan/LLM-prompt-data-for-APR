The bug in the `interpret_expression` method seems to occur due to the handling of function calls and unsupported JS expressions. It is failing to correctly interpret the expression 'x()' in the provided test case.

The reason behind the bug could be the improper handling of function calls and expressions within the method. It seems that the method is not able to properly identify and handle function calls and their arguments, leading to the Unsupported JS expression error.

To fix the bug, the `interpret_expression` method needs to be modified to effectively handle function calls and their arguments. This may involve refining the regular expressions used to parse function calls, ensuring proper handling of function arguments, and verifying the supported JS expressions.

Here's the corrected code for the `interpret_expression` method:

```python
def interpret_expression(self, expr, local_vars, allow_recursion):
    expr = expr.strip()

    if expr.isdigit():
        return int(expr)

    try:
        return json.loads(expr)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    m = re.match(
        r'(?P<var>%s)\((?P<args>.*)\)$' % _NAME_RE, expr)
    if m:
        variable = m.group('var')
        arg_str = m.group('args')

        if variable in self._functions:
            if arg_str:
                argvals = tuple([
                    int(v) if v.isdigit() else local_vars[v]
                    for v in arg_str.split(',')])
                return self._functions[variable](argvals)
            else:
                return self._functions[variable]()
        else:
            raise ExtractorError('Function %r is not defined' % variable)

    # Handle other types of expressions or unsupported ones
    raise ExtractorError('Unsupported JS expression %r' % expr)
```

In the corrected code:
1. We added a new regular expression pattern to handle function calls and their arguments.
2. We check if the function is defined in the `_functions` dictionary and then call it with the provided arguments if available.
3. In case the expression is not recognized as a function call or any other supported expression, an `ExtractorError` is raised.
