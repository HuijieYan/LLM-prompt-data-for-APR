The potential error in the code is the redefinition of the `interpret_expression` method in the `JSInterpreter` class. This method is being defined twice with the same name and different parameters, which causes a conflict and only the last defined method will be used.

This is likely a copy-paste error where the developer intended to create a new method but did not change the method signature.

To fix this issue, the developer should choose a different name for the second `interpret_expression` method or incorporate the functionality of the second method into the first method with appropriate parameter handling.

Corrected code:

```python
def interpret_expression(self, expr, local_vars, allow_recursion=100):
    expr = expr.strip()
    # ... (the rest of the function remains the same) ...
```
