Potential error location: 
The potential error in the code is when the `interpret_expression` method is called recursively. It is possible that the function `interpret_expression` is not updated with the correct parameters before calling it recursively, which can lead to incorrect behavior.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The function `interpret_expression` appears to recursively call itself with a modified `expr` parameter but without updating the `allow_recursion` parameter. This can lead to an incorrect count of recursion and potentially cause the function to hit the recursion limit prematurely or not hit it at all.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the `allow_recursion` parameter should be decremented before making any recursive calls to `interpret_expression`. Additionally, the function should handle the base case where `allow_recursion` reaches 0 to prevent further recursion.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def interpret_expression(self, expr, local_vars, allow_recursion):
        allow_recursion -= 1  # Decrement allow_recursion
        if allow_recursion < 0:  # Base case for recursion limit reached
            raise ValueError('Recursion limit reached')

        # Rest of the function code remains the same
```
