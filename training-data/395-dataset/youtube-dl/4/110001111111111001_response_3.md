The error occurs when the `interpret_expression` function encounters the expression 'x()'. It tries to match this expression with various patterns but fails to find a matching pattern and eventually raises an `ExtractorError` for encountering an unsupported JS expression. This is likely due to the fact that the function does not handle function calls in the expected manner.

To fix this bug:
1. We need to ensure that the function correctly handles function calls and their arguments.
2. Regression testing is essential to ensure that the changes made to the function do not introduce new bugs.

Here's the corrected code for the `interpret_expression` function:

```python
def interpret_expression(self, expr, local_vars, allow_recursion):
    expr = expr.strip()

    if expr == '':  # Empty expression
        return None

    # Function call handling
    m = re.match(
        r'(?P<func>%s)\((?P<args>.*)\)$' % _NAME_RE, expr)
    if m:
        fname = m.group('func')
        args = m.group('args').split(',')
        argvals = [self.interpret_expression(arg.strip(), local_vars, allow_recursion) for arg in args]
        if fname not in self._functions:
            self._functions[fname] = self.extract_function(fname)
        return self._functions[fname](argvals)

    # ... (other cases and patterns handling remain unchanged)
```

In this corrected code:
- We've added a new pattern to handle function calls, extracting the function name and its arguments.
- Then, we evaluate each argument using `interpret_expression` before invoking the function with the arguments.
- This should resolve the unsupported JS expression error and ensure that function calls are correctly handled.
