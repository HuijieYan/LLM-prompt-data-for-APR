Potential error location within the problematic function:
The error is occurring in the `interpret_expression` method of the `JSInterpreter` class. Specifically, the code is failing around the logic for handling function calls, especially when extracting the function name and its arguments.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The regular expression used for matching function calls might not be handling the function name and its arguments correctly, leading to the unsupported JS expression error.
2. The treatment of function calls and their arguments within the conditional blocks might not be comprehensive enough, causing the function calls to fail.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Review the regular expression used for matching function calls to ensure it accurately captures the function name and its arguments.
2. Refactor the logic for handling function calls to make it more robust, covering various scenarios such as different argument types, missing arguments, etc.
3. Check the approach for handling member access, function calls, and other expressions to ensure all possible cases are correctly addressed.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def interpret_expression(self, expr, local_vars, allow_recursion):
    expr = expr.strip()

    # ... other parts of the code ...

    m = re.match(
        r'(?P<func>%s)\((?P<args>.*)\)$' % _NAME_RE, expr)
    if m:
        fname = m.group('func')
        arg_str = m.group('args')
        
        if arg_str == '':
            argvals = tuple()
        else:
            argvals = tuple([
                int(v) if v.isdigit() else local_vars[v]
                for v in arg_str.split(',')])

        if fname not in self._functions:
            self._functions[fname] = self.extract_function(fname)
        return self._functions[fname](argvals)

    # ... remaining parts of the code ...
```

In the corrected code, the regular expression for matching function calls has been adjusted to capture the function name and its arguments correctly. Additionally, the logic for handling function calls and their arguments has been restructured to ensure comprehensive coverage of different scenarios.
