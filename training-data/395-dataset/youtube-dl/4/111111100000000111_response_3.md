The potential error in the `interpret_expression` function is that the second parameter `local_vars` is used without being checked if it's a valid variable (dictionary type). This could lead to errors if `local_vars` is not properly initialized or does not contain the expected values.

To fix the bug, we can add a check to ensure that `local_vars` is a dictionary type before using it in the function.

Here's the corrected code for the `interpret_expression` function:

```python
def interpret_expression(self, expr, local_vars, allow_recursion):
    if not isinstance(local_vars, dict):
        # handle the case when local_vars is not a dictionary as per the requirements
        raise ValueError('local_vars should be a dictionary')

    expr = expr.strip()
    # ... rest of the function code ...
    
    return result
```

Adding the check `if not isinstance(local_vars, dict):` ensures that the `local_vars` parameter is a dictionary and raises a ValueError if it's not, avoiding potential errors due to incorrect input.

It's important to handle the case when `local_vars` is not a dictionary to prevent unexpected behavior and potential errors in the function.
