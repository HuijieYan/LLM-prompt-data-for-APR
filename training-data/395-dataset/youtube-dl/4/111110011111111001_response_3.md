The error occurs in the `interpret_expression` method of the `JSInterpreter` class, specifically when it encounters the expression 'x()'. The function fails to handle this type of expression and raises an `ExtractorError` stating that the JS expression is unsupported.

The bug occurs because the function fails to properly handle function calls within expressions, specifically when the expression involves a function call like 'x()'. The current implementation of the function does not have a proper handling mechanism for function calls within expressions.

To fix this bug, we need to enhance the logic within the `interpret_expression` method to correctly handle function calls within expressions. We need to properly handle the case when a function is called and ensure that the function is invoked with the appropriate arguments and returns the correct result.

Below is the corrected code for the `interpret_expression` method:

```python
def interpret_expression(self, expr, local_vars, allow_recursion):
    # ... omitted code ...

    m = re.match(
        r'^(?P<func>%s)\((?P<args>[^()]*)\)$' % _NAME_RE, expr)
    if m:
        fname = m.group('func')
        argvals = m.group('args').split(',')
        argvals = [self.interpret_expression(v, local_vars, allow_recursion) for v in argvals]
        if fname not in self._functions:
            self._functions[fname] = self.extract_function(fname)
        return self._functions[fname](argvals)

    # ... omitted code ...
```

In this corrected implementation, we added a new block to handle function calls within expressions. It correctly parses the function name and its arguments, then calls the function with the evaluated arguments.

This updated implementation should resolve the bug and ensure that function calls within expressions are properly handled.
