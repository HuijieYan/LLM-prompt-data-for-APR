Based on the provided test cases, it seems that the `interpret_expression` function is not correctly handling the evaluation of expressions. The function needs to be able to correctly parse and evaluate the expressions provided, including handling function calls, mathematical operations, and variable assignments.

One potential error location within the function could be the parsing and evaluation of function calls, as well as mathematical operations and variable assignments.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be improper handling of function calls or mathematical operations within the expressions, leading to incorrect evaluation.

To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately parse the expressions and handle function calls, mathematical operations, and variable assignments according to the JavaScript syntax.

Here is the corrected code for the `interpret_expression` function:

```python
def interpret_expression(self, expr, local_vars, allow_recursion=100):
    expr = expr.strip()

    if expr == '':
        return None

    try:
        value = eval(expr, local_vars)
        return value
    except Exception as e:
        raise ExtractorError(f'Error evaluating expression {expr}: {e}')
```

In this corrected code, the `eval` built-in function is used to evaluate the expression, taking into account the provided variables in `local_vars`. Any errors in evaluating the expression will be caught and an `ExtractorError` will be raised with the specific error message.
