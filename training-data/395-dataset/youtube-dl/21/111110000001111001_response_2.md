The bug in the provided function `urljoin` is due to the incorrect use of type checking and the `re` module. The function is trying to check if the input base is a string, but it's checking it in an incorrect way. The function is also checking if the input path is a string, but it checks the wrong type using `compat_str`. 

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that we are checking the type of input parameters correctly and using the correct type for comparison.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def urljoin(base, path):
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not isinstance(base, str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return urljoin(base, path)
```

In the corrected function, we use `str` for type-checking instead of `compat_str`, and we use the `urljoin` function from the `urllib.parse` module for joining the base and path. This should fix the bugs in the original function.
