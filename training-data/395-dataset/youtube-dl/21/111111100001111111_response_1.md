The potential error location in the problematic function is the conditional statement `if not isinstance(base, compat_str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):`. This statement is causing issues with different variable types and input values.

The bug occurs due to incorrect type checking and handling of different types of input values for the `base` and `path` variables. The function should handle both string and bytes input types for base and path. It also needs to account for cases where `base` or `path` could be empty or invalid.

A possible approach to fix the bug is to use appropriate type checking and parsing for the `base` and `path` variables. Additionally, regular expressions should be used carefully to handle the URL join logic.

Here's the corrected code for the `urljoin` function:

```python
import re
from youtube_dl.compat import compat_str
from youtube_dl.compat import compat_urlparse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not isinstance(base, compat_str):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not base or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```

In the corrected code, we first convert the `base` to a string if it's of type `bytes` using the `decode('utf-8')` method. Then, we perform the necessary type checking and URL join logic to handle different input scenarios. This should resolve the issues and make the function more robust.
