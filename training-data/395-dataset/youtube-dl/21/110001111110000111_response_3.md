The error occurs when the function `urljoin` is called with a bytes object as the first argument and a string as the second argument. The function is not handling the bytes object properly, resulting in a None return value instead of the expected URL.

The bug is occurring because the function is not handling the case where the `base` argument is a bytes object. The function should handle both strings and bytes objects as input.

To fix the bug, the function should first check the type of the `base` argument and decode it to a string if it is a bytes object. Then, the function should use the decoded base for further processing.

Here's the corrected code for the `urljoin` function:

```python
import re
from youtube_dl.compat import compat_str
import youtube_dl.compat_urlparse as compat_urlparse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not isinstance(base, compat_str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```
