The bug in the code seems to be causing a crash when trying to download Twitch videos that are only available to subscribers. The error message indicates that an AttributeError is being raised because a 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'startswith'. This suggests that the function is returning None when it shouldn't be, leading to the crash.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional checks for base and path not being instances of compat_str. If these checks fail, the function returns None, which appears to be causing the crash in the specific test case provided.

The bug is occurring because the conditional checks for base and path not being instances of compat_str are incorrect. The checks are too strict and are causing the function to return None when it should be processing the base and path in a different way.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the conditional checks for base and path to handle different cases more accurately. Additionally, it may be necessary to handle the case where path is a relative URL and combine it with the base URL appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def urljoin(base, path):
    if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not isinstance(base, compat_str):
        return None
    if not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```
