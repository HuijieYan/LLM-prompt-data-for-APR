The potential error in the code is the incorrect import statement. The code is using `compat_str` and `compat_urlparse`, which are not standard Python modules. It seems like the code is trying to use compatibility libraries to support different Python versions, but the import statements are incorrect.

To fix the bug, the import statements should be corrected to use the appropriate standard Python modules. The function should also handle the case where `base` is `None` or not a string.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def urljoin(base, path):
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if base and isinstance(base, str) and re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return urljoin(base, path)
    return None
```
