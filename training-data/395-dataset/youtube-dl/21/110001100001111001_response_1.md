Potential error location: The potential error lies in the conditional statement checking the type of the 'path' and 'base' variables. The code currently checks if 'path' is not an instance of 'compat_str', which is not a standard Python type. Similarly, it checks if 'base' is not an instance of 'compat_str' and does not match a specific pattern.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the function is using an undefined type 'compat_str' instead of the standard Python type 'str'. Additionally, the code is not effectively handling the different types of inputs, such as bytes and strings, uniformly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Use the standard type 'str' instead of 'compat_str'.
2. Use type coercion to ensure consistent handling of input types.
3. Update the conditional statements to handle different input types effectively.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re
import six
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urljoin

def urljoin(base, path):
    if not isinstance(path, six.string_types) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not isinstance(base, six.string_types) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return urljoin(base, path)
```
This corrected code:
- Utilizes the standard Python 'str' type instead of 'compat_str'.
- Uses 'six.string_types' to handle both 'str' and 'bytes' types uniformly.
- Uses the 'urljoin' function from 'six.moves.urllib.parse' for URL joining.
