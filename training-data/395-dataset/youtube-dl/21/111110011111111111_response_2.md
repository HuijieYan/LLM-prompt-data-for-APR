**Analysis:**
The error message indicates that the function is returning `None` instead of the expected URL. This suggests that the function is not correctly handling the input parameters in some cases.

**Reasons behind the bug:**
The bug occurs because the function is not properly handling different types of input for the `base` and `path` parameters. It is also not properly checking for the validity of the input parameters.

**Potential approaches for fixing the bug:**
1. Check the type of the `base` and `path` parameters and ensure that they are both of type `str`.
2. Validate the input parameters to ensure that they are not empty or `None`.
3. Use proper URL parsing and joining methods to construct the output URL.

**Corrected code:**
```python
import re
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def urljoin(base, path):
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not isinstance(base, str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return urljoin(base, path)
```

The corrected code includes the following changes:
1. Imported the `urljoin` function from the `urllib.parse` module.
2. Corrected the type check for `path` and `base` parameters to ensure they are of type `str`.
3. Replaced the use of `compat_urlparse.urljoin` with the standard `urljoin` function.

These changes should resolve the issues with different types of input parameters and ensure that the function returns the correct URL.
