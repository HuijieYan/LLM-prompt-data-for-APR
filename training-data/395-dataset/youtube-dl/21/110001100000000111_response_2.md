Potential error location: The error message "AttributeError: 'NoneType' object has no attribute 'startswith'" suggests that the issue is occurring in the urljoin function at line 535 in the file utils.py.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug is likely happening because the urljoin function is returning a 'None' value in some cases, which is causing the AttributeError when the code tries to access the attribute 'startswith' on a NoneType object.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We can fix the bug by checking for 'None' values and handling them appropriately in the urljoin function to avoid the AttributeError.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def urljoin(base, path):
    if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not isinstance(base, compat_str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    joined_url = compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
    if joined_url:
        return joined_url
    else:
        return None
```
