The main issue with the provided function is that it assumes `base` and `path` are of type `compat_str`, which is not a standard Python type. It also uses the `re` module without importing it, and `compat_urlparse` is not a standard Python module.

The function is attempting to handle different cases involving URLs, but it's not doing so in a consistent and correct way.

To fix the function, we need to assume that `base` and `path` are always strings, and handle the different cases of path concatenation accordingly.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urljoin

def urljoin(base, path):
    # If path is empty, return base
    if not path:
        return base

    # If path is an absolute URL, return it
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path

    # If base is not a valid URL, return None
    parsed_base = urlparse(base)
    if not parsed_base.netloc:
        return None

    # Use urljoin to combine base and path
    return urljoin(base, path)
```

This corrected function properly checks for different scenarios and uses the `urlparse` and `urljoin` functions from the standard `urllib.parse` module to handle URL concatenation.
