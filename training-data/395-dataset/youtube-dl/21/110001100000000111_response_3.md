The bug in the `urljoin` function is likely causing the AttributeError mentioned in the GitHub issue. The AttributeError is likely due to the function returning `None` in some cases, which results in the subsequent `NoneType` error.

The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect handling of the `base` and `path` parameters. The function should only attempt to join the base and path if both parameters are strings and not empty, and if the path is not an absolute URL (i.e., it does not start with 'http' or 'https').

To fix the bug, we need to check if the `base` and `path` parameters are strings and not empty, and if the `path` is not an absolute URL before attempting to join them.

Here's the corrected code for the `urljoin` function:

```python
import re
from youtube_dl.compat import compat_str
from youtube_dl.compat import urlparse as compat_urlparse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if not isinstance(base, compat_str) or not base:
        return None
    if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```

With these changes, the function checks the type and emptiness of the `base` and `path` parameters before attempting to join them. This should prevent the AttributeError and resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
