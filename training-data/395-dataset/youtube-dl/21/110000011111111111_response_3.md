The error message indicates that the function is returning `None` instead of the expected URL. This suggests that the issue lies within the `urljoin` function.

The potential error in the code is that the `urljoin` function is not returning the expected URL for some input cases, resulting in a regression from a previous version of the software.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not handling the different types of input properly, leading to incorrect URL joining.

To fix the bug, the `urljoin` function needs to handle the different input types and cases properly, and return the correct joined URL.

Here's the corrected code for the `urljoin` function:

```python
import re
from urllib.parse import urljoin as urlparse_urljoin

def urljoin(base, path):
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not isinstance(base, str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return urlparse_urljoin(base, path)
```

With this corrected code, the `urljoin` function should handle the different input types and cases correctly, and return the expected joined URL.
