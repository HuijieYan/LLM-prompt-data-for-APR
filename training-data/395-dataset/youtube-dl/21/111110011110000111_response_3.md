The error message "AssertionError: None != 'http://foo.de/a/b/c.txt'" from the test function indicates that the urljoin function is returning None when it should be returning the joined URL.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the first if statement:
```python
if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
    return None
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is returning None when the path is not a string or is an empty string, which is incorrect behavior for the desired functionality.

To fix the bug, we can modify the condition in the first if statement to check if the path is not a string, and if it is an empty string, we should still proceed to joining it with the base URL. We also need to handle the possibility of the base URL being None.

Here's the corrected code for the urljoin function:

```python
import re
from six import string_types
import urllib.parse as urlparse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if path is None:
        return None
    if not isinstance(path, string_types):
        path = str(path)
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if base is not None and re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
    return None
```

This corrected code handles the case where the path is None or not a string, while also taking into account the base URL possibly being None.
