Potential error location: 

The potential error in the provided function is that it is checking if the `path` and `base` variables are of type `compat_str` before proceeding with further validations. However, `compat_str` is not defined in the code and this comparison will always fail. 

Reason behind the bug: 

The bug occurs because the code is attempting to check the type of the variables using an undefined type, `compat_str`.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: 

Instead of checking the type using `compat_str`, we can directly perform the string and regex validations on the `path` and `base` variables without considering their type.

Corrected code:

```python
import re
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def urljoin(base, path):
    if not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not base or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return urljoin(base, path)
```
