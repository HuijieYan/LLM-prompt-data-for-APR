Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the if statements checking for the type of `path` and `base`.

Reasons behind the bug: The `compat_str` type is not defined, and the `re` module is not imported. Additionally, there is an issue with the logic of the if statements.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Import the `re` module to use the `re.match` function.
2. Define the `compat_str` type or replace it with the built-in `str` type.
3. Modify the logic of the if statements to properly check the conditions.

Corrected code:
```python
import re
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def urljoin(base, path):
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not isinstance(base, str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return urljoin(base, path)
```
