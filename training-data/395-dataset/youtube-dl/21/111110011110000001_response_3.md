The error message is indicating that the urljoin function is returning None instead of the expected URL. This suggests that the function is not handling the input correctly, resulting in a None return value.

The potential error location within the function is the first conditional check:
```python
if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
    return None
```

This conditional check is returning None if the path is not an instance of compat_str or if it is empty. However, in the test case `self.assertEqual(urljoin(b'http://foo.de/', '/a/b/c.txt'), 'http://foo.de/a/b/c.txt')`, the path is not an instance of compat_str, so the function returns None instead of handling the input correctly.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle byte strings, strings, and empty input paths correctly.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def urljoin(base, path):
    if path is None or base is None:
        return None
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not base.startswith(('http://', 'https://')):
        base = 'http://' + base
    return urllib.parse.urljoin(base, path)
```

This corrected code checks for None input and decodes byte strings to utf-8 before processing them using the urllib.parse.urljoin function. Additionally, it ensures that the base URL includes 'http://' or 'https://' before using urllib.parse.urljoin.
