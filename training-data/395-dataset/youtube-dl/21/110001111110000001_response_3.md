The test case is trying to join a base URL with a path, where the base URL is provided in bytes format. The error message indicates that the function is returning `None` instead of the expected joined URL.

The potential error location is in the condition `if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:` in the `urljoin` function. This condition checks if the `path` is not an instance of `compat_str` or if `path` is empty, then it returns `None`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the condition is incorrectly checking the type of `path` and returning `None` if it is not of type `compat_str`. This is causing the function to return `None` instead of joining the base URL with the path.

To fix the bug, the condition needs to be modified to handle the case where the base URL is provided in bytes format. It should also handle the case where the path is provided as bytes. Additionally, the function should check if the base URL is not `None` before attempting to join it with the path.

Here's the corrected code for the `urljoin` function:

```python
from youtube_dl.compat import compat_str
import re
from youtube_dl.compat import urlparse as compat_urlparse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if path is None:
        return None
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
        
    if not path:  # If path is empty after decoding, return None
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not isinstance(base, compat_str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle the case where the base URL and path are provided as bytes and return the joined URL accordingly.
