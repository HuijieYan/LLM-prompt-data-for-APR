Potential Error Location: The error is likely occurring in the urljoin function of the utils.py file.

Reasons behind Occurrence of the Bug: 
The error message indicates an AttributeError related to the 'NoneType' object, which suggests that the urljoin function is returning None in some cases instead of the expected URL.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the inputs: Ensure that the base and path parameters are valid strings before processing them.
2. Handle edge cases: If the base or path is not in the expected format, return None to avoid errors.
3. Use regular expressions carefully: Verify that the regular expressions used for matching URLs are functioning as expected.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:

```python
import re
from youtube_dl.utils import compat_str, compat_urlparse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if not isinstance(base, compat_str) or not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```
This corrected code checks if the base and path parameters are valid strings before processing them. It also handles the case where the path already represents a complete URL and returns it directly. Additionally, it ensures that the base is in the expected format before using it in the urljoin operation.
