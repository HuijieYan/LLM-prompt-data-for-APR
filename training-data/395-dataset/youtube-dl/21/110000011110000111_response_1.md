Potential error location: The bug seems to be occurring in the `urljoin` function due to the assertion error in the test case.

Reasons for the bug:
- The `urljoin` function is returning `None` in some cases, even though it should be returning the joined URL.
- The current `urljoin` function does not handle the base URL being `bytes` type properly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Check if the `base` parameter is a `bytes` type, and if so, decode it to `str` type.
- Modify the `urljoin` function to handle both `str` and `bytes` types for the `base` parameter.
- Update the function to return the correct joined URL instead of `None`.

Corrected code for the `urljoin` function:
```python
import re
from six import text_type, binary_type
from youtube_dl.compat import compat_urlparse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if not isinstance(path, text_type) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not isinstance(base, text_type) and not isinstance(base, binary_type):
        return None
    if isinstance(base, binary_type):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```
