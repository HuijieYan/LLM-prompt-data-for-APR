Potential error location: The conditional statement `if not isinstance(base, compat_str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):` is incorrect.

Reasons for the bug:
1. The `if not isinstance(base, compat_str)` condition is invalid because `compat_str` is not defined and should likely be replaced with `str`.
2. The `or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base)` condition is also incorrect as it is checking if `base` does not match the regex pattern, which is not the intended logic.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Replace `compat_str` with `str` and `compat_urlparse` with `urllib.parse`.
2. Remove the unnecessary conditional check for `base` matching the regex pattern.

Corrected code:

```python
import re
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urljoin

def urljoin(base, path):
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    return urljoin(base, path)
```
