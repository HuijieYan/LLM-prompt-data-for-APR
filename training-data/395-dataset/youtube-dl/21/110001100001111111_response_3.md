The bug occurs because the function `urljoin` is not handling the different types of inputs properly. It requires both `base` and `path` to be of type `str` and is not handling bytes inputs correctly.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that both `base` and `path` are properly converted to strings if they are bytes. We can use the `decode` method to convert bytes to strings.

Here's the corrected code for the `urljoin` function:

```python
import re
from youtube_dl.compat import compat_urlparse, compat_str

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not isinstance(base, compat_str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```
