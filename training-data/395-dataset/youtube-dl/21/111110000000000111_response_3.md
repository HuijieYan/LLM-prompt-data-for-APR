The bug in the provided function is due to the incorrect handling of the base and path parameters. The condition checks for the base URL and the path URL are not correctly implemented, leading to the function returning None in some cases where it shouldn't.

To fix the bug, you can modify the function as follows:

```python
import re
from urllib.parse import urljoin

# this is the fixed function
def urljoin(base, path):
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not isinstance(base, str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return urljoin(base, path)
```

In the fixed function:
1. `compat_str` has been replaced with `str`, which is the standard way to check if a variable is a string in Python.
2. Instead of using `compat_urlparse.urljoin`, the standard library function `urljoin` from `urllib.parse` has been used.

This should resolve the bug and allow the function to work as intended.
