The buggy function `urljoin` is intended to join a base URL with a relative path, but it has multiple issues. It incorrectly uses the `compat_str` type, which is not a standard Python type and reuses the function name. Additionally, it doesn't handle various cases properly, such as when base path is empty or when path contains the protocol (http or https).

To fix these issues, check for the correct string type using `isinstance`, handle cases where the base path may be empty, and properly handle path containing the protocol.

Below is the corrected `urljoin` function:

```python
import re
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urljoin

def urljoin(base, path):
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not isinstance(base, str):
        return None
    parsed = urlparse(base)
    if not parsed.scheme and not parsed.netloc:
        return None
    return urljoin(base, path)
```

This function first checks if the input path is a non-empty string. If it's not, it returns None. Then it checks if the input path contains the protocol and returns the path if it does. Next, it checks if the base path is a valid string with a scheme and netloc (domain) and returns None if it's not. Finally, it uses Python's built-in `urljoin` to join the base URL and the path.
