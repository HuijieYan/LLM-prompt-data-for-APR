Potential error location: The if statements that check if the variables are instances of `compat_str` and if `path` matches a specific pattern, as well as the if statement that checks if `base` is an instance of `compat_str` and if it matches a specific pattern, might be causing the issue.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug might be occurring because the if statements are not correctly handling the different types of input and patterns. This could lead to unexpected behavior and the function returning None incorrectly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We can modify the if statements to properly handle the different types of input and patterns. Also, checking for the `None` type before calling methods on the variables, is essential. Additionally, we can use the `urllib.parse.urljoin` function to correctly join the base and path.

Corrected code:

```python
import re
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urljoin

def urljoin(base, path):
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not isinstance(base, str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return urljoin(base, path)
```
