The error occurs because the function `urljoin` returns `None` instead of the expected URL in some cases.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle all possible input types properly. 

To fix the bug, the function should first check the type of the `base` and `path` parameters. If `base` is `None`, it should return `path` directly. If `path` is an absolute URL, it should return `path` directly. If `path` is a relative URL, it should properly join it with `base` using `urlparse.urljoin`.

Here's the corrected code for the `urljoin` function:

```python
import re
from .compat import (
    compat_str,
    urlparse,
)

def urljoin(base, path):
    if base is None:
        return path
    if isinstance(base, compat_str) and isinstance(path, compat_str):
        if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
            return path
        else:
            return urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
    else:
        return None
```

This corrected code checks for `None` base and properly handles the different types of input for `base` and `path`. This should resolve the issue and make the `urljoin` function work as expected.
