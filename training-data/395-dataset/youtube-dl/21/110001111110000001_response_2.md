The error occurs when the `urljoin` function is called with a base URL provided as bytes (`b'http://foo.de/'`). The function is returning `None` instead of the expected joined URL.

The potential error in the `urljoin` function is the check `if not isinstance(base, compat_str)`. Since the base URL is provided as bytes in the test case, this condition is true and the function returns `None`.

The bug occurred because the function was not designed to handle the base URL provided as bytes. A possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the condition to handle both `str` and `bytes` types for the base URL.

Here's the corrected code for the `urljoin` function:

```python
from youtube_dl.utils import compat_str, compat_urlparse
import re

def urljoin(base, path):
    if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if (isinstance(base, compat_str) or isinstance(base, bytes)) and (not isinstance(base, compat_str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base.decode('utf-8'))):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```

This corrected code includes additional checks to handle the base URL provided as bytes by using `isinstance(base, bytes)` and then decoding it to utf-8 for the match condition. Now, the function should be able to handle both `str` and `bytes` types for the base URL.
