The issue seems to be related to the urljoin function in the youtube_dl/utils.py file. The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError in sanitize_url, which is likely caused by the urljoin function returning None when it should not.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the conditional checks at the beginning of the function. The checks for isinstance and re.match are not properly handling the input parameters.

The bug occurs because the conditional checks for isinstance and re.match are not properly verifying the input parameters. This causes the function to return None when it shouldn't, leading to the AttributeError in the calling function.

To fix the bug, the conditional checks should be modified to properly handle the input parameters and ensure that the function proceeds with the correct logic.

Here's the corrected code for the urljoin function:

```python
import re
from youtube_dl.compat import compat_str
from youtube_dl.compat import compat_urllib_parse as compat_urlparse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not isinstance(base, compat_str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```
