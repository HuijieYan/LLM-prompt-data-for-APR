The bug in the `urljoin` function is causing the AssertionError in the test case. The function is not handling the input properly, leading to incorrect outputs.

The potential error is in the conditional statements of the `urljoin` function. The function checks if `path` is an instance of `compat_str` and is not empty, but it does not handle the case where `base` is not a valid instance of `compat_str` or is empty. This causes the function to return `None` in some cases where it should not.

The `urljoin` function should be updated to fix the conditional statements and handle the cases where `base` is not a valid instance of `compat_str` or is empty.

Here's the corrected code for the `urljoin` function:

```python
import re
from youtube_dl.compat import compat_str, compat_urlparse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not isinstance(base, compat_str) or not base or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```
