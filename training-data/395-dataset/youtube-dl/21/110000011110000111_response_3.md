The error occurs when trying to join the base URL with the path. The current function does not handle the case where the base URL is a byte string (defined as `b'http://foo.de/'`). This causes the function to return `None` instead of the expected joined URL.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `urljoin` function to handle both string and byte string inputs for the base URL. This can be done by converting the base URL to a string if it is a byte string before performing join operation.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re
from six import string_types
from urllib.parse import urljoin as compat_urljoin

def urljoin(base, path):
    if not isinstance(path, string_types) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, string_types) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```

With this modification, the function can handle both string and byte string inputs for the base URL, and perform the URL join operation without returning `None`.

The provided GitHub issue is related to the youtube-dl project and doesn't directly reference the `urljoin` function. However, the fix for the `urljoin` function could potentially resolve issues related to URL handling in the youtube-dl project.
