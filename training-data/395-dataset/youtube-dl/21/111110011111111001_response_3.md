The error message indicates that the buggy function is returning `None` instead of the expected URL for the given input parameters.

The potential error location within the function is the conditional statements that check the type of `base` and `path`.

The bug occurs because the function is checking if `path` is an instance of `compat_str` and not an empty string, but in some cases, it should be checking if `path` is an instance of `bytes` instead.

To fix the bug, we should modify the conditional statements to properly handle the different data types for `base` and `path`.

Here's the corrected code for the `urljoin` function:

```python
import re
from six import binary_type, text_type
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urljoin as urlparse_urljoin

def urljoin(base, path):
    if not isinstance(path, (str, binary_type)) or not path:
        return None
    if isinstance(path, binary_type):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not isinstance(base, (str, binary_type)) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    if isinstance(base, binary_type):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    return urlparse_urljoin(base, path)
```

In the corrected code:
- The `six` library is used to handle differences between Python 2 and 3 for string types.
- The `isinstance` checks have been updated to handle both `str` and `bytes`.
- If `path` is of type `bytes`, it is decoded to `utf-8`.
- Similarly, if `base` is of type `bytes`, it is decoded to `utf-8`.
- Finally, the `urlparse_urljoin` function is used to perform the URL joining.

This should fix the bug and make the function work as expected for the given test cases.
