The problem in the `urljoin` function is that it's not handling the base URL correctly when it's in bytes format. This causes the function to return None instead of the expected URL.

The function currently checks if the path and base are instances of `compat_str` (which I assume is a custom string type in the youtube-dl codebase) and if the path is not empty. If both conditions are met, it proceeds to check if the path is an absolute URL (starts with 'http' or 'https'). If not, it then checks if the base URL is a valid absolute URL. If this is also true, it uses the `compat_urlparse.urljoin` method to join the base and path.

The bug occurs when the base URL is in bytes format. The function does not account for this and tries to match the base URL using `re.match()` against a pattern, which fails because the base URL is in bytes format.

To fix this bug, we need to handle base URLs in bytes format correctly and modify the regex match for checking absolute URLs to handle both str and bytes types.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from youtube_dl.compat import (
    compat_str,
    compat_urlparse,
    compat_urllib_request,
)

def urljoin(base, path):
    if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
        return None
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if re.match(br'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, compat_str) and re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
    return None
```

This function includes a check to see if the base URL is in bytes format, and if so, it decodes it to a utf-8 string before further processing. Additionally, the regex pattern to match absolute URLs now caters to both str and bytes types.
