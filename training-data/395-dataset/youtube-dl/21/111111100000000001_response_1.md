Potential error location: The potential error location is within the `urljoin` function where the condition `if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:` is checking if the `path` is not an instance of `compat_str` or if it's empty, in which case it returns `None`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the condition checks if `path` is not an instance of `compat_str` instead of checking if it is an instance of `compat_str`. And if the path is not an instance of `compat_str` or empty, it returns `None`, which may not be the correct behavior.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if `path` is an instance of `compat_str` instead of not being an instance, and also check if it's not empty.
2. Use a better approach for handling the condition where `base` is not an instance of `compat_str` or if it doesn't match the URL pattern, such as raising an exception.

Corrected code:

```python
import re

# this is the corrected function
def urljoin(base, path):
    if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not isinstance(base, compat_str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        raise ValueError("Base is not a valid URL")
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```
