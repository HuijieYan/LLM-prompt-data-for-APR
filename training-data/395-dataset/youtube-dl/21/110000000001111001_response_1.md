Potential Error location: The if condition `if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):` is causing the issue.

Reason for the bug: The condition `if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):` is used to check if the path is an absolute URL. However, the regular expression used here does not correctly identify an absolute URL in all cases. 

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Use a more comprehensive regular expression to identify an absolute URL, and also handle the cases for base being None, empty, or not a string.

```python
import re
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def urljoin(base, path):
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:[a-zA-Z][\w-]+:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not isinstance(base, str) or base.strip() == '':
        return None
    return urljoin(base, path)
```
