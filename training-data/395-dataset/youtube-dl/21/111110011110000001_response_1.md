Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the conversion of the base URL to bytes in the test case `self.assertEqual(urljoin(b'http://foo.de/', '/a/b/c.txt'), 'http://foo.de/a/b/c.txt')`, which results in the incorrect output of `None` instead of the expected URL.

Reasons for the bug:
The bug occurs because the function `urljoin` checks if the base URL is an instance of `compat_str` and also if it starts with `https?://`. However, the function does not handle the case where the base URL is provided as bytes. This leads to the incorrect result of `None` being returned instead of the expected URL.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the function to handle the case where the base URL is provided as bytes by converting it to a string before performing the checks.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import re
from urllib.parse import urljoin as urlparse_urljoin

def urljoin(base, path):
    if not isinstance(base, str):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return urlparse_urljoin(base, path)
```
