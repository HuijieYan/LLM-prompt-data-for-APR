The error message is indicating that the test case is failing at the assertion that `res` should be `['1']`, but it is actually `[]`. This suggests that the `match_filter_func` is not correctly filtering the videos based on the conditions provided.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `_match_one` function, which seems to be responsible for parsing and matching the filter conditions.

The bug seems to be happening because the comparison logic in the `_match_one` function is not correctly evaluating the filter conditions provided, leading to incorrect filtering of the videos.

To fix the bug, the logic for parsing and evaluating the filter conditions needs to be carefully reviewed and corrected. This may involve issues with the comparison operators or the actual comparison logic.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import operator
import re

def parse_filesize(s):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def _match_one(filter_part, dct):
    comparison_value = None
    if '<' in filter_part:
        key, value = filter_part.split('<')
        comparison_value = value.strip()
        return dct.get(key) < comparison_value
    elif '<=' in filter_part:
        key, value = filter_part.split('<=')
        comparison_value = value.strip()
        return dct.get(key) <= comparison_value
    elif '>' in filter_part:
        key, value = filter_part.split('>')
        comparison_value = value.strip()
        return dct.get(key) > comparison_value
    elif '>=' in filter_part:
        key, value = filter_part.split('>=')
        comparison_value = value.strip()
        return dct.get(key) >= comparison_value
    elif '=' in filter_part:
        key, value = filter_part.split('=')
        comparison_value = value.strip()
        return dct.get(key) == comparison_value
    elif '!=' in filter_part:
        key, value = filter_part.split('!=')
        comparison_value = value.strip()
        return dct.get(key) != comparison_value
    else:
        raise ValueError('Invalid filter part %r' % filter_part)
```

This corrected code provides a simple and direct approach to parsing and evaluating the filter conditions. It splits the filter_part and compares the values accordingly, ensuring that the comparison logic is correctly applied.
