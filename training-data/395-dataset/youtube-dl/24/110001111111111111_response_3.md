The bug is likely occurring in the `_match_one` function, specifically in the part where it checks for the presence of a 'none_inclusive' group. The function seems to be returning the value of 'none_inclusive' instead of the actual comparison result.

The bug occurs because the function is not handling the 'none_inclusive' case properly and returning it instead of the comparison result. This leads to incorrect comparison results and the failure of the test case.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function handles the 'none_inclusive' case correctly and returns the comparison result as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the `_match_one` function:

```python
def _match_one(filter_part, dct):
    # ... existing code ...

    m = operator_rex.search(filter_part)
    if m:
        # ... existing code ...

        if m.group('none_inclusive') is not None:
            actual_value = dct.get(m.group('key'))
            if actual_value is None:
                return m.group('none_inclusive')  # Return the none_inclusive value if actual_value is None

        return op(actual_value, comparison_value)  # Return the comparison result

    # ... existing code ...
```

By properly handling the 'none_inclusive' case and returning the comparison result as expected, the bug should be fixed.

Please replace the existing `_match_one` function with the corrected code provided above. After making this change, re-run the test case to ensure that the bug is indeed fixed.
