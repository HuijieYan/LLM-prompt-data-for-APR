The bug seems to be related to the usage of the `--match-filter` option for comparing the `playlist_id`, which is always being skipped.

Potential error location: The `_match_one` function seems to be the source of the bug, as it is responsible for parsing and matching the filter parts.

Reasons behind the bug:
1. The regular expressions used for parsing the comparison and unary operations might not be handling the filter part for `playlist_id` correctly.
2. The comparison and unary operators might not be handling the `playlist_id` in the expected way, leading to it being skipped.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Review and update the regular expressions to handle the `playlist_id` filter part correctly.
2. Ensure that the comparison and unary operators handle the `playlist_id` as expected.

Corrected code for the `_match_one` function:
```python
import operator
import re

def _match_one(filter_part, dct):
    # existing code

    # Modify the regular expression to correctly handle playlist_id
    operator_rex = re.compile(r'''(?x)\s*
        (?P<key>[a-z_]+)
        \s*(?P<op>%s)(?P<none_inclusive>\s*\?)?\s*
        (?:
            (?P<intval>[0-9.]+(?:[kKmMgGtTpPeEzZyY]i?[Bb]?)?)|
            (?P<strval>(?![0-9.])[a-z0-9A-Z]*)
            |(?P<playlist_id>[a-z_0-9]+)  # New group for playlist_id
        )
        \s*$
        ''' % '|'.join(map(re.escape, COMPARISON_OPERATORS.keys())))

    # existing code

    if m:
        # existing code
        if m.group('playlist_id') is not None:
            comparison_value = m.group('playlist_id')
            actual_value = dct.get(m.group('key'))
            if actual_value is None:
                return m.group('none_inclusive')
            return op(actual_value, comparison_value)

    # existing code

    # existing code
```

This corrected code introduces a new group in the regular expression to capture the `playlist_id` and handles it separately in the comparison operation. Additionally, the handling of `playlist_id` in the `comparison_value` and the comparison itself has been adjusted.
