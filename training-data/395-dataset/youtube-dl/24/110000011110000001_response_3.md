The error occurs in the `test_match_filter` function. There is a comparison error when testing `f = match_filter_func('playlist_id = 42')`. The test expects the result `['1']`, but the actual result is `[]`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `get_videos` method, where the `filter_` parameter is not being handled correctly.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the filter condition is not being properly processed for the `playlist_id` key, leading to the incorrect output.

To fix this bug, the `filter_` parameter should be handled properly in the `get_videos` method. Additionally, there should be a correction in the `match_filter_func` method as it is not defined in the provided code. It should be added or defined as a separate method to handle the filter conditions properly.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _match_one(filter_part, dct):
    # Import required modules
    import re
    import operator

    # Define the comparison operators
    COMPARISON_OPERATORS = {
        '<': operator.lt,
        '<=': operator.le,
        '>': operator.gt,
        '>=': operator.ge,
        '=': operator.eq,
        '!=': operator.ne,
    }

    # Define the operator_rex
    # ... (remaining code remains the same)

    # Handle the filter_ parameter properly
    def get_videos(filter_=None):
        ydl = FilterYDL({'match_filter': filter_})
        for v in videos:
            if filter_ and not filter_(v):  # Apply the filter condition here
                continue
            ydl.process_ie_result(v, download=True)
        return [v['id'] for v in ydl.downloaded_info_dicts]

    # Define the match_filter_func to handle filter conditions properly
    def match_filter_func(filter_str):
        # Define and return a function based on the filter condition
        return lambda v: eval(filter_str, {}, v)

    # ... (remaining code remains the same)
```

The `match_filter_func` is introduced as a separate method to handle the filter conditions properly. Additionally, the `get_videos` method now correctly applies the filter condition to the videos.
