The error in the code seems to be related to the `_match_one` function, which is not handling the comparison and matching properly. The function seems to have issues with comparing the values and filtering the results based on the provided filter_part. This is leading to incorrect results in the test cases.

The reason behind the bug is that the comparison and filtering logic inside the `_match_one` function is not correctly handling the filter_part and performing the comparisons with the values in the dct dictionary.

To fix the bug, the `_match_one` function needs to be revised to properly handle the comparison operators and values in the filter_part. Additionally, it needs to correctly compare the values with the provided dictionary and return the expected results based on the comparisons.

Here is the corrected code for the `_match_one` function:

```python
import operator
import re


def parse_filesize(s):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass


def _match_one(filter_part, dct):
    COMPARISON_OPERATORS = {
        '<': operator.lt,
        '<=': operator.le,
        '>': operator.gt,
        '>=': operator.ge,
        '=': operator.eq,
        '!=': operator.ne,
    }
    
    parts = re.split(r'([<>=!]+)', filter_part)
    key = parts[0].strip()
    op = parts[1].strip()
    comparison_value = parts[2].strip()

    if op not in COMPARISON_OPERATORS:
        raise ValueError('Invalid comparison operator: %s' % op)

    if comparison_value.isdigit():
        comparison_value = int(comparison_value)
    elif comparison_value.endswith('B'):
        comparison_value = parse_filesize(comparison_value)
    else:
        comparison_value = comparison_value.strip()

    actual_value = dct.get(key)
    if actual_value is None:
        return False

    comparison_func = COMPARISON_OPERATORS[op]
    return comparison_func(actual_value, comparison_value)
```

With this corrected function, the comparison and filtering logic is more appropriately handled, and it should produce the expected results for the test cases.
