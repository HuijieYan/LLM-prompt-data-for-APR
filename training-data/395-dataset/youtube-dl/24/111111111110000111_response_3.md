The error message indicates that the test is failing on the assertion `self.assertEqual(res, ['1'])`. This suggests that the issue might be related to the comparison of the `playlist_id` in the `match_filter` function, which is causing videos with `playlist_id` 42 to be skipped.

The potential error location within the `_match_one` function is likely in the block of code that handles the comparison with the `playlist_id`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be that the comparison for the `playlist_id` is not being handled correctly in the `_match_one` function, causing the videos with `playlist_id` 42 to be skipped erroneously.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the comparison for the `playlist_id` is correctly implemented in the `_match_one` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `_match_one` function:

```python
import operator
import re

def parse_filesize(s):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def _match_one(filter_part, dct):
    COMPARISON_OPERATORS = {
        '<': operator.lt,
        '<=': operator.le,
        '>': operator.gt,
        '>=': operator.ge,
        '=': operator.eq,
        '!=': operator.ne,
    }

    key, op, comparison_value = re.match(r'(\w+)\s*([<>=!]=?)\??\s*([^ ]+)?', filter_part).groups()
    actual_value = dct.get(key)
    
    if actual_value is None:
        return False
    elif not comparison_value:
        return True
    elif comparison_value.isdigit():
        comparison_value = int(comparison_value)
    elif comparison_value[-2:].lower() == 'kb':
        comparison_value = parse_filesize(comparison_value)
    else:
        raise ValueError(f"Invalid comparison value {comparison_value} in filter part {filter_part}")

    return COMPARISON_OPERATORS[op](actual_value, comparison_value)
```

In the corrected code, we first extract the key, operator, and comparison value from the filter part using the regular expression. Then, we retrieve the actual value from the dictionary and perform the comparison based on the operator.

This should address the issue with comparing the `playlist_id` and ensure that the test case `self.assertEqual(res, ['1'])` passes correctly.
