The error in the provided code is likely occurring in the `_match_one` function, specifically in the block of code that handles the comparison between values. The bug seems to be leading to the incorrect filtering of videos, as evidenced by the error message in the test function.

Upon analysis, it seems that the issue stems from the comparison operation being incorrectly applied, leading to incorrect filtering of videos. This is likely the reason for the mismatch in the expected and actual results in the test function.

To fix the bug, the comparison operation in the `_match_one` function should be carefully reviewed and corrected to ensure proper filtering of videos based on the given filter conditions.

Below is the corrected code for the `_match_one` function:

```python
import operator
import re

def _match_one(filter_part, dct):
    COMPARISON_OPERATORS = {
        '<': operator.lt,
        '<=': operator.le,
        '>': operator.gt,
        '>=': operator.ge,
        '=': operator.eq,
        '!=': operator.ne,
    }
    
    m = re.match(r'([a-z_]+)\s*([<>!=]+)\s*([^?]+)\s*(\?|)',
                 filter_part.strip())
    
    if not m:
        raise ValueError('Invalid filter part %r' % filter_part)
    
    key = m.group(1)
    op = m.group(2)
    value = m.group(3)
    none_inclusive = m.group(4)
    
    if value.isdigit():
        comparison_value = int(value)
    else:
        comparison_value = value
    
    actual_value = dct.get(key)
    
    if actual_value is None:
        return none_inclusive
    
    return COMPARISON_OPERATORS[op](actual_value, comparison_value)
```

This corrected code uses a regular expression to extract the key, comparison operator, value, and none_inclusive flag from the filter_part string. It then performs the comparison operation and returns the result accordingly. This should address the issue and ensure proper filtering of videos based on the given filter conditions.
