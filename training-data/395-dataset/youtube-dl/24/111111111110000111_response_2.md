The error message indicates that the `playlist_id` filter is always being skipped, leading to incorrect results in the test case. This suggests that there is a problem with the `_match_one` function in the `utils.py` file.

The potential error location is within the `_match_one` function, particularly in the section that handles the `playlist_id` filter.

The bug occurred because the comparison for `playlist_id` was not being handled correctly in the `_match_one` function. This led to the filter being skipped and causing incorrect results in the test case.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to specifically handle the `playlist_id` comparison in the `_match_one` function to ensure that it is being evaluated properly.

The corrected code for the `_match_one` function in `utils.py` is as follows:

```python
def _match_one(filter_part, dct):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged) ...

    if m.group('key') == 'playlist_id':
        op = COMPARISON_OPERATORS[m.group('op')]
        comparison_value = m.group('intval') or m.group('strval')
        actual_value = dct.get('playlist_id')
        if actual_value is None:
            return m.group('none_inclusive')
        return op(actual_value, comparison_value)

    # ... (other code remains unchanged) ...
```

In the corrected code, we specifically handle the `playlist_id` comparison and ensure that it is evaluated correctly. This should resolve the issue with the `playlist_id` filter being skipped in the test case.
