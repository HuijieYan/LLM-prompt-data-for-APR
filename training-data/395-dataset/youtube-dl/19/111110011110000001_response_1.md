The test case calls the `prepare_filename` method of the `YoutubeDL` class with different templates and info dictionaries, and then checks the output against expected values.

The error message indicates that the output is not as expected for the input template `'Hello %(title1)s'`. Instead of `'Hello $PATH'`, the output is some long path. This suggests that the `prepare_filename` method is not correctly parsing the template and substituting the values from the `info_dict`.

Looking at the code, we can see that the issue lies in the `sanitize` function, which is used to sanitize the filename. This function is not correctly handling the cases where the input value contains special characters like `$` and `%`. As a result, the substitution of `%(title1)s` with `'$PATH'` is not being handled appropriately.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `sanitize` function to handle special characters properly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `prepare_filename`:

```python
def prepare_filename(self, info_dict):
    """Generate the output filename."""
    try:
        # Existing code

        sanitize = lambda k, v: re.sub(r'[\\/:*?"<>|]', '', compat_str(v))  # Update the sanitize function
        template_dict = dict((k, v if isinstance(v, compat_numeric_types) else sanitize(k, v))
                             for k, v in template_dict.items()
                             if v is not None and not isinstance(v, (list, tuple, dict)))
        
        # Rest of the code remains the same

        filename = expand_path(outtmpl % template_dict)
        if sys.version_info < (3, 0) and sys.platform == 'win32':
            filename = encodeFilename(filename, True).decode(preferredencoding())
        return sanitize_path(filename)
    except ValueError as err:
        self.report_error('Error in output template: ' + str(err) + ' (encoding: ' + repr(preferredencoding()) + ')')
        return None
```

In the corrected code, the `sanitize` function has been updated to use a regular expression to remove special characters from the string. This should ensure that the values are correctly substituted into the template when generating the output filename.
