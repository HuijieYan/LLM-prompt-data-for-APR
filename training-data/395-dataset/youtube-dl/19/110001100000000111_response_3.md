The error occurs in the `prepare_filename` function of the `YoutubeDL.py` file. The function tries to generate the output filename from the input info_dict, but there are potential issues with formatting and encoding.

The bug seems to be related to the handling of the output filename when it contains the `$PATH` string. This can cause issues with encoding and subprocess operations, particularly on Windows.

To fix the bug, the function should handle the `$PATH` string properly and ensure that it does not interfere with the filename generation process.

Here's the corrected code for the `prepare_filename` function:

```python
def prepare_filename(self, info_dict):
    """Generate the output filename."""
    try:
        # ... (previous code remains the same) ...

        outtmpl = self.params.get('outtmpl', DEFAULT_OUTTMPL)

        # handle $PATH string properly in the output template
        if '$PATH' in outtmpl:
            outtmpl = outtmpl.replace('$PATH', 'PATH')  # replace $PATH with PATH

        # ... (remaining code remains the same) ...

        filename = expand_path(outtmpl % template_dict)
        # Temporary fix for #4787
        # 'Treat' all problem characters by passing filename through preferredencoding
        # to workaround encoding issues with subprocess on python2 @ Windows
        if sys.version_info < (3, 0) and sys.platform == 'win32':
            filename = encodeFilename(filename, True).decode(preferredencoding())
        return sanitize_path(filename)
    except ValueError as err:
        self.report_error('Error in output template: ' + str(err) + ' (encoding: ' + repr(preferredencoding()) + ')')
        return None
```

In the corrected code, the function now handles the `$PATH` string properly by replacing it with a different string ('PATH') in the output template, thereby preventing conflicts with encoding and subprocess operations.
