The error message indicates that there is an issue with the `decode` method on a string object in the `uppercase_escape` function. This suggests that the `decode` method is being called on a string, which is not supported in Python 3.

The issue is likely occurring within the lambda function passed to `re.sub`, where it attempts to call `decode` on the matched string.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the `decode` method call and modify the lambda function to handle the escaping of the matched string.

Also, the `import re` statement is missing from the code, so we need to add that at the beginning of the file.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re

def uppercase_escape(s):
    return re.sub(
        r'\\U[0-9a-fA-F]{8}',
        lambda m: chr(int(m.group(0)[2:], 16)), s)
```

In the corrected code, we use `chr` to convert the Unicode escape sequence to its corresponding character. This will handle the escaping correctly and avoid the issue with the `decode` method.
