The error message indicates that the 'str' object has no attribute 'decode', which means the `.decode()` method is being called on a string object, but in Python 3, the `decode()` method is not available for string objects. The error occurs in the `uppercase_escape` function where the `.decode()` method is being used.

To fix this bug, the `decode()` method needs to be replaced with `bytes().decode()` to properly decode the escaped string.

Here's the corrected code for the `uppercase_escape` function:

```python
import re

def uppercase_escape(s):
    return re.sub(
        r'\\U[0-9a-fA-F]{8}',
        lambda m: bytes(m.group(0), 'utf-8').decode('raw_unicode_escape'), s)
```
