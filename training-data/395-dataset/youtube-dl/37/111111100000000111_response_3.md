Potential Error Location: The error occurs in the `uppercase_escape` function in the `utils.py` file at line 1268.

Reasons for the Bug: The `decode` method is used on the result of `m.group(0)`, which is a string. In Python 3, strings already contain Unicode code points, so there is no need to decode them.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug: Use the `encode` method to ensure that the string is in the proper format, and then decode it. Additionally, the `re` module should be imported to use the `sub` function.

Corrected Code:
```python
import re

def uppercase_escape(s):
    return re.sub(
        r'\\U[0-9a-fA-F]{8}',
        lambda m: m.group(0).encode().decode('unicode-escape'), s)
```
