The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError in the `lambda` function within the `uppercase_escape` function. This is likely due to the use of the `decode` method on a string, which is not supported in Python 3.

The `decode` method is used to convert a byte string to a unicode string, but the input `s` to the `uppercase_escape` function is already a unicode string, so the `decode` method is unnecessary. Additionally, the module `re` needs to be imported for the `re.sub` function to work.

To fix the bug, we can remove the unnecessary use of the `decode` method and add the import statement for the `re` module.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def uppercase_escape(s):
    return re.sub(
        r'\\U[0-9a-fA-F]{8}',
        lambda m: bytes(m.group(0), 'utf-8').decode('unicode-escape'), s)
```

With these changes, the `lambda` function should now correctly handle the escaped unicode characters and return the expected results.
