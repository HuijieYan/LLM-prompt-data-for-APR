The bug is occurring in the `uppercase_escape` function. The error message indicates that there is an 'AttributeError' because the 'str' object has no 'decode' attribute. 

The reason for this bug is that the `decode` method is not available for strings in Python 3. The code seems to be trying to decode a string using the `unicode-escape` codec, but it's using an incorrect approach.

To fix this bug, the `decode` method needs to be replaced with the `bytes.decode` method in Python 3. Also, the `re` module needs to be imported at the beginning of the script because it is being used in the function.

Here's the corrected code for the `uppercase_escape` function:

```python
import re

def uppercase_escape(s):
    return re.sub(
        r'\\U[0-9a-fA-F]{8}',
        lambda m: bytes.fromhex(m.group(0)[2:]).decode('unicode-escape'), s)
```

With this correction, the function should now work as expected for the given test cases.
