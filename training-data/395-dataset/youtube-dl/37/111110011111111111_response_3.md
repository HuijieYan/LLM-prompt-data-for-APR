The given function `uppercase_escape` is intended to replace Unicode escape sequences with their corresponding characters. However, there are a few issues with the function:

1. The `re` module is used, but it is not imported in the code. It should be imported by adding `import re` at the beginning of the file.

2. The lambda function used in the `re.sub` call is attempting to call `decode` on the matched string, which is causing an AttributeError because `str` objects do not have a `decode` method in Python 3.

To fix this bug, the lambda function within the `re.sub` call should be replaced with a function that uses `codecs.decode` to decode the escape sequences.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re
import codecs

def uppercase_escape(s):
    return re.sub(
        r'\\U[0-9a-fA-F]{8}',
        lambda m: codecs.decode(m.group(0), 'unicode_escape'), s)
```

This corrected function imports the `codecs` module and uses its `decode` function to properly handle the escape sequences. This should resolve the issue and allow the function to work as expected.
