The error message indicates that the 'str' object has no attribute 'decode', which suggests that the function is attempting to call the decode() method on an object that is already a string. 

The problematic code is within the lambda function inside the re.sub() call in the 'uppercase_escape' function. The lambda function attempts to call decode('unicode-escape') on the matched string, but this is unnecessary because the string is already a Unicode string and does not need decoding.

To fix the bug, the lambda function should simply return the matched string 'm.group(0)' without attempting to decode it.

Here's the corrected code for the 'uppercase_escape' function:

```python
import re

def uppercase_escape(s):
    return re.sub(
        r'\\U[0-9a-fA-F]{8}',
        lambda m: m.group(0), s)
```

With this corrected code, the 'uppercase_escape' function should now work as expected and the respective test cases should pass without any errors.
