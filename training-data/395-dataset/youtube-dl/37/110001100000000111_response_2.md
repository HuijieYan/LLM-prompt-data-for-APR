Potential error location: 

The error seems to be occurring in the `uppercase_escape` function of the `utils.py` file at line 1268. The error message indicates that the `decode` method is being called on a string, which is not supported in Python 3.

Reasons behind the bug: 

The error is occurring because the `decode` method is not available on string objects in Python 3. The `decode` method was used to interpret a string of Unicode code points, which is no longer necessary in Python 3.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

Since the `decode` method is not supported in Python 3, it should be replaced with a more appropriate method or function that achieves the same result.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def uppercase_escape(s):
    def replace_unicode(match):
        return bytes.fromhex(match.group(0)[2:]).decode('utf-32')

    return re.sub(
        r'\\U[0-9a-fA-F]{8}',
        replace_unicode, s)
```
In the corrected code, the `decode` method is replaced with `bytes.fromhex` to decode the Unicode escape sequences in the input string `s`. The `replace_unicode` function is used as the replacement function for the `re.sub` method to perform the decoding.
