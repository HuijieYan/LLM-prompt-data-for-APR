The error occurs in the function `uppercase_escape` in the file `youtube_dl/utils.py`. The error message `AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'decode'` is raised because the `decode` method is being called on a string object, which is not valid in Python 3. 

The reason behind the bug is that the code is trying to handle Unicode escape sequences using the `decode` method, which is not applicable to strings in Python 3. In Python 3, the `decode` method is used to convert bytes to a string, not for handling Unicode escape sequences in a string.

To fix the bug, the `decode` method should be replaced with `codecs.decode` to properly handle Unicode escape sequences in the string.

Here's the corrected code for the `uppercase_escape` function:

```python
import codecs
import re

def uppercase_escape(s):
    return re.sub(
        r'\\U[0-9a-fA-F]{8}',
        lambda m: codecs.decode(m.group(0), 'unicode_escape'), s)
```

With the updated code, the function should be able to handle Unicode escape sequences correctly, and the test case should pass without errors.
