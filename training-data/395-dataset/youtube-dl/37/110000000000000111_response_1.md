The error message indicates that there is an 'AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'decode'' in the function `uppercase_escape`. This points to the line `lambda m: m.group(0).decode('unicode-escape'), s` inside the `uppercase_escape` function as the potential location of the issue.

The reason this error occurs is that in Python 3, string objects do not have a `decode` method. The `decode` method was used in Python 2 to decode a byte string to a Unicode string, but in Python 3, this is done using the `encode` method on byte strings.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the lambda function inside the `re.sub` call in the `uppercase_escape` function to use the `encode` method instead of `decode`.

Here's the corrected code for the `uppercase_escape` function:

```python
import re

def uppercase_escape(s):
    return re.sub(
        r'\\U[0-9a-fA-F]{8}',
        lambda m: bytes.fromhex(m.group(0)[2:]).decode('utf-32'), s)
```

In this corrected code, we use `bytes.fromhex` to convert the matched escape sequence to a byte string and then use the `decode` method to decode it as a Unicode string. This should fix the bug and allow the function to work correctly in Python 3.
