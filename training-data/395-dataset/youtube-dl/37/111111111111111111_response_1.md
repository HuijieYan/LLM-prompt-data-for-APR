The error message indicates that the `decode` method is being called on a string object, which is not allowed in Python 3. The error is occurring in the `uppercase_escape` function in the lambda function passed to the `re.sub` method. This lambda function is trying to call the `decode` method on the matched string, which is causing the AttributeError.

To fix this bug, the lambda function should be modified to use the `codecs` module to decode the Unicode escape sequences.

Here's the corrected code for the `uppercase_escape` function:

```python
import re
import codecs

def uppercase_escape(s):
    return re.sub(
        r'\\U[0-9a-fA-F]{8}',
        lambda m: codecs.decode(m.group(0), 'unicode-escape'), s)
```

This modification uses the `codecs.decode` method to decode the Unicode escape sequences, which will resolve the AttributeError caused by calling the `decode` method on a string object.
