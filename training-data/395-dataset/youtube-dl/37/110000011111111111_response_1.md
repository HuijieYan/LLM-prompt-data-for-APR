The error message states that the 'str' object has no attribute 'decode', which suggests that the `decode` method is being called on a string object. This method is not available for strings in Python 3, which indicates that the `decode` method was intended to be used with byte objects instead.

To fix the bug, the `decode` method should be called on the string content instead of the entire `re.sub` section. The lambda function should decode the matched string from the regular expression using the `unicode-escape` codec.

Here's the corrected code for the `uppercase_escape` function:

```python
import re

def uppercase_escape(s):
    return re.sub(
        r'\\U[0-9a-fA-F]{8}',
        lambda m: m.group(0).encode().decode('unicode-escape'), s)
```

This solution ensures that the `decode` method is called on the string content. Now the `uppercase_escape` function should work as expected and pass the provided test cases.
