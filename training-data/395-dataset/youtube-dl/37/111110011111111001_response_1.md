The error occurs in the `uppercase_escape` function, specifically in the `lambda` function inside the `re.sub` method. The error message suggests that the 'str' object has no attribute 'decode', which means that the `decode` method is being called on a string, which is not supported in Python 3.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `decode` method is not compatible with strings in Python 3. In Python 3, the `decode` method is used with bytes-like objects, not with strings.

To fix the bug, the `lambda` function should be modified to use the `bytes` data type and the `bytes.decode` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `uppercase_escape` function:

```python
import re

def uppercase_escape(s):
    return re.sub(
        r'\\U[0-9a-fA-F]{8}',
        lambda m: bytes.fromhex(m.group(0)[2:]).decode('unicode-escape'), s)

```
