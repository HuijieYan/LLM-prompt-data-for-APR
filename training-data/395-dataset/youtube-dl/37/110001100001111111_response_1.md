The error is occurring in the `uppercase_escape` function in the `youtube_dl/utils.py` file. The error message indicates that a 'str' object has no attribute 'decode', which suggests that the `decode` method is being called on a string, which is not supported.

The `uppercase_escape` function is attempting to use the `re.sub` method to replace occurrences of the pattern `r'\\U[0-9a-fA-F]{8}'` with the result of a lambda function that decodes the matched string using `unicode-escape`. 

To fix the bug, the decode method should be called on the `bytes` object, which can be obtained by using `encode('utf-8')` on the matched string.

Here's the corrected `uppercase_escape` function:

```python
import re

def uppercase_escape(s):
    return re.sub(
        r'\\U[0-9a-fA-F]{8}',
        lambda m: m.group(0).encode('utf-8').decode('unicode-escape'),
        s)
```
