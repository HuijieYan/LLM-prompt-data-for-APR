The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError when calling the `decode` method on a string object. Looking at the function provided, the error occurs on the line with `lambda m: m.group(0).decode('unicode-escape'), s)`.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the `decode` method is not available for string objects in Python 3. The `decode` method was used in Python 2 to decode a string, but in Python 3, the equivalent method is `encode`.

To fix the bug, the `decode` method should be replaced with the `encode` method to decode the escaped unicode characters.

Here's the corrected code for the `uppercase_escape` function:

```python
import re

def uppercase_escape(s):
    return re.sub(
        r'\\U[0-9a-fA-F]{8}',
        lambda m: bytes([int(m.group(0)[2:], 16)]).decode('unicode-escape'), s)
```

In the corrected code, the `decode` method is replaced with `bytes([int(m.group(0)[2:], 16)]).decode('unicode-escape')`, which properly decodes the escaped unicode characters for Python 3.
