The function `uppercase_escape` is trying to use the `decode` method on a string, but this method is only available for byte objects. This is causing the AttributeError when trying to decode the string.

To fix the bug, the `decode` method should be replaced with the `unicode-escape` codec to properly handle the Unicode escape sequences.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import codecs

def uppercase_escape(s):
    return codecs.decode(s, 'unicode-escape')
```
