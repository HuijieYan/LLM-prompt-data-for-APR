The buggy function is attempting to convert Unicode strings to uppercase, but there are several issues in the code.
1. The `re` module is used, but it has not been imported.
2. The `decode` method is being used on the result of `re.sub`, but it should be `unicode_escape.decode('unicode-escape')`.

To fix this bug, we need to import the `re` module and use the correct method to decode the Unicode string.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re

def uppercase_escape(s):
    return re.sub(
        r'\\U[0-9a-fA-F]{8}',
        lambda m: m.group(0).encode().decode('unicode-escape').upper(), s)
```
