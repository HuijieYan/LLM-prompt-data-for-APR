The buggy function `uppercase_escape` is attempting to replace Unicode escape sequences in a string with their corresponding characters. However, there are a few issues with the provided code.

The first issue is that the `re` module is being used but it hasn't been imported. We need to import the `re` module to use the `re.sub` function.

The second issue is with the lambda function that is used in `re.sub`. The `decode` method is being called on the matched string `m.group(0)`, but `decode` is a method available on byte objects, not on strings. There's also no need to use `decode` here.

To fix this, we can import the `re` module and then modify the lambda function to use the `codecs` module to decode the Unicode escape sequences.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re
import codecs

def uppercase_escape(s):
    return re.sub(
        r'\\U[0-9a-fA-F]{8}',
        lambda m: codecs.decode(m.group(0), 'unicode_escape'), s)
```

This updated code imports the `re` module and replaces the `decode` method with `codecs.decode` to properly handle the replacement of Unicode escape sequences.
