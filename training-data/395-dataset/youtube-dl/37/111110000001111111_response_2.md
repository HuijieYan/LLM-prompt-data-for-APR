The error is occurring at the line `lambda m: m.group(0).decode('unicode-escape'), s` in the `uppercase_escape` function. The error message `'str' object has no attribute 'decode'` indicates that the `decode` method is being called on a string object, which is not allowed in Python 3.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `decode` method is not supported on string objects in Python 3. In Python 2, we could use `decode('unicode-escape')` to convert unicode escape sequences to their corresponding unicode characters, but this method is no longer available in Python 3.

To fix the bug, we need to change the approach for converting unicode escape sequences to their corresponding unicode characters in the `uppercase_escape` function. We can achieve this by using the `codecs` module in Python, which provides a `decode` function to handle unicode escape sequences.

Below is the corrected code for the `uppercase_escape` function:

```python
import re
import codecs

def uppercase_escape(s):
    return re.sub(
        r'\\U[0-9a-fA-F]{8}',
        lambda m: codecs.decode(m.group(0), 'unicode-escape'), s)
```

By using `codecs.decode` with the `unicode-escape` codec, we can properly handle unicode escape sequences and fix the bug.
