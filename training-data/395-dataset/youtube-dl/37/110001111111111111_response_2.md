The problematic function is `uppercase_escape` in the file `utils.py`. The error message indicates that the `str` object has no attribute `decode`, which suggests that the `decode` method is not available for `str` objects in Python 3.

The issue seems to be with the `decode` method being used on the string `m.group(0)` inside the lambda function, as shown in the error message. In Python 3, the `decode` method is no longer available for string objects.

To fix this issue, the lambda function should be modified to use `codecs` module from the standard library to decode the Unicode escape sequences in the input string. Here's the corrected code for the `uppercase_escape` function:

```python
import re
import codecs

def uppercase_escape(s):
    return re.sub(
        r'\\U[0-9a-fA-F]{8}',
        lambda m: codecs.decode(m.group(0), 'unicode-escape'), s)
```

By using the `codecs.decode` method, the Unicode escape sequences can be properly decoded in a string for both Python 2 and 3. This should fix the bug and allow the function to work correctly with the provided test cases.
