The bug in the provided function is that it is trying to use the `decode` method on the matched string within the lambda function, which is causing an AttributeError.

To fix this bug, we can use the `codecs` module to decode the matched string using the `unicode_escape` encoding.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re
import codecs

def uppercase_escape(s):
    return re.sub(
        r'\\U[0-9a-fA-F]{8}',
        lambda m: codecs.decode(m.group(0), 'unicode_escape'), s)
```
