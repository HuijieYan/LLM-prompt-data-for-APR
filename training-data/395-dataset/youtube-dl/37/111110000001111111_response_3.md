The error message indicates that there is an 'AttributeError' on line 1268 of the 'utils.py' file in the youtube-dl project. The error is related to the 'decode' method being called on a string object.

The issue is caused by the use of the 'decode' method on a string object in the 'uppercase_escape' function in the 'utils.py' file. The 'decode' method is used to decode byte strings, not regular strings.

To fix this bug, the 'decode' method should be removed and the function should be modified to use the 'codecs' module to decode the escape sequences.

Here is the corrected code for the 'uppercase_escape' function:

```python
import re
import codecs

def uppercase_escape(s):
    return re.sub(
        r'\\U[0-9a-fA-F]{8}',
        lambda m: codecs.decode(m.group(0), 'unicode-escape'), s)
```

By using the 'codecs' module to decode the escape sequences, the function will correctly handle the Unicode escape sequences and avoid the 'AttributeError' that occurred in the original function.
