Potential error location: The error is occurring in the `uppercase_escape` function, specifically in the lambda function inside the `re.sub` call. The `decode` method is being called on `m.group(0)` which is a string, resulting in the 'AttributeError: 'str' object has no attribute 'decode''.

Reasons behind the bug: The `decode` method is not applicable to the string object in Python 3. In Python 3, strings are already Unicode, so decoding is not necessary. The `decode` method was used in Python 2 to decode byte strings into Unicode strings.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Remove the `decode` method from the lambda function, as it is not needed in Python 3.
2. Convert the byte string `m.group(0)` into a Unicode string using `bytes.decode('unicode-escape')` and then apply `re.sub` to it. 

Corrected code:

```python
import re

def uppercase_escape(s):
    return re.sub(
        r'\\U[0-9a-fA-F]{8}',
        lambda m: m.group(0).encode().decode('unicode-escape'), s)
```
