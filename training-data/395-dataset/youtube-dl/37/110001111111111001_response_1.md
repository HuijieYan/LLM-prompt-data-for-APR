The error occurs in the `uppercase_escape` function. The lambda function inside `re.sub` is trying to use the `decode` method on the match group, but the `str` object does not have the `decode` method in Python 3.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the code is trying to use the `decode` method on a string, which is not allowed in Python 3. The `decode` method is used for bytes objects, not strings.

To fix the bug, the `unicode-escape` decoding needs to be done directly on the matched string, and the lambda function should be replaced with the decoded value.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re

def uppercase_escape(s):
    return re.sub(
        r'\\U[0-9a-fA-F]{8}',
        lambda m: chr(int(m.group(0)[2:], 16)), s)
```

With this corrected code, the function `uppercase_escape` should work as expected and pass the provided test cases.
