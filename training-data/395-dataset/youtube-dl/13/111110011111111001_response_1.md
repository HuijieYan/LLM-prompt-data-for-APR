The error message shows that in the test case where the input parameters are `None` and `'rtmp://foo.de'`, the expected output is `'rtmp://foo.de'`, but the actual output is `None`. This indicates that the function is not handling the case where the `base` parameter is `None` correctly.

The potential error location within the function is the conditional check for the `base` parameter before parsing the URL. If the `base` is `None`, the function should return the `path` as is, rather than returning `None`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not handling the `None` case for the `base` parameter correctly. The conditional check is not capturing the `None` condition.

To fix the bug, the function should add a conditional check for `None` specifically for the `base` parameter. If the `base` is `None`, the function should return the `path` as is.

Here's the corrected code for the `urljoin` function:

```python
import re
from urllib.parse import urljoin as compat_urlparse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if base is None:
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```

With this corrected code, the function will handle the `None` case for the `base` parameter and return the `path` as is. This should resolve the error observed in the test case.
