The error message is indicating that the function is returning `None` instead of the expected value 'rtmp://foo.de' when the inputs are `None` and 'rtmp://foo.de'. 

The potential error is in the part of the code where `None` is being checked and it is not returning the expected value.

The bug occurs because the function is not handling the case where `base` is `None`.

The possible approach for fixing the bug is to add a condition to handle the case when `base` is `None` and return the `path` in that case.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urljoin

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if base is None:
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return urljoin(base, path)
```
