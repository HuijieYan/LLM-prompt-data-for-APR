The potential error in the provided function is at the line `if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:`. The `compat_str` type is not defined in the code, and it is unclear what it is supposed to represent.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is the use of an undefined type `compat_str`. It is not clear what type it should be, and it is not imported or defined in the code snippet.

To fix the bug, we can use the `str` type instead of `compat_str`. We can also remove the check for the `compat_str` type and simply check if the `path` is a non-empty string.

Here's the corrected code for the `urljoin` function:

```python
import re
from urllib.parse import urljoin as compat_urlparse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not base or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```
