Potential error location: The bug seems to be located in the conditional statement `if not isinstance(base, compat_str)`. It should probably check if `base` is of type `bytes`.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug occurs because the function is not handling the `base` parameter properly, as it assumes that it is a string and attempts to decode it from bytes. This leads to potential type errors and incorrect behavior.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Check if the `base` parameter is of type `bytes`, and if so, decode it to `utf-8`.
2. Use error handling to gracefully handle any type or decoding errors that may occur.

Corrected code:

```python
def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, compat_str) or not re.match(
            r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```
