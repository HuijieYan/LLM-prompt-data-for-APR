The bug is occurring due to the incorrect use of the `compat_str` variable, as well as the use of `re.match` without importing the `re` module. `compat_str` is not a built-in Python type, so it seems to be a custom type available in another module. The issue is also related to the handling of path and base variables as bytes or strings.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we are using the correct type checking for strings and bytes, and also incorporate the `re` module for regular expressions.

Here's the corrected code for the `urljoin` function:

```python
import re
import urllib.parse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, str) or not re.match(
            r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return urllib.parse.urljoin(base, path)
```
