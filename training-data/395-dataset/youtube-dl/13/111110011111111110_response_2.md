The issue with the `urljoin` function is that it is not correctly checking the type of the `path` and `base` parameters and handling the cases where they are either bytes or strings. It is also not importing the necessary modules for `re` and `compat_urlparse`. 

Here is the corrected function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
import re
from six import string_types as compat_str
from urllib.parse import urljoin as compat_urlparse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if not isinstance(base, compat_str) or not re.match(
            r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```

With this corrected function, the `test_urljoin` function should execute without errors.
