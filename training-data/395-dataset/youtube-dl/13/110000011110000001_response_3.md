The test case test_urljoin(self) is testing the urljoin function with various input combinations to check if the function returns the expected output. 

The error message indicates that the assertion failed for the test case where urljoin is called with None as the first argument and 'rtmp://foo.de' as the second argument. The expected output was 'rtmp://foo.de' but the function returned None.

The potential error location within the urljoin function is the if statement that checks if the base argument is None. If it is, the function should return the path argument without joining it with the base argument.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where the base argument is None, leading to a None return value instead of propagating the path argument.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to handle the case where the base argument is None. We should add a condition to check if the base argument is None and return the path argument if it is.

Here's the corrected code for the urljoin function:

```python
import re
from youtube_dl.compat import compat_str
from youtube_dl.utils import compat_urlparse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
        return None
    if base is None:
        return path
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, compat_str) or not re.match(
            r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```
