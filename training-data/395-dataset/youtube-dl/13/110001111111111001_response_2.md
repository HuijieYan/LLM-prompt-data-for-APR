The bug seems to be occurring in the `urljoin` function due to incorrect handling of the `base` and `path` parameters. This function is intended to join a base URL with a relative path, but it is not handling the different possible types of the base and path correctly.

The error message is indicating that when `urljoin(None, 'rtmp://foo.de')` is called, the function returns `None` instead of the expected result `'rtmp://foo.de'`. This suggests that when the `base` parameter is `None`, the function is not handling it correctly.

The buggy function is not handling the different types of input parameters properly. For example, when `base` is `None`, it is not correctly handling this case and returning `None` instead of processing the `path`. It is also not handling the cases where the `path` is already an absolute URL or when the `base` is a different type, such as bytes or a list.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `urljoin` function to handle these different cases by checking the type of the input parameters and processing them accordingly.

The corrected function for `urljoin` is as follows:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin as urllib_urljoin

def urljoin(base, path):
    if base is None and isinstance(path, str) and path.startswith('http'):
        return path
    elif isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    return urllib_urljoin(base, path)
```

This corrected version of the function uses the `urllib.parse.urljoin` function, which handles the different cases of base and path URLs more robustly. It first checks if the base is `None` and the path is a string starting with 'http' to handle the absolute URL case. Then it decodes the binary inputs to strings and uses the `urllib_urljoin` to handle the URL joining.
