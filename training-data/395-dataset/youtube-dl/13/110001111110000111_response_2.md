The test function calls the `urljoin` function with various input combinations of base and path and expects the correct URL to be returned. 

The error occurs when the `urljoin` function is called with `None` as the base URL and 'rtmp://foo.de' as the path. The function returns `None` instead of the expected 'rtmp://foo.de'.

The potential error location is in the handling of the `None` base URL within the `urljoin` function. It seems that the function considers `None` as an invalid base URL and does not handle it properly.

The bug occurs because the condition `if not isinstance(base, compat_str)` is met when `base` is `None`, causing the function to return `None` instead of processing the path as a complete URL.

To fix the bug, the `urljoin` function should handle the `None` case explicitly and return the path as a complete URL if it starts with 'http' or 'https'. 

The corrected function is:

```python
import re
import urllib.parse as urlparse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if path is None:
        return None
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
        
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    
    if base is None:
        if path.startswith('http') or path.startswith('https'):
            return path
        else:
            return None

    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```
