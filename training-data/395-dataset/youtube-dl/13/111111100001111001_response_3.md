Potential error location: The bug is likely occurring in the condition `if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path`. This condition is checking if `path` is not a `compat_str` type or if it's an empty string. However, it should be checking if `path` is not a `compat_str` type OR if it's an empty string AND it's not equal to `'//'`.

Reasons behind the bug: The condition is not checking for an empty string in the correct way, leading to incorrect validation of the `path` variable.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the condition to check for an empty string correctly by using `and` instead of `or`.
2. Check if the `path` variable is equal to `'//'` before the empty string check.

Corrected code:
```python
# relative function's signature in this file
def urljoin(base, path):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# corrected function
def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or (path == '' or path == '//'):
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, compat_str) or not re.match(
            r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```
