Potential error location: The bug could be at the `isinstance` check for `path` and `base` variables, as well as the `compat_str` check.

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs because the `compat_str` type is not defined in the given function, and the `isinstance` checks for `path` and `base` should be checking for `str` instead.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define the `compat_str` type if it is a custom type, or replace it with the built-in `str` type.
2. Update the `isinstance` checks to check for the `str` type instead.

Corrected code:

```python
import re
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urljoin

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, str) or not re.match(
            r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return urljoin(base, path)
```
