The error occurs when the function `urljoin` is called with `None` as the base URL and a non-None path URL. In this case, the function returns the path URL as is, without joining it with the base URL.

The potential error location within the function is the conditional statement:
```python
if not isinstance(base, compat_str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
    return None
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function incorrectly returns `None` when the base URL is `None`, even if the path URL is valid. This is not the expected behavior.

To fix the bug, we can modify the conditional statement to check if the base URL is `None` and in that case, directly return the path URL.

Here's the corrected code for the `urljoin` function:

```python
import re
from six import compat_str
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urljoin as compat_urlparse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
        return None
    if base is None:
        return path
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, compat_str) or not re.match(
            r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```

With this modification, the function should now correctly handle the case where the base URL is `None` and return the path URL as expected.
