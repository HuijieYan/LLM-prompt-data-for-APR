Potential error location:
The error seems to arise from the case where the function `urljoin` is called with `None` as the first argument, and it should return the second argument.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
In the buggy code, when `urljoin` is called with `None` as the first argument, it returns `None` instead of the second argument, which is incorrect.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, we need to check if the `base` argument is `None` and return the `path` argument in that case. This will ensure that when `None` is passed as the `base` argument, the function returns the `path` argument.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/youtube-dl_13/youtube_dl/utils.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def urljoin(base, path):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def urljoin(base, path):
    if base is None:
        return path
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, compat_str) or not re.match(
            r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```
