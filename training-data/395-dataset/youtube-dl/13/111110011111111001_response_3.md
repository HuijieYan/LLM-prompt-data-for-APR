The test_urljoin method is testing the urljoin function with various input cases. The error message indicates that for the input (None, 'rtmp://foo.de'), the expected output should be 'rtmp://foo.de', but the actual output is None.

The potential error location in the urljoin function is the handling of None types for the base parameter. When the base parameter is None, the function should return the path as the absolute URL.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where the base parameter is None, causing it to return None instead of the path itself.

To fix the bug, we can add a condition to check if the base parameter is None. If it is, we can simply return the path as the absolute URL.

Here's the corrected code for the urljoin function:

```python
import re
from urllib.parse import urljoin as urlparse_urljoin

def urljoin(base, path):
    if base is None:
        return path

    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')

    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:
        return None

    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path

    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')

    if not isinstance(base, str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None

    return urlparse_urljoin(base, path)
```

With this correction, the test case that previously failed (`self.assertEqual(urljoin(None, 'rtmp://foo.de'), 'rtmp://foo.de')`) should now pass.
