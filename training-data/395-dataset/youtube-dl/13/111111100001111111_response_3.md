The `urljoin` function takes two parameters, `base` and `path`, and attempts to join them to create a URL. However, the function currently has some issues with handling different data types for `base` and `path` inputs.

The function checks whether the `path` parameter is a byte string, and if so, it decodes it to a UTF-8 string. Then, it checks if the `path` is of type `compat_str` and whether it is empty. If both conditions are satisfied, it returns `None`. Otherwise, it continues with additional checks and eventually attempts to join the `base` and `path` using `compat_urlparse.urljoin`.

The potential bug occurs in the initial type checks and decoding. When checking if the `path` is of type `compat_str`, it should compare it with the correct type rather than checking if it is `None`. Additionally, the type of the `base` parameter should be handled consistently throughout the function.

To fix the function, we need to correct the type checks and ensure consistent handling of byte strings and regular strings. Here's the corrected code:

```python
from youtube_dl.compat import compat_str
import re
from youtube_dl.compat import compat_urlparse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or path == '':
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, compat_str) or not re.match(
            r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```
