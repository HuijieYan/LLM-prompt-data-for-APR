The error in the code is occurring due to the incorrect handling of the `None` value. In the `urljoin` function, if the base URL is None, it should return the path as it is, but the current implementation is returning `None` instead.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `urljoin` function to handle the `None` case properly.

One potential approach for fixing the bug is to add a check for `None` at the beginning of the function and return the path if the base URL is `None`.

Here's the corrected code for the `urljoin` function:

```python
import re
from six import PY2, text_type, binary_type
import six.moves.urllib_parse as compat_urlparse

compat_str = text_type if PY2 else (str, bytes)
compat_urlparse = text_type if PY2 else accomp_urlparse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if base is None:
        return path
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, compat_str) or not re.match(
            r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```

With this correction, the `urljoin` function will handle the `None` case properly and return the path when the base URL is `None`, fixing the error encountered in the test case.
