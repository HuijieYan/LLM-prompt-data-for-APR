The issue is that the function `urljoin` is not formatted correctly and there are potential issues with the checks for types and the use of regular expressions.

1. The error stems from the check for types and the use of regular expressions, which can cause the function to return `None` when it shouldn't.
2. The type checks are incorrect and the regular expression check may give false negatives.
3. The bug occurs due to the incorrect use of type checking and regular expressions, causing the function to return `None` incorrectly.
4. Correct the type checks and regular expression usage to ensure that the function does not return `None` incorrectly.
5. Here is the corrected code for the `urljoin` function:

```python
import re
from youtube_dl.compat import compat_urlparse, compat_str

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
        return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, compat_str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```
