Potential Error Location: 
The potential error in the code is the check for the type 'compat_str' which is not defined and could be causing the issue.

Reason for the Bug:
The code is trying to check if the 'path' and 'base' variables are compatible strings, but it is using a type 'compat_str' which is not defined anywhere in the code.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use the correct type for string compatibility checks, such as 'str' or 'unicode' (for Python 2).
2. Use the 'six' library to handle compatibility between Python 2 and Python 3.

Corrected Code:
```python
import six
import re
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, six.string_types) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, six.string_types) or not re.match(
            r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return urljoin(base, path)
```
