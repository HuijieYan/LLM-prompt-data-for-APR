The error message from the test indicates that when `urljoin(None, 'rtmp://foo.de')` is called, it returns `None` instead of `'rtmp://foo.de'`, which is unexpected.

The potential error location within the function is the following two lines:
```python
if not isinstance(base, compat_str) or not re.match(
        r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
    return None
```
This condition checks if `base` is not a string or if it does not match the URL pattern, and if so, it returns `None`. This is leading to the unexpected behavior when `None` is passed as `base`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function should handle the case where `base` is `None` differently. Instead of returning `None` immediately, it should handle the `None` value and proceed with the URL joining operation.

To fix the bug, the corrected code for the `urljoin` function is as follows:

```python
def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    
    if not base:
        base = ''
        
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
        
    if not path or not isinstance(path, compat_str):
        return None
    
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path

    if not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None

    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```

In the corrected code:
- The `if not base:` condition is added to handle the `None` value of `base`.
- If `base` is `None`, it is replaced with an empty string (`''`), and the subsequent check ensures that `base` matches the URL pattern.
- The URL joining operation is performed using `compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)`.

With these changes, the function should now handle the `None` value for `base` and return the correct result.
