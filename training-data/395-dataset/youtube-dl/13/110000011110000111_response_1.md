The error occurs in the 'urljoin' function. The function is incorrectly checking if the 'base' and 'path' are of type 'compat_str' and are not empty. Additionally, it is not handling the case where the 'base' is None. This causes the function to return None instead of joining the base URL with the path.

The potential error location is the second if statement:
```python
if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
        return None
```

One potential approach to fixing the bug is to remove the check for the type 'compat_str' and instead check if 'path' is a string and if it is empty. Then, for the 'base' variable, we should also check if it is None and return None if it is.

Here's the corrected code for the 'urljoin' function:

```python
# Corrected urljoin function
def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if base is None:
        return None
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```

By making these changes, the 'urljoin' function should now handle the test cases correctly and return the expected results.
