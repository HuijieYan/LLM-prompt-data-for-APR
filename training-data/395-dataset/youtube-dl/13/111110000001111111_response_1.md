Potential error location: The code is trying to check whether the `base` and `path` variables are string or bytes during the function execution, but there is no definition for the `compat_str` variable, and the import for the `re` module is missing.

Reasons behind the bug: The code is using undefined variables and missing module imports, which leads to errors when the function is executed.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define `compat_str` as the string type (e.g., `typing.Text`).
2. Import the `re` module for regular expressions.

Corrected code:

```python
import re
import typing

# this is the corrected function
def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, typing.Text) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, typing.Text) or not re.match(
            r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```
