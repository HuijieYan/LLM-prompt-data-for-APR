The error seems to be occurring when the `urljoin` function is called with `None` as the `base` parameter. The function should return `None` in this case, but it incorrectly returns the `path` parameter instead.

The problem seems to be in the conditional statements checking for the type of the `path` and `base` parameters. The function also appears to be using `compat_str` and `compat_urlparse` which are not defined within the function.

To fix this issue, we can do the following:
1. Import the necessary modules and dependencies at the beginning of the function.
2. Add proper type checking conditions for `path` and `base`.
3. Handle the case where the `base` parameter is `None` separately to return `None`.
4. Update the `import` statements and modify the function to use `urlparse` from the `urllib.parse` module.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re
from urllib.parse import urljoin as compat_urlparse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if base is None:
        return None
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```

With these changes, the function should handle the input parameters and return the correct values as expected in the test cases.
