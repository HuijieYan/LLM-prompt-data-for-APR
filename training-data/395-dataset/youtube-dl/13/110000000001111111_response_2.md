The buggy function `urljoin` is intended to join a base URL with a relative URL path. The bug seems to be that the function checks if the `path` is a string or not, and if it isn't, it returns `None`. However, in some cases, when the `path` is a valid string, it still returns `None` due to the conditions not being correctly implemented.

Additionally, the function has a few other issues:
1. It is using undefined variables `compat_str` and `compat_urlparse`, which are not imported or defined anywhere in the code.
2. It incorrectly checks if the base URL starts with `http://` or `https://` using a regular expression. This may not work correctly in some cases, especially when dealing with different protocols.

To fix the function, the following steps can be taken:
1. Use the `or` operator to check if the path is a falsy value, and return `None` if it is.
2. Remove the check for `http://` or `https://` at the start of the base URL, and simply check if the given base URL is valid.
3. Use the `urljoin` function from the `urllib.parse` module to join the base URL and the relative path.

Here's the corrected code for the `urljoin` function:

```python
import re
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not path:
        return None
    if base.startswith(('http://', 'https://')):
        return urljoin(base, path)
    else:
        return None
```

This corrected code checks if the `path` is empty or not and then uses the `urljoin` function from the `urllib.parse` module to join the base URL and the path, if the base URL is valid.
