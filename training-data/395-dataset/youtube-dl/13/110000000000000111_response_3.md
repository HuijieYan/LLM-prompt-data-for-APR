Potential Error Location: The if statement checking for `not isinstance(path, compat_str)` and `not path` seems to be causing the issue.

Reason for the Bug: The condition `not isinstance(path, compat_str)` is likely to be the cause of the problem as `compat_str` is not defined in the function and is probably intended to be a string type check.

Approach for Fixing the Bug: Update the isinstance condition to check if `path` is a string type.

Corrected Code:
```python
import re
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:  # Updated to check for string type
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return urljoin(base, path)  # Using Python's built-in urljoin function
```
