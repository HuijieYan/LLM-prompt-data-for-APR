The issue with the given function is that it checks the type of the `base` and `path` input parameters using the `compat_str` type, which is not defined in the code provided. Additionally, the function uses the `compat_urlparse.urljoin()` method, which is also not defined in the given code.

To fix this issue, we can remove the checks for the `compat_str` type and replace the usage of `compat_urlparse.urljoin()` with the `urllib.parse.urljoin()` method, which is a built-in Python method for joining URLs.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import re
import urllib.parse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return urllib.parse.urljoin(base, path)
```
