The error message indicates that the function is returning None when it should be returning 'rtmp://foo.de'.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the first if condition:
```python
if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
    return None
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the check for `compat_str` is not properly implemented.

To fix the bug, the corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, str) or not re.match(
            r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```
