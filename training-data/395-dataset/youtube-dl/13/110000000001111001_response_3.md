The potential error in the function is in the condition where it checks if the `path` input starts with "http:" or "https:". The function is also using the `compat_str` and `compat_urlparse` variables that are not defined in the code provided.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the function is using undefined variables and also not handling the different types of input properly.

To fix the bug, we can use the `urljoin` function from the `urllib.parse` module provided by Python's standard library. This function handles joining the base URL and a relative URL path with proper support for different types of inputs.

Here's the corrected code for the `urljoin` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def urljoin(base, path):
    return urljoin(base, path)
```

This corrected code simply uses the `urljoin` function from the `urllib.parse` module to properly join the base URL and the path. This fix handles different types of inputs and avoids the use of undefined variables.
