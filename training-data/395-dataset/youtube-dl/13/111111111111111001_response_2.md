The error occurs in the buggy implementation of the `urljoin` function. The function is supposed to join a base URL with a relative URL to create a full URL. The bug occurs due to incorrect conditions in the function that cause it to return `None` in some cases when it should not.

The buggy function has multiple issues:
1. It first checks if the input `path` is a `bytes` object and decodes it to a `str`. This conversion should happen only if the `path` is of type `bytes`.
2. It then checks if the `path` is not of type `compat_str` or if it's empty and returns `None`, which is incorrect.
3. It doesn't handle the case where `base` is `None` correctly. It should return the `path` if `base` is `None`.
4. It incorrectly checks if `base` is a `bytes` object and decodes it. This should be done only if the `base` is of type `bytes`.
5. It doesn't handle the case where `re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path)` returns `None`.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified as follows:
```python
import re

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')

    if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
        return path
    
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path

    if not base or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return path

    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
``` 

This fixed function will handle the cases correctly and return the expected results for the given test cases.
