The bug in the `urljoin` function is likely due to the incorrect handling of input types and conditions. The function is designed to join a base URL with a path. However, it fails to properly handle input types, such as bytes and strings, and the conditions to check for valid URLs are not comprehensive.

The error message from the test function indicates that the `urljoin` function is returning `None` instead of the expected value of `'rtmp://foo.de'` in the specific test case `urljoin(None, 'rtmp://foo.de')`.

To fix the bug, the `urljoin` function needs to handle input types and conditions properly to ensure that it can accurately join the base URL with the given path.

Here's the corrected code for the `urljoin` function:

```python
import re
from youtube_dl.compat import compat_str
from youtube_dl.compat import compat_urlparse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8') if base else ''
    if not isinstance(base, compat_str) or not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```

In the corrected code:
- The imports for `compat_str` and `compat_urlparse` are added.
- Conditions for verifying the input types and checking for valid URLs are fixed.
- The handling of base URL as bytes and empty is fixed.
- The return statement is updated to correctly utilize the `compat_urlparse.urljoin` function.

This corrected code should address the bug and ensure proper functionality of the `urljoin` function.
