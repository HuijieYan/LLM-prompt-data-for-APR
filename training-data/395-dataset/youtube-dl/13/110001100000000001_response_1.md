Potential Error:
The error lies in the conditional statement `if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:`. The `compat_str` type is not defined within the function, and this conditional check is not valid.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because `compat_str` is not defined within the function, and it is being used as a data type for comparison.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
1. Remove the `compat_str` type and simply check if `path` is not an empty string.
2. Import the required modules if they are not already imported in the function.

Corrected Code:
```python
import re
from youtube_dl.compat import compat_urlparse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not path:  # Check if path is not an empty string
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```
