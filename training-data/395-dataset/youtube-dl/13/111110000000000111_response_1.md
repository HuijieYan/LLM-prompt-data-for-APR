Potential Error:
The error occurs when the function tries to decode the `path` and `base` if they are of type `bytes`. However, it does not check if `base` is also a `bytes` type before trying to decode it.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function only checks if `path` is of type `bytes` before decoding it, but it doesn't do the same for `base`.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to check if `base` is of type `bytes` before trying to decode it. Additionally, we should also import the required modules (e.g., `compat_str`, `re`, `compat_urlparse`) for the function to work properly.

Corrected Code:
```python
import re
from six import text_type as compat_str
from six.moves.urllib import parse as compat_urlparse

def urljoin(base, path):
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, compat_str) or not re.match(
            r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```
