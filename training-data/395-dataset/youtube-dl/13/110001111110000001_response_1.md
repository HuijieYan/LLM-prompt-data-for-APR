The test case is testing the 'urljoin' function multiple times with different input parameters and comparing the actual and expected results. The error is occurring when 'urljoin' is called with input parameters (None, 'rtmp://foo.de') and the expected result is 'rtmp://foo.de'. However, it is returning None instead.

The potential error location within the 'urljoin' function is the condition where instead of returning the 'path' if the 'base' is None, it should explicitly check if the 'base' is None and then return the 'path' directly.

The reason behind the bug is that the 'urljoin' function is not handling the case when 'base' is None. It is not explicitly checking and handling the case when 'base' is None and returns None directly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the 'urljoin' function to include a specific check for the 'base' being None and return 'path' directly in that case.

Here's the corrected code for the 'urljoin' function:

```python
# corrected function
def urljoin(base, path):
    if base is None:  # added explicit check for base being None
        return path
    if isinstance(path, bytes):
        path = path.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(path, compat_str) or not path:
        return None
    if re.match(r'^(?:https?:)?//', path):
        return path
    if isinstance(base, bytes):
        base = base.decode('utf-8')
    if not isinstance(base, compat_str) or not re.match(
            r'^(?:https?:)?//', base):
        return None
    return compat_urlparse.urljoin(base, path)
```
