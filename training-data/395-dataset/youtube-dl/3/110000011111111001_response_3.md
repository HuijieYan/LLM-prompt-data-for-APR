The issue seems to be with the way HTML entities are being unescaped in the `unescapeHTML` function. The function is using `re.sub` to replace HTML entities, but it may not be handling all cases correctly.

The error message from the test function indicates that the function is not correctly unescaping the HTML entity `&a&quot;`.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `unescapeHTML` function to use the `html` module for unescaping HTML entities. This will provide a more comprehensive and accurate unescaping of HTML entities.

Here's the corrected code for the `unescapeHTML` function:

```python
import html

def unescapeHTML(s):
    if s is None:
        return None
    return html.unescape(s)
```

With this corrected code, the function will use the `html.unescape` method, which is a built-in method for unescaping HTML entities. This should handle all cases of HTML entity unescaping correctly, resolving the bug in the original function.
