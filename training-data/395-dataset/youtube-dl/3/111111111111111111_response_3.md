The issue seems to be with the unescapeHTML function not correctly handling certain HTML entities. The function makes use of the _htmlentity_transform function, but it is not implemented correctly. The function should use the html module of Python for handling the HTML entities.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the current implementation of the _htmlentity_transform function may not be correctly handling all HTML entities.

To fix the bug, we need to use the HTMLParser module from Python's standard library to unescape the HTML entities properly.

Here's the corrected code for the unescapeHTML function:

```python
import html

def unescapeHTML(s):
    if s is None:
        return None
    assert type(s) == compat_str
    
    return html.unescape(s)
```

This implementation uses the html module to properly unescape the HTML entities in the input string.
