The buggy function is `unescapeHTML` and the error is likely occurring in the `re.sub` call, where the `_htmlentity_transform` function is being passed the entity with a semicolon.

The bug is likely caused because the `re.sub` call is not finding the correct pattern to replace in the input string `s`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the regular expression pattern in the `re.sub` call to correctly match the HTML entities and then apply the `_htmlentity_transform` function to replace those entities with their respective characters.

Here's the corrected code for the `unescapeHTML` function:

```python
import re

def _htmlentity_transform(entity_with_semicolon):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def unescapeHTML(s):
    if s is None:
        return None
    assert type(s) == compat_str
    
    return re.sub(
        r'&([^\s]*?);', lambda m: _htmlentity_transform(m.group(1)), s
    )
```

By updating the regular expression pattern to `r'&([^\s]*?);'`, we ensure that it matches HTML entities correctly and replaces them using the `_htmlentity_transform` function. This should fix the bug and correctly unescape the HTML entities in the input string `s`.
