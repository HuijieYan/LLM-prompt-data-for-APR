The issue is with the unescapeHTML function which is not properly handling HTML entities. The function is using re.sub to replace HTML entities with their corresponding characters, but it's not correctly calling _htmlentity_transform for each entity.

The _htmlentity_transform function should be used to replace known HTML entities with their corresponding characters. The re.sub function should call _htmlentity_transform for each matching entity.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re

# relative function's signature in this file
def _htmlentity_transform(entity_with_semicolon):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass


def unescapeHTML(s):
    if s is None:
        return None
    assert isinstance(s, str)
    
    return re.sub(
        r'&([^;]+;)', lambda m: _htmlentity_transform(m.group(0)), s)
```

With this fix, the unescapeHTML function should correctly handle HTML entity replacements.
