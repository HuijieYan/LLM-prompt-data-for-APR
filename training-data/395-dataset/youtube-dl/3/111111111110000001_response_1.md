Potential error location:
The potential error in the `unescapeHTML` function is likely in the regular expression substitution using `re.sub`. The lambda function `_htmlentity_transform` is used to replace HTML entities with their actual characters, but it seems that there is an issue with the lambda function's logic.

Reasons behind the bug:
The bug occurs because the lambda function `_htmlentity_transform` is not correctly handling the HTML entities and transforming them into their corresponding characters. This is evident from the error message and specific test case `self.assertEqual(unescapeHTML('&a&quot;'), '&a"')`.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
The lambda function `_htmlentity_transform` needs to correctly map the HTML entities to their corresponding characters. This can be achieved by using a mapping of HTML entities to their characters or by using external libraries that provide this functionality.

Corrected code for the `unescapeHTML` function:
```python
import html

def unescapeHTML(s):
    if s is None:
        return None
    assert type(s) == compat_str

    return html.unescape(s)
```
In the corrected code, we use the `html` module in Python, which provides the `unescape` function to handle HTML entities and correctly transform them into their corresponding characters. This will ensure that the `unescapeHTML` function works as intended and resolves the bug.
