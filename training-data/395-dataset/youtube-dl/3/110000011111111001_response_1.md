The error is occurring in the function `unescapeHTML` when it is called with the input `&a&quot;`. The expected output is `&a"` but the function is returning `&a&quot;`.

The issue is with the regular expression used in the `re.sub` call within the `unescapeHTML` function. The regular expression is not able to handle the specific case of `&a&quot;`. 

To fix this issue, we need to modify the regular expression to handle HTML entities that end with a semicolon.

Here's the corrected code for the `unescapeHTML` function:

```python
import re

def unescapeHTML(s):
    if s is None:
        return None
    assert type(s) == str

    return re.sub(
        r'&([^;&]+;)', lambda m: _htmlentity_transform(m.group(1)), s)
```

This modification to the regular expression will match HTML entities that end with a semicolon and correctly handle cases like `&a&quot;`.
