Potential error location: The `assert` statement is checking if the type of `s` is `compat_str`, but `compat_str` is not a defined type in the given code. This is leading to a NameError.

Reason for the bug: The `compat_str` type is not defined within the given code, so the assert statement is causing a NameError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Remove the assert statement altogether.
2. If `compat_str` is a custom defined type, make sure it is imported or defined within the function.
3. Replace `compat_str` with the actual type that the input `s` is supposed to be.

Updated code:
```python
import re

def unescapeHTML(s):
    if s is None:
        return None

    return re.sub(
        r'&([^;]+;)', lambda m: _htmlentity_transform(m.group(1)), s)
```
