The error is occurring in the `test_unescape_html` function, where the assertion `self.assertEqual(unescapeHTML('&a&quot;'), '&a"')` is failing. The expected value is `&a"` but the actual value is `&a&quot;`.

The bug is in the `unescapeHTML` function. The function is using the `re.sub` method, but it is not correctly handling the replacement of HTML entities. This is causing the entities to not be properly unescaped.

To fix this bug, the `unescapeHTML` function should be updated to properly handle the unescaping of HTML entities. This can be done by using the `html` module to unescape HTML entities.

Here is the corrected code for the `unescapeHTML` function:

```python
import html

def unescapeHTML(s):
    if s is None:
        return None
    assert type(s) == compat_str

    return html.unescape(s)
```

This corrected code uses the `html` module to properly unescape HTML entities, ensuring that the test cases will pass without any assertion errors.
