Potential error location: The bug is likely occurring in the unescapeHTML function, where the regex substitution is not working as expected to unescape the HTML entities.

Reasons behind the bug: The issue is likely caused by the incorrect regex pattern used in the re.sub call within the unescapeHTML function. The regex pattern is not correctly capturing the HTML entities.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the regex pattern to correctly capture the HTML entities.
2. Use a different approach, such as the html module in Python, to unescape HTML entities.

Corrected code for the unescapeHTML function:

```python
import re
import html

def unescapeHTML(s):
    if s is None:
        return None
    
    return html.unescape(s)
```

The html module in Python provides a built-in method `html.unescape` that can be used to accurately unescape HTML entities in a given string, avoiding the need for a custom regex-based solution.
