Potential error location: The potential error is likely in the unescapeHTML function, particularly in the lambda function where the _htmlentity_transform function is called.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug is likely occurring because the _htmlentity_transform function is not correctly transforming HTML entities in the lambda function. Additionally, the assertion that s is of type compat_str may not be correct.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the lambda function to correctly transform HTML entities using the _htmlentity_transform function.
2. Remove the assertion that s is of type compat_str and handle the input string in a more flexible manner.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import re

def _htmlentity_transform(entity_with_semicolon):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def unescapeHTML(s):
    if s is None:
        return None
    
    return re.sub(
        r'&([^;]+;)', lambda m: _htmlentity_transform(m.group(0)), s)
```
