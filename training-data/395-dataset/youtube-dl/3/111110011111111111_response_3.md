The error is occurring in the `test_unescape_html` function when comparing the unescaped html for the input `&a&quot;`. The expected output is `&a"` but the actual output is `&a&quot;`. It seems like the unescaping is not removing the `&quot;` properly.

The potential error location within the function is the `re.sub` method, where the `_htmlentity_transform` method is not properly handling the `&quot;` entity.

The error is occurring because the function is not properly handling the `&quot;` entity and is returning it as is instead of converting it to `"`. It is also not handling other entities properly.

To fix the bug, we need to use the `html` library to unescape the HTML instead of using the `re.sub` method. This will ensure that all HTML entities are correctly unescaped.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import html

def unescapeHTML(s):
    if s is None:
        return None
    return html.unescape(s)
```
