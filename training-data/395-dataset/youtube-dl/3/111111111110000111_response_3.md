The error message indicates that the test case `self.assertEqual(unescapeHTML('&a&quot;'), '&a"')` fails because the unescaped HTML remains the same as the input. This suggests that the `unescapeHTML` function is not properly handling the conversion of HTML entities.

The potential error location in the code is the `re.sub` line where the `unescapeHTML` function tries to substitute HTML entities using a lambda function.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the lambda function used in `re.sub` doesn't properly handle the transformation of the HTML entities.

To fix the bug, we can update the lambda function to properly convert HTML entities to their corresponding characters. Then, use the updated `unescapeHTML` function to correctly handle the conversion of HTML entities.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

# relative function's signature in this file
def _htmlentity_transform(entity_with_semicolon):
    # ... omitted code to transform HTML entities to characters ...
    pass

def unescapeHTML(s):
    if s is None:
        return None
    assert type(s) == str  # changed 'compat_str' to 'str' assuming it's Python 3.x

    return re.sub(
        r'&([^;]+);', lambda m: _htmlentity_transform(m.group(1)), s)
```

With this updated code, the `unescapeHTML` function should correctly handle the conversion of HTML entities and the test case should pass successfully.
