The bug in the provided function "unescapeHTML" is that the import statement for "re" is missing, so the code is unable to use the "re.sub" method.

To fix this bug, the import statement for "re" needs to be added at the beginning of the file. Here's the corrected function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/youtube-dl_3/youtube_dl/utils.py

import re

# relative function's signature in this file
def _htmlentity_transform(entity_with_semicolon):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# this is the corrected and fixed function
def unescapeHTML(s):
    if s is None:
        return None
    assert type(s) == compat_str

    return re.sub(
        r'&([^;]+;)', lambda m: _htmlentity_transform(m.group(1)), s)
```

After adding the import statement for "re", the function should work properly and be able to use the "re.sub" method.
