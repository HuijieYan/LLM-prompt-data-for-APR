The error occurs in the `unescapeHTML` function when trying to unescape the HTML entities. The issue is with the incorrect use of the `_htmlentity_transform` function when processing the input string with HTML entities.

The buggy code seems to be trying to use a regular expression to find HTML entities and replace them using the `_htmlentity_transform` function. However, the `_htmlentity_transform` function is not implemented and the regular expression pattern is incomplete.

To fix the bug, the `_htmlentity_transform` function needs to be implemented to handle the replacement of HTML entities. Additionally, the regular expression pattern needs to be corrected to identify and replace HTML entities properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `unescapeHTML` function:

```python
import re
from html import unescape

def unescapeHTML(s):
    if s is None:
        return None
    assert type(s) == str

    return unescape(s)
```

In this corrected code, the `unescapeHTML` function now uses the `unescape` function from the `html` module, which automatically handles unescaping of HTML entities. This implementation eliminates the need for the `_htmlentity_transform` function and the manual regular expression replacement, resulting in a more robust and reliable solution.
