The bug in the provided code is that the `unescapeHTML` function is not properly defined and contains a mixture of spaces and tabs, making it unclear and potentially causing indentation errors.

To fix this, the `unescapeHTML` function should be properly defined and the indentation should be corrected. Additionally, the `re` module needs to be imported.

Here's the corrected `unescapeHTML` function:

```python
import re

def unescapeHTML(s):
    if s is None:
        return None
    assert isinstance(s, compat_str)

    return re.sub(
        r'&([^;]+;)', lambda m: _htmlentity_transform(m.group(1)), s)
```

With this correction, the function `unescapeHTML` is properly defined and the indentation is consistent. Additionally, the `re` module is imported at the beginning of the file.
