The issue in the code is that the `unescapeHTML` function is not correctly handling HTML entity transformations for certain cases, such as `&quot;` and `&period;`. This is causing the test case `self.assertEqual(unescapeHTML('&a&quot;'), '&a"')` to fail.

To fix this issue, the `unescapeHTML` function needs to be modified to correctly handle these HTML entities. This can be done by using the `html` module from the standard library to unescape HTML entities in the input string.

Here's the corrected code for the `unescapeHTML` function:

```python
import html

def unescapeHTML(s):
    if s is None:
        return None
    assert type(s) == str

    return html.unescape(s)
```

With this modification, the `unescapeHTML` function will correctly handle HTML entities and the test case should pass successfully.
