The error is occurring in the unescapeHTML function, specifically when trying to unescape the HTML entity &quot;. The function is not properly handling this HTML entity.

The function unescapeHTML is intended to unescape HTML entities in a given string. The bug is likely related to the _htmlentity_transform function which is not defined in the provided code.

To fix the bug, we need to properly define the _htmlentity_transform function or use a different approach to unescape the HTML entities.

Here's the corrected unescapeHTML function:

```python
import re

def unescapeHTML(s):
    if s is None:
        return None

    html_entities = {
        'quot': '"',
        'amp': '&',
        'apos': "'",
        'lt': '<',
        'gt': '>'
    }

    return re.sub(
        r'&([^;\s]+);',
        lambda m: html_entities.get(m.group(1), m.group(0)),
        s
    )
```

This corrected function uses a dictionary to map HTML entities to their corresponding characters and uses re.sub to replace the entities in the string.
