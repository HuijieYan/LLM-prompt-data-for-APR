The issue seems to be with the unescapeHTML function, specifically when it encounters the "&a&quot;" string. The function is supposed to unescape HTML entities, but it seems to be failing for certain input strings.

The bug is likely occurring because the function is not handling the HTML entity "&quot;" correctly. It should be converting it to a double quote ("), but it seems to be failing to do so.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the unescapeHTML function to correctly handle the "&quot;" entity and convert it to a double quote.

Here's the corrected code for the unescapeHTML function:

```python
import re

def _htmlentity_transform(entity_with_semicolon):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def unescapeHTML(s):
    if s is None:
        return None
    assert type(s) == compat_str
    
    s = s.replace("&quot;", '"')  # Replace &quot; with "
    return re.sub(
        r'&([^;]+;)', lambda m: _htmlentity_transform(m.group(1)), s)
```

With this modification, the unescapeHTML function should correctly handle the "&quot;" entity and convert it to a double quote. This should resolve the issue seen in the test_unescape_html test case.
