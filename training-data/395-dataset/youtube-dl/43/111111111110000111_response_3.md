The error message from the test function shows that for the URL 'http://media.w3.org/2010/05/sintel/trailer.mp4', the expected output is 'trailer.mp4', but the actual output is an empty string.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the regular expression used in the re.match() function. It seems that the regular expression pattern is not correctly capturing the basename from the URL.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is most likely that the regular expression is not properly matching the URL pattern to extract the basename. It seems that the regular expression is not handling the presence of query parameters or fragments in the URL.

To fix this bug, the regular expression pattern should be adjusted to correctly capture the basename from the given URL, regardless of the presence of query parameters or fragments.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)(?:[?#].*|/?$)', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```
