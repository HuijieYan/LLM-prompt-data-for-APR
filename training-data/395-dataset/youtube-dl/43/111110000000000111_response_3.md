Potential Error:
The potential error in the provided function is the missing import statement for the 're' module. This function is using the 're.match' method, which requires the 're' module to be imported.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurred because the 're' module was not imported, which is necessary for using the 're.match' method.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
The bug can be fixed by adding the import statement for the 're' module at the beginning of the code.

Corrected Code:
```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)/?(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```
By adding the import statement for the 're' module, the provided function should work correctly now.
