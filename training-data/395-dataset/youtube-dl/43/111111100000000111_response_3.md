The bug in the function `url_basename` is that the `re` module is being used, but it has not been imported. Additionally, the `u` prefix is not required for the empty string return.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)/?(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return ''
    return m.group(1)
```
