Potential Error Location: The use of the 're' module without importing it might be causing the error.

Reason for the Bug: The 're' module is used to perform regular expression matching, but it has not been imported before being used in the function.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Import the 're' module at the beginning of the file using `import re`.
2. Use `re.search` instead of `re.match` for a more flexible matching approach.

Corrected Code:
```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.search(r'(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)/?(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```
