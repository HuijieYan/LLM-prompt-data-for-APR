The issue with the provided function is that it is missing the import statement for the 're' module. This results in a NameError when trying to use the 're' module to create the regular expression pattern. To fix this, the 're' module needs to be imported at the beginning of the file.

Here is the corrected code for the url_basename function in the youtube_dl/utils.py file:
```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)/?(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return ''
    return m.group(1)
```
