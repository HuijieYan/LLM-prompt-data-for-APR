The `url_basename` function is intended to extract the basename from a given URL. The error message indicates that for the URL 'http://media.w3.org/2010/05/sintel/trailer.mp4', the function returned an empty string instead of 'trailer.mp4'.

Upon analyzing the code, it appears that the regular expression pattern used in the `url_basename` function is not correctly capturing the basename from the URL. This is the potential error location within the function.

The reason behind the bug is that the regular expression pattern is not matching the URL correctly due to incorrect syntax or missing components.

To fix the bug, the regular expression pattern needs to be modified to correctly capture the basename from the URL. This can be achieved by updating the regular expression pattern to capture the last part of the URL path after the final '/' character.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_basename` function:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)\/\/.+\/(?:[^\/?#]+\/)?([^/?#]+)[/?#]?$', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```

The updated regular expression pattern is designed to capture the last part of the URL path after the final '/' character using '([^/?#]+)'. Additionally, the pattern has been adjusted to correctly handle the optional parts of the URL (such as query parameters and fragments).

This should fix the bug and allow the `url_basename` function to extract the basename from the given URLs correctly.
