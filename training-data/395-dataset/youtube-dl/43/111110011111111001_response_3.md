The error occurs in the `url_basename` function. The function uses the `re` module to perform a regular expression search on the input URL to extract the basename. The bug seems to be that the regular expression is not capturing the correct basename in some cases, leading to failed assertions in the test function.

The potential error location is the regular expression used in the `re.match` function. It is not capturing the basename correctly in all cases, leading to incorrect results.

The bug occurs because the regular expression pattern is not correctly capturing the basename part of the URL. It fails to handle the cases with parameters and anchors in the URL.

To fix the bug, the regular expression pattern needs to be adjusted to accurately capture the basename from different types of URLs. This can be achieved by modifying the regular expression pattern to handle URLs with parameters and anchors.

The corrected code for the `url_basename` function is as follows:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+?)(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```

With the regular expression pattern adjusted to `(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+?)(?:[?#]|$)`, it should now correctly capture the basename from URLs with various formats, including those with parameters and anchors.
