The bug in the code is due to missing import statement for the 're' module. This causes the code to raise a NameError as 're' is not defined. To fix this bug, the required 're' module needs to be imported at the beginning of the script.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/youtube-dl_43/youtube_dl/utils.py

import re  # This line was added to fix the bug

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)/?(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```
