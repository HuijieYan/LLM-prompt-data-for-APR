The potential error in the provided function is that it imports the regular expression module but does not use it within the function. This is why the 're' module is not defined when the function is called, resulting in a NameError.

To fix this bug, the 're' module needs to be imported at the beginning of the function.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)/?(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```
