The test case `test_url_basename` checks for the correctness of the `url_basename` function by passing different URLs and asserting the expected output of the function.

The error message indicates that for the URL `http://media.w3.org/2010/05/sintel/trailer.mp4`, the expected output is `trailer.mp4` but the actual output is an empty string.

The potential error in the `url_basename` function is the regular expression pattern used in the `re.match` function. The pattern is not correctly capturing the basename from the URL.

The reason behind the bug is that the regular expression pattern is not correctly capturing the basename from the URL due to incorrect grouping.

To fix the bug, the regular expression pattern should be corrected to correctly capture the basename from the URL.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_basename` function:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```

With this corrected function, the test cases provided should all pass as expected.
