The potential error location in the `url_basename` function is in the regular expression used in the `re.match` method. The regular expression pattern may not be correctly capturing the basename of the URL.

The bug is occurring because the regular expression `(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)/?(?:[?#]|$)` used in the `url_basename` function is not correctly capturing the basename of the URL. The `re.match` method is not able to find a match for certain URLs, resulting in an empty string being returned, which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we can update the regular expression to correctly capture the basename of the URL. The regular expression can be simplified to directly capture the last segment of the URL following the last slash.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_basename` function:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.search(r'/([^/?#]+)[/?#]?$', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```

With the updated regular expression and using the `re.search` method, the `url_basename` function should now correctly capture the basename of the URL.
