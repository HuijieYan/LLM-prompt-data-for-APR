The error occurs because the function is not correctly extracting the basename from the URL. The regular expression used in the function is the cause of the bug. It fails to capture the basename under certain conditions.

To fix the bug, the regular expression used in the `url_basename` function needs to be modified to correctly capture the basename from the URL.

Updated code for the `url_basename` function:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```

The modification includes changing the pattern in the regular expression to correctly capture the basename from the URL, ensuring that it aligns with the expected behavior in the test cases.
