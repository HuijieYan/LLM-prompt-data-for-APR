Potential Error Location: The regular expression used in the url_basename function may not be capturing the correct group from the URL, leading to incorrect results.

Reason for the Bug: The regular expression is not capturing the correct group from the URL, causing the function to return incorrect basenames.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: We can modify the regular expression to capture the correct group from the URL by adjusting the pattern.

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:\/\/)?[^\/]+\/(?:[^\/?#]+\/)?([^\/?#]+)(?:[\/?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return ''
    return m.group(1)
```

The regular expression in the corrected function has been modified to capture the correct group from the URL. This should resolve the issue and produce the expected results for the test cases.
