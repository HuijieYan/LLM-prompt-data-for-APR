The problem with the provided function is that the 're' module has not been imported. This is evident from the error message at runtime.

The error occurs due to the missing 're' module, which is required for using regular expressions. To fix the bug, the 're' module needs to be imported at the beginning of the file.

Here is the corrected code with the 're' module imported:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)/?(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```
