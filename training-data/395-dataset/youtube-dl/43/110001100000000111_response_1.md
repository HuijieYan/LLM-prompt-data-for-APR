Potential Error Location:
The potential error is occurring in the regular expression used in the re.match() function. 

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The regular expression used does not match the URL format properly, leading to incorrect parsing and extraction of the basename.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the regular expression to correctly match the URL format.
2. Use a different approach to extract the basename from the URL.

Corrected Code:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)(?:\/\/)?[^/]+(?:\/[^\/?#]+)?\/([^\/?#]+).*', url)
    if not m:
        return ''
    return m.group(1)
```
