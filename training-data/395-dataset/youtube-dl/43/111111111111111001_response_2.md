The bug in the `url_basename` function is that the regular expression pattern does not capture the filename from the URL correctly in some cases. This results in the incorrect extraction of the filename.

The function uses the regular expression `r'(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)/?(?:[?#]|$)'` to match and extract the basename from the URL.

The bug occurs because the regular expression pattern is not capturing the correct group for the filename in certain URL formats.

To fix the bug, we need to update the regular expression pattern to correctly capture the filename from the URL. The regular expression pattern should capture the last path component or the part after the last "/" character in the URL.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_basename` function using a more accurate regular expression pattern:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?://)?([^/]+/)*([^/?#]+)', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(2)
```

With this corrected code, the function should be able to extract the basename from the provided URLs accurately, and the test cases should pass without any assertion errors.
