Potential Error: The function is missing the import statement for the 're' module, which is used for regular expressions.

Reason for Bug: The bug is occurring because the 're' module is not imported, so the function is unable to use the 'match' method to perform the regular expression matching.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug: Import the 're' module at the beginning of the code to use the 'match' method for regular expression matching.

Corrected Code:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)/?(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```
