The issue lies within the url_basename function, specifically in its use of the regular expression to extract the basename from the URL.

The bug occurs because the regular expression used in the url_basename function does not properly handle URLs with query parameters or fragments. The current regular expression only captures the last part of the path, but does not account for query parameters or fragments.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the regular expression to properly handle URLs with query parameters and fragments. We can use the following regular expression to achieve this:

```
(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)(?:[?#]|$)
```

This regular expression will correctly extract the basename from the URL, including handling query parameters and fragments.

Here's the corrected code for the url_basename function:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```

With this correction, the function should now properly extract the basename from the URL, and the provided test cases should pass without errors.
