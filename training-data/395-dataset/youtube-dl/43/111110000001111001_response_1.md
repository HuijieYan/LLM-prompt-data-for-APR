The potential error in the given function is that the 're' module has not been imported, which will cause the function to fail as 're' is required for regular expression matching.

To fix this bug, the 're' module needs to be imported at the beginning of the code.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)/?(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return ''
    return m.group(1)
```
