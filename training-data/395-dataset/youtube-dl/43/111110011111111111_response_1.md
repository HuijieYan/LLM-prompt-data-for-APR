The error in the `url_basename` function is that it is not importing the `re` module, which is required for using regular expressions. This is causing the function to fail when trying to use the `re.match` method.

To fix this, the `re` module needs to be imported at the beginning of the file using `import re`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)/?(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```

With the `re` module imported, the function should now work as expected, and the tests should pass without any errors.
