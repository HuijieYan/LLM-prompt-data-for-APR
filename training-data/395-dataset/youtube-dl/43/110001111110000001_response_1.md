The test cases are checking the output of the `url_basename` function against the expected output. The error message indicates that for the URL `http://media.w3.org/2010/05/sintel/trailer.mp4`, the function returned an empty string, while the expected output is `trailer.mp4`.

The potential error in the `url_basename` function is the regular expression pattern used in the `re.match` function. The pattern is not correctly capturing the basename from the URL.

The bug occurred because the regular expression pattern in the `url_basename` function is not capturing the basename correctly. The pattern does not account for URLs that end with a file name and extension, resulting in an empty string being returned.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to update the regular expression pattern to correctly capture the basename from the URL. This can be done by modifying the pattern to handle different URL structures, including those that end with a file name and extension.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_basename` function:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'^(?:https?:|)\/\/[^\/]+\/(?:[^\/?#]+\/)*([^\/?#]+)\/?(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```
