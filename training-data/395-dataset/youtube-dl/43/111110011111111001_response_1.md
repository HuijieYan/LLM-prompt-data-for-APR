The issue with the url_basename function is that it doesn't import the 're' module, which is required for using regular expressions. This leads to a ValueError when calling re.match.

To fix the bug:
1. Import the 're' module at the beginning of the file.
2. Correct the regular expression pattern to capture the basename of the URL.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)\/{2}[^\/]+\/(?:[^/?#]+\/)?([^/?#]+)\/?(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return ''
    return m.group(1)
```

With these changes, the function should work as expected and pass the provided test cases.
