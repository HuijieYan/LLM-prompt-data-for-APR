The issue with the `url_basename` function is that it is missing the import statement for the regular expression (re) module. This is why the function raises a NameError when trying to access the re module.

To fix this issue, we need to add an import statement for the re module at the beginning of the file.

Here is the corrected code for the `url_basename` function:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)/?(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```
