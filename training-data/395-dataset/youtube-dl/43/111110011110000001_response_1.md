The bug in the `url_basename` function is causing it to incorrectly return an empty string instead of the expected basename. The `url` variable is a URL string, and the function tries to extract the name of the last path segment in the URL.

Based on the test cases provided, the bug seems to occur when the URL ends with a slash '/', and the function is failing to extract the last segment of the URL.

To fix the bug in the `url_basename` function, you can modify the regular expression pattern to handle the trailing slash in the URL more accurately.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)*([^/?#]+)/?(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```

With this change, the function should now correctly extract the basename from the given URLs as per the test cases provided.
