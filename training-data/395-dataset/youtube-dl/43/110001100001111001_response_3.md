The bug in the provided function is caused by not importing the `re` module, which is used for regular expressions. This leads to a NameError when trying to use the `re` module to match the URL.

To fix the bug, import the `re` module at the beginning of the file.

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)/?(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```
