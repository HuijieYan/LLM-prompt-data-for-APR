The potential error location within the problematic function is the regular expression used in the `re.match` function. This regular expression is meant to extract the basename of a URL but has a bug causing it to not match the expected values.

The regular expression `(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)/?(?:[?#]|$)` is used to match and extract the basename from a URL. The bug causing the regular expression to fail is related to the `[^/?#]+` part which tries to match characters that are not a slash, question mark, or hash. This does not capture the basename correctly since it doesn't handle cases where no query string or fragment is present in the URL.

To fix the bug, the regular expression needs to be modified to account for these cases. It should also handle the case where there can be a trailing slash at the end of the URL.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_basename` function:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)?/?(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```
