1. The test cases are comparing the output of the `url_basename` function with expected values. The error message indicates that the function is returning an empty string when it should be returning "trailer.mp4".

2. The potential error location within the `url_basename` function is the regular expression pattern used in the `re.match` function.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the regular expression pattern might not be capturing the correct part of the URL to extract the basename.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Reviewing and updating the regular expression pattern to ensure that it captures the correct part of the URL.
   - Using a different method (e.g., parsing the URL using a library) to extract the basename from the URL.

5. Corrected code for the `url_basename` function:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)(?:\/\/[^/]+)?/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)/?(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```

In the corrected code, the regular expression pattern has been updated to capture the correct part of the URL. Additionally, the regular expression now accommodates for optional protocol and domain in the URL.
