The potential error in the provided function is in the regex pattern used to match and extract the basename from the URL. The regex pattern might not be correctly capturing the basename from the URL, leading to the incorrect output and failing test cases.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the regex pattern is not correctly capturing the basename from the URL, resulting in the function returning an empty string for some URLs, and the incorrect basename for others.

To fix the bug, the regex pattern needs to be updated to correctly capture the basename from the URL.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'^(?:https?:\/\/)?(?:[^\/]+\/)*([^\/?#]+)', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```

With the corrected regex pattern, the function should now correctly extract the basename from the URL and return the expected results for the test cases provided.
