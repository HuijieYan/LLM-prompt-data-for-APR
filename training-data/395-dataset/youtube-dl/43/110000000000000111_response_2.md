The potential error in the provided function is the missing import statement for the 're' module. This is indicated by the reference to 're.match' in the function body.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the 're' module is not imported before using the 're.match' method.

To fix the bug, the 're' module needs to be imported at the beginning of the code.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)/?(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return ''
    return m.group(1)
```
