Potential Error:
The potential error in the code is that the "re" module (regular expression) is used without importing the module at the beginning of the code.

Reason behind the Bug:
The "re" module needs to be imported to use the `re.match` function. Since it is not imported, the code will result in an error.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Import the "re" module at the beginning of the code using `import re`.
2. Ensure that the regular expression pattern used in the `re.match` function is correctly capturing the desired string from the URL.

Corrected Code:
```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)/?(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return ''
    return m.group(1)
```
