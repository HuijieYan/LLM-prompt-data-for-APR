The potential error location within the problematic function is the regular expression used in the `url_basename` function. 

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the regular expression is not correctly capturing the basename of the URL. It fails to extract the last part of the URL after the last '/'.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the regular expression to correctly capture the basename of the URL.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)/?(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return ''
    return m.group(1)
```

With this modification, the `url_basename` function should now correctly extract the basename of the URL as intended.
