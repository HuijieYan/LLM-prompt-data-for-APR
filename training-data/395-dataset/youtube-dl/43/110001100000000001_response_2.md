Potential Error:
The function is using the 're' module to perform a regular expression match, but the 're' module has not been imported in the code. This is likely causing the error.

Reason for the Bug:
The 're' module needs to be imported in order to use the `re.match` function.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Import the 're' module at the beginning of the file.
2. Use the `re.match` function correctly with the proper regular expression pattern.

Corrected Code:
```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)/?(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```
