The potential error location within the problematic function is the regular expression in the re.match() function. This regular expression is used to match and extract the last part of the URL, but it is not correctly capturing the last part of the URL in all cases.

The bug occurs because the regular expression in the re.match() function is not capturing the last part of the URL correctly, hence causing the function to return an empty string.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the regular expression to properly capture the last part of the URL.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)\/\/[^\/]+\/(?:[^/?#]+\/)*([^/?#]+)\/?(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```
