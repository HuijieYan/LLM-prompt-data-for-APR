The bug in the `url_basename` function is likely in the regular expression pattern used in `re.match`. The function is expected to extract the last part of the path from a URL, but it's not handling all cases correctly.

The reason for the bug is that the regular expression pattern is not accounting for the presence of query parameters (`?x=y`) or fragments (`#x=y`) in the URL.

To fix the bug, the regular expression pattern should be updated to handle these cases as well. Additionally, the function should import the `re` module to use regular expressions.

Here's the corrected code for the `url_basename` function:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)\/\/[^\/]+(?:\/[^?#]+)*\/?([^\/?#]+)[\/?#]?', url)
    if not m:
        return ''
    return m.group(1)
```

With this updated regular expression pattern, the function should be able to correctly extract the last part of the path from a URL, accounting for query parameters and fragments.
