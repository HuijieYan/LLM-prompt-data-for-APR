The potential error in the provided function is the missing import statement for the `re` module. This is evident from the fact that the function directly uses the `re` module method `match`, but the module is not imported anywhere in the code.

The error occurs because the code is trying to use the `re` module to perform a regular expression match without importing it first. The `re` module is Python's built-in module for working with regular expressions, so it needs to be imported before it can be used.

To fix this bug, we need to import the `re` module at the beginning of the code.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re

def url_basename(url):
    m = re.match(r'(?:https?:|)//[^/]+/(?:[^/?#]+/)?([^/?#]+)/?(?:[?#]|$)', url)
    if not m:
        return u''
    return m.group(1)
```

This code fixes the bug by importing the `re` module at the beginning of the code. Now the function should work as expected without any errors.
