The potential error in the `build_format_selector` function is due to the missing import statement for the `collections` module. Additionally, the function is trying to use the `collections.namedtuple` without importing it first. This is causing the `NameError` when `collections.namedtuple` is used.

To fix the bug, the `collections` module needs to be imported at the beginning of the file. Also, to use `namedtuple`, it has to be imported explicitly.

Here's the corrected code for the `build_format_selector` function with the necessary imports included:

```python
import collections
import io
import itertools
import tokenize
from youtube_dl.compat import compat_tokenize_tokenize

# ... (other import statements) ...

class YoutubeDL(object):
    """
    YoutubeDL class.
    """
    # ... (other code) ...

    # this is the corrected and complete build_format_selector function
    def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
        def syntax_error(note, start):
            message = (
                'Invalid format specification: '
                '{0}\n\t{1}\n\t{2}^'.format(note, format_spec, ' ' * start[1]))
            return SyntaxError(message)

        # rest of the function remains the same
```

With these changes, the issue with the missing import for `collections` should be resolved.
