Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is within the function "build_format_selector" where the SyntaxError is being raised. 

Reasons behind the Bug:
The error is occurring because the function is trying to raise a SyntaxError using the syntax_error function, which is not defined in the current scope. The code is attempting to call syntax_error function without any reference to it, which is causing the error.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Import the syntax_error function from another module if it exists.
2. Define the syntax_error function within the current scope to avoid the undefined function error.

Corrected Code:
```python
# this is the corrected build_format_selector function
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    def _syntax_error(note, start):
        message = (
            'Invalid format specification: '
            '{0}\n\t{1}\n\t{2}^'.format(note, format_spec, ' ' * start[1]))
        return SyntaxError(message)

    # rest of the function remains the same...
```
