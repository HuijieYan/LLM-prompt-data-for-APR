The error in the given function `build_format_selector` is likely to be due to the use of undefined variables and/or missing imports.

Potential Issues:
1. The function uses a collection named `collections`, but it is not imported in the function definition.
2. The function uses the `SyntaxError` class, but it is not imported in the function definition.
3. The library `compat_tokenize_tokenize` is used in the function, but it is not imported in the function definition.

Approaches to Fix the Bug:
1. Import the `collections` module at the beginning of the file using `import collections`.
2. Import the `SyntaxError` class at the beginning of the file using `from exceptions import SyntaxError`.
3. Import the `compat_tokenize_tokenize` function from the appropriate module or define it within the script.

Here's the corrected function with the necessary imports:

```python
import collections
import io
import itertools
import tokenize
from exceptions import SyntaxError  # or specific module where SyntaxError is defined

class YoutubeDL(object):
    # ... other methods ...

    def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
        def syntax_error(note, start):
            message = (
                'Invalid format specification: '
                '{0}\n\t{1}\n\t{2}^'.format(note, format_spec, ' ' * start[1]))
            return SyntaxError(message)

        PICKFIRST = 'PICKFIRST'
        MERGE = 'MERGE'
        SINGLE = 'SINGLE'
        GROUP = 'GROUP'
        FormatSelector = collections.namedtuple('FormatSelector', ['type', 'selector', 'filters'])

        # Rest of the code remains unchanged...
```

In the corrected code, the necessary import statements have been added at the beginning of the file to resolve the potential issues. This should fix the bug in the `build_format_selector` function.
