Potential error location: The potential error is in the `build_format_selector` method where the `syntax_error` function is being called. 

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: 
The `syntax_error` function is being called without being defined within the `build_format_selector` method.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define the `syntax_error` function within the `build_format_selector` method.
2. Ensure that the `syntax_error` function is accessible within the scope of the `build_format_selector` method.

Corrected code:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    def syntax_error(note, start):
        message = (
            'Invalid format specification: '
            '{0}\n\t{1}\n\t{2}^'.format(note, format_spec, ' ' * start[1]))
        raise SyntaxError(message)
        
    PICKFIRST = 'PICKFIRST'
    MERGE = 'MERGE'
    SINGLE = 'SINGLE'
    GROUP = 'GROUP'
    FormatSelector = collections.namedtuple('FormatSelector', ['type', 'selector', 'filters'])

    # rest of the code remains the same
```
