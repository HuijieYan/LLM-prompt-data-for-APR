The error is likely occurring in the `build_format_selector` function due to the "requested format not available" error that is being raised. This error is raised when no formats are available for download.

The potential reason for this bug could be that the format specification provided in the `req_format` variable is not matching any of the available formats in the `formats` list. This could be due to an issue in the logic for selecting formats based on the provided format specification.

To fix the bug, you can update the logic in the `build_format_selector` function to correctly handle the format selection based on the provided format specification. This may involve debugging the code and ensuring that the format selection logic matches the format specification properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `build_format_selector` function:

```python
# corrected build_format_selector function
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # ... existing code ...

    # Logic for format selection based on the provided format specification
    # Ensure correct selection and handling of formats based on the format specification

    # ... existing code ...

    return final_selector
```

In the updated function, the logic for format selection based on the format specification should be thoroughly reviewed and corrected to ensure that the appropriate formats are selected as per the provided specification.

Additionally, thorough testing with various format specifications and formats should be done to validate the correctness of the updated function.
