The error in the `build_format_selector` function is likely to occur due to the usage of undeclared variables and methods. In Python, the `restore_last_token` method is not defined within the given class, and the `collections` module has not been imported.

To fix the issue, the `collections` module needs to be imported to use the `namedtuple` class, and the `restore_last_token` method needs to be defined within the class.

The corrected code for the `build_format_selector` function can be as follows:

```python
import collections
import io
import tokenize
import itertools

class YoutubeDL(object):
    # ... (other methods and class variables)

    def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
        # existing code as it is

        # new definition for TokenIterator and restore_last_token method
        class TokenIterator(object):
            def __init__(self, tokens):
                self.tokens = tokens
                self.counter = 0

            def __iter__(self):
                return self

            def __next__(self):
                if self.counter >= len(self.tokens):
                    raise StopIteration()
                value = self.tokens[self.counter]
                self.counter += 1
                return value

            def restore_last_token(self):
                self.counter -= 1

        # other existing code remains unchanged
```

By adding the `collections` import statement and defining the `TokenIterator` class with the `restore_last_token` method, the code should now work as intended.

This should resolve the syntax error and allow the `build_format_selector` method to function correctly. Additionally, other potential issues within the function would need to be addressed for comprehensive error handling and accurate format selection logic.
