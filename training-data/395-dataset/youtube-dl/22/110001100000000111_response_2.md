The issue seems to be related to the `--match-filter` option in youtube-dl not correctly parsing and matching the values for uploader and uploader_id, particularly when they contain spaces or hyphens.

The potential error location within the `parse_filesize` function in the `youtube_dl/utils.py` file.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug are:
1. The regular expression used to parse the `filter_part` in the `_match_one` function may not be correctly handling the spaces or hyphens in the uploader and uploader_id values.
2. The comparison and matching logic for the uploader and uploader_id values may not be considering the presence of spaces or hyphens.

To fix the bug, the regular expressions used to parse the `filter_part` should be updated to handle spaces and hyphens in the values. Additionally, the comparison and matching logic should be modified to handle these characters as well.

Here's the corrected code for the `_match_one` function:

```python
def _match_one(filter_part, dct):
    # ... (other code omitted) ...

    # updated regular expression to handle spaces and hyphens in the key and values
    operator_rex = re.compile(r'''(?x)\s*
        (?P<key>[a-z_]+)
        \s*(?P<op>%s)(?P<none_inclusive>\s*\?)?\s*
        (?:
            (?P<intval>[0-9.]+(?:[kKmMgGtTpPeEzZyY]i?[Bb]?)?)|
            (?P<strval>[a-z0-9A-Z \-]*)
        )
        \s*$ 
        ''' % '|'.join(map(re.escape, COMPARISON_OPERATORS.keys())))
    m = operator_rex.search(filter_part)

    # ... (remaining code will remain the same) ...
```

With these changes, the `_match_one` function should now correctly handle spaces and hyphens in the uploader and uploader_id values.
