The error message suggests that there is an issue with the filter part `"uploader = "變態妍字幕版 太妍 тест""`. This could be due to the space and double quotes within the uploader value. The function `_match_one` is responsible for parsing and matching the filter part with the input dictionary. The error occurs when the filter part is being processed.

The bug occurs because the filter part contains spaces and quotes within the value, causing the regular expression to match incorrectly. This leads to the ValueError being raised as the filter part is considered invalid.

A possible approach to fixing this bug is to modify the regular expression pattern in `_match_one` to handle spaces and quotes within the filter part more effectively. Additionally, it might be necessary to handle special characters such as double quotes and spaces when matching the filter part with the input dictionary.

The corrected code for the `_match_one` function is as follows:

```python
import operator
import re

def _match_one(filter_part, dct):
    # ... existing code ...

    operator_rex = re.compile(r'''(?x)\s*
        (?P<key>[a-z_]+)
        \s*(?P<op>%s)(?P<none_inclusive>\s*\?)?\s*
        (?P<value>"[^"]+"|\S+)
        \s*$''' % '|'.join(map(re.escape, COMPARISON_OPERATORS.keys())))

    m = operator_rex.search(filter_part)
    if m:
        op = COMPARISON_OPERATORS[m.group('op')]
        actual_value = dct.get(m.group('key'))
        comparison_value = m.group('value').strip('"')
        # rest of the code remains the same
        # ...

    # ... rest of the existing code ...

    # modified regular expression and handling of value
```

This updated regex pattern now includes the capture of the value part within quotes and strips the quotes from the captured value. This change enables the function to handle filter parts with spaces and quotes more effectively.
