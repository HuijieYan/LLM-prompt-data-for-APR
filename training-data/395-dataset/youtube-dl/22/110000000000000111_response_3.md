The issue seems to be with the function `_match_one` in the provided code, where it fails to correctly handle the filters for the uploader and uploader_id.

The `operator_rex` regular expressions and matching logic seem to be the potential error location within the `_match_one` function.

The bug occurs because the regular expressions and matching logic are not correctly identifying and processing the filter parts for uploader and uploader_id.

To fix the bug, the regular expressions and matching logic should be updated to correctly identify and process the filter parts for uploader and uploader_id.

Here's the corrected code for the `_match_one` function:

```python
def _match_one(filter_part, dct):
    COMPARISON_OPERATORS = {
        '<': operator.lt,
        '<=': operator.le,
        '>': operator.gt,
        '>=': operator.ge,
        '=': operator.eq,
        '!=': operator.ne,
    }
    UNARY_OPERATORS = {
        '': lambda v: v is not None,
        '!': lambda v: v is None,
    }

    op_key_rex = re.compile(r'(?P<op>[!<=>]{,2})\s*(?P<key>[a-z_]+)')
    m = op_key_rex.search(filter_part)
    if m:
        op = m.group('op')
        key = m.group('key')
        
        actual_value = dct.get(key)

        if op in ('', '!'):
            return UNARY_OPERATORS[op](dct.get(key))

        val = re.sub(r'.*\?', '', filter_part).strip()
        if val.startswith(('\'', '\"')):
            val = val[1:-1]
        
        if key in dct:
            if op in COMPARISON_OPERATORS:
                return COMPARISON_OPERATORS[op](dct[key], val)
    raise ValueError('Invalid filter part %r' % filter_part)
```

This corrected code uses a new regular expression to correctly identify the comparison operator and the key. It then processes the filter appropriately based on the identified operator and key.
