The test case provided is a unit test for the `_match_one` function. The error message indicates that the function is raising a `ValueError` with the message "Invalid filter part". This suggests that the function is encountering an invalid filter part during its execution.

The potential error location within the `_match_one` function is likely to be in the block that handles the parsing of the filter part and the comparison of values.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely due to the improper parsing or comparison of the filter parts in the function. The function is not handling the input filter parts correctly, leading to an invalid comparison or parsing.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to review the parsing and comparison logic in the `_match_one` function and ensure that it properly handles different types of filter parts, such as string values, comparison operators, and unary operators.

Here's the corrected code for the `_match_one` function:

```python
import operator
import re

def _match_one(filter_part, dct):
    # Define comparison and unary operators
    COMPARISON_OPERATORS = {
        '<': operator.lt,
        '<=': operator.le,
        '>': operator.gt,
        '>=': operator.ge,
        '=': operator.eq,
        '!=': operator.ne,
    }
    UNARY_OPERATORS = {
        '': lambda v: v is not None,
        '!': lambda v: v is None,
    }

    # Parse the filter part using regular expression
    operator_rex = re.compile(r'''(?x)\s*
        (?P<key>[a-z_]+)
        \s*(?P<op>[<>=!]+)\s*\??
        \s*(?P<value>["'].*?["']|\d+\.?\d*)
        \s*$''')

    m = operator_rex.search(filter_part)
    if m:
        key = m.group('key')
        op = m.group('op')
        value = m.group('value')

        # Handle unary operators
        if op in UNARY_OPERATORS:
            return UNARY_OPERATORS[op](dct.get(key))

        # Handle comparison operators
        if op in COMPARISON_OPERATORS:
            # Convert string value to int if possible
            try:
                comparison_value = int(value)
            except ValueError:
                comparison_value = value

            actual_value = dct.get(key)
            if actual_value is None:
                return op != '=' # Handle none_inclusive

            return COMPARISON_OPERATORS[op](actual_value, comparison_value)

    raise ValueError('Invalid filter part %r' % filter_part)
```

In the corrected code, I've updated the parsing and comparison logic to properly handle the filter parts. The function now correctly parses the key, operator, and value, and performs the comparison with the dictionary values based on the operator. It also handles unary operators and invalid filter parts correctly. This should address the issue of encountering an "Invalid filter part" error.
