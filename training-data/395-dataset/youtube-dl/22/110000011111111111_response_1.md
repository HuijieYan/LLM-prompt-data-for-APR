The issue seems to be related to the handling of filter parts related to the uploader field, especially when the uploader's name contains special characters, spaces, or quotes. The current implementation of the `_match_one` function does not handle these cases properly, leading to the ValueError: 'Invalid filter part' error.

The potential error location is within the `_match_one` function, specifically in the part where it processes filter parts related to the uploader field.

The bug is occurring because the regular expression used to parse the filter parts does not handle special characters, spaces, or quotes in the uploader's name properly. This causes the function to raise a ValueError when trying to process these filter parts.

To fix the bug, the regular expression used to parse the filter parts needs to be modified to properly handle special characters, spaces, and quotes in the uploader's name. Additionally, the function should handle string values with special characters or spaces in a way that avoids the ValueError.

The corrected code for the `_match_one` function is as follows:

```python
import re
import operator

def _match_one(filter_part, dct):
    COMPARISON_OPERATORS = {
        '<': operator.lt,
        '<=': operator.le,
        '>': operator.gt,
        '>=': operator.ge,
        '=': operator.eq,
        '!=': operator.ne,
    }
    operator_rex = re.compile(r'''(?x)\s*
        (?P<key>[a-z_]+)
        \s*(?P<op>%s)(?P<none_inclusive>\s*\?)?\s*
        (?P<strval>"[^"]*"|'[^']*'|\S+)
        \s*$
        ''' % '|'.join(map(re.escape, COMPARISON_OPERATORS.keys())))
    m = operator_rex.search(filter_part)
    if m:
        op = COMPARISON_OPERATORS[m.group('op')]
        actual_value = dct.get(m.group('key'))
        comparison_value = m.group('strval').strip('\'"')
        if actual_value is None:
            return m.group('none_inclusive')
        return op(actual_value, comparison_value)

    UNARY_OPERATORS = {
        '': lambda v: v is not None,
        '!': lambda v: v is None,
    }
    operator_rex = re.compile(r'''(?x)\s*
        (?P<op>%s)\s*(?P<key>[a-z_]+)
        \s*$
        ''' % '|'.join(map(re.escape, UNARY_OPERATORS.keys())))
    m = operator_rex.search(filter_part)
    if m:
        op = UNARY_OPERATORS[m.group('op')]
        actual_value = dct.get(m.group('key'))
        return op(actual_value)

    raise ValueError('Invalid filter part %r' % filter_part)
```
In the corrected code, the regular expression for parsing the filter parts now includes a group for matching string values enclosed in single or double quotes, as well as non-quoted string values. This modification allows proper handling of special characters, spaces, and quotes in the uploader's name. Additionally, when extracting the comparison value, the code properly strips the enclosing quotes and handles the comparison with the extracted value.
