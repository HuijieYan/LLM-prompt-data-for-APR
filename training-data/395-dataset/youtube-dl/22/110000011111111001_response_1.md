The error occurs because the regular expression used in the `_match_one` function to parse comparison filter parts does not handle quoted strings properly.

The buggy function `_match_one` is used to match individual filter parts of a query. The function tries to parse the filter part and apply the comparison operation. The error occurs when the filter part contains a quoted string, such as in the case of `uploader = "變態妍字幕版 太妍 тест"`. The regular expression used to parse the filter parts does not properly handle the quoted strings, leading to a ValueError due to an invalid filter part.

To fix the issue, the regular expression in the `_match_one` function needs to be adjusted to handle quoted strings properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_match_one` function:

```python
import re
import operator

def _match_one(filter_part, dct):
    COMPARISON_OPERATORS = {
        '<': operator.lt,
        '<=': operator.le,
        '>': operator.gt,
        '>=': operator.ge,
        '=': operator.eq,
        '!=': operator.ne,
    }
    DOUBLE_QUOTED_STRING_RE = r'"[^"\\]*(?:\\.[^"\\]*)*"'
    SINGLE_QUOTED_STRING_RE = r"'[^'\\]*(?:\\.[^'\\]*)*'"
    operator_rex = re.compile(r'''(?x)\s*
        (?P<key>[a-z_]+)
        \s*(?P<op>%s)(?P<none_inclusive>\s*\?)?\s*
        (?:
            (?P<intval>[0-9.]+(?:[kKmMgGtTpPeEzZyY]i?[Bb]?)?)|
            (?P<strval>%s)|(?P<strval>%s)
        )
        \s*$''' % ('|'.join(map(re.escape, COMPARISON_OPERATORS.keys())), DOUBLE_QUOTED_STRING_RE, SINGLE_QUOTED_STRING_RE))
    m = operator_rex.search(filter_part)
    # ... rest of the function remains unchanged
```

In the corrected code, the regular expression `operator_rex` now includes patterns to match double-quoted and single-quoted strings in addition to the original patterns. This allows the function to properly handle comparison filter parts containing quoted strings.

After applying this fix, the function should be able to handle comparison filter parts with quoted strings without raising a ValueError.
