The issue seems to be with the `_match_one` function that is not correctly handling the filter expressions provided, leading to incorrect comparisons and incorrect results.

The function is intended to match filter expressions and perform comparisons based on the provided expressions. The issue seems to be related to how the function handles different comparison operations and values.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the handling of comparison operations and values, especially when dealing with strings and special characters.

The bug is likely occurring due to incorrect parsing and handling of comparison values and operations. The function is not properly differentiating between different types of comparison values (strings, integers, special characters) and not handling them appropriately.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to correctly parse and handle different comparison values. This could involve improving the regular expressions used for parsing, as well as adding proper logic to handle different types of comparison values.

Here's the corrected code for the `_match_one` function:

```python
def _match_one(filter_part, dct):
    # ... previous code ...

    operator_rex = re.compile(r'''(?x)\s*
        (?P<key>[a-z_]+)
        \s*(?P<op><|<=|>|>=|=?=|!=)(?P<none_inclusive>\s*\?)?\s*
        (?P<value>.+)
        \s*$''')
    m = operator_rex.search(filter_part)
    if m:
        op = COMPARISON_OPERATORS[m.group('op')]
        actual_value = dct.get(m.group('key'))
        comparison_value = m.group('value')
        if m.group('value').isnumeric():
            comparison_value = int(comparison_value)
        else:
            comparison_value = comparison_value.strip('"')  # Remove quotes
        if actual_value is None:
            return m.group('none_inclusive')
        return op(actual_value, comparison_value)

    # ... remaining code ...
```

This corrected code improves the regular expression pattern for parsing the filter expressions and correctly handles different types of comparison values. The function now ensures that the comparison values are parsed and handled appropriately based on their data type. Additionally, it removes any surrounding quotes for string comparison values.

These changes should address the issues with incorrect comparisons and result in the correct behavior for the `_match_one` function.
