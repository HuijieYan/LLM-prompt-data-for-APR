The bug occurs in the `_match_one` function. The function is designed to parse and apply a filter on a dictionary, but it is not handling all cases properly, leading to incorrect comparisons and errors.

The main issue seems to be with the parsing of comparison values from the input string. The function is not handling different types of comparison values, such as strings and numbers, and is not properly validating the comparison operator and type of value.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to properly handle different types of comparison values and comparison operators. Additionally, it should ensure that the comparison is performed correctly based on the data type of the values being compared.

Here is the corrected code for the `_match_one` function:

```python
def _match_one(filter_part, dct):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # Corrected code
    def parse_comparison_value(value):
        # Try to parse the value as an integer
        try:
            return int(value)
        except ValueError:
            pass
        
        # Try to parse the value as a filesize
        parsed_value = parse_filesize(value)
        if parsed_value is not None:
            return parsed_value
        
        # If all else fails, return the value as a string
        return value

    m = operator_rex.search(filter_part)
    if m:
        op = COMPARISON_OPERATORS.get(m.group('op'))
        if op:
            actual_value = dct.get(m.group('key'))
            comparison_value = parse_comparison_value(m.group('intval') or m.group('strval'))
            if actual_value is None:
                return m.group('none_inclusive')
            return op(actual_value, comparison_value)
    
    # ... rest of the code ...
```

In the corrected code, a new function `parse_comparison_value` is introduced to handle the parsing of comparison values. It first tries to parse the value as an integer, then as a filesize using the `parse_filesize` function, and finally falls back to treating the value as a string if neither of the previous attempts succeed. This way, the comparison values are parsed and handled accurately.

It's important to note that the above code is a partial correction and does not cover all possible cases. Additional testing and handling of edge cases may be required to fully resolve the issue.
