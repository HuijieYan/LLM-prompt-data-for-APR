The error message indicates that there is an issue with the "uploader = "變態妍字幕版 太妍 тест"" filter in the test function. It seems that the filter part is not being parsed correctly, leading to a ValueError: "Invalid filter part 'uploader = "變態妍字幕版 太妍 тест"'" in the function `_match_one`.

The potential error location within the function is in the regex pattern matching and the subsequent parsing of the filter parts.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the regular expression pattern may not be handling the filter part "uploader = "變態妍字幕版 太妍 тест"" properly, and the parsing logic does not account for this kind of input.

To fix the bug, the regular expression pattern needs to be updated to handle the filter parts correctly, especially those with spaces and non-ASCII characters. Additionally, the parsing logic needs to be improved to correctly handle the comparison values.

Here's the corrected code for the `_match_one` function:

```python
import re
import operator


def parse_filesize(s):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass


def _match_one(filter_part, dct):
    COMPARISON_OPERATORS = {
        '<': operator.lt,
        '<=': operator.le,
        '>': operator.gt,
        '>=': operator.ge,
        '=': operator.eq,
        '!=': operator.ne,
    }
    operator_rex = re.compile(r'''(?x)\s*
        (?P<key>[a-z_]+)
        \s*(?P<op>%s)(?P<none_inclusive>\s*\?)?\s*
        (?:
            (?P<intval>[0-9.]+(?:[kKmMgGtTpPeEzZyY]i?[Bb]?)?)|
            (?P<strval>.+)
        )
        \s*$
        ''' % '|'.join(map(re.escape, COMPARISON_OPERATORS.keys())))
    m = operator_rex.search(filter_part)
    if m:
        op = COMPARISON_OPERATORS[m.group('op')]
        actual_value = dct.get(m.group('key'))
        comparison_value = m.group('strval')
        
        if actual_value is None:
            return m.group('none_inclusive')
        return op(actual_value, comparison_value)

    UNARY_OPERATORS = {
        '': lambda v: v is not None,
        '!': lambda v: v is None,
    }
    operator_rex = re.compile(r'''(?x)\s*
        (?P<op>%s)\s*(?P<key>[a-z_]+)
        \s*$
        ''' % '|'.join(map(re.escape, UNARY_OPERATORS.keys())))
    m = operator_rex.search(filter_part)
    if m:
        op = UNARY_OPERATORS[m.group('op')]
        actual_value = dct.get(m.group('key'))
        return op(actual_value)

    raise ValueError('Invalid filter part %r' % filter_part)
```

This corrected code includes a more general regular expression pattern for parsing the filter parts, ensuring that it can handle non-ASCII characters and spaces. Additionally, the comparison value is directly extracted as a string, rather than distinguishing between string and integer values.

This should address the parsing issue and prevent the ValueError when handling filter parts with spaces and special characters.
