The error is occurring in the `_match_one` function. It seems that the regular expression used for parsing the filter expression is not correctly handling the comparison operator and the values associated with it.

The potential error location is in the regular expression parsing part of the `_match_one` function, specifically in how it handles the comparison operator and the values.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the regular expression is not capturing the comparison operator and the values correctly, leading to incorrect parsing of the filter expression.

To fix the bug, the regular expression for parsing the filter expression should be adjusted to capture the comparison operator and the values properly. Additionally, the comparison logic needs to be corrected to ensure that the comparisons are handled appropriately.

Here's the corrected `_match_one` function:

```python
import operator
import re

def _match_one(filter_part, dct):
    COMPARISON_OPERATORS = {
        '<': operator.lt,
        '<=': operator.le,
        '>': operator.gt,
        '>=': operator.ge,
        '=': operator.eq,
        '!=': operator.ne,
    }
    m = re.match(r'\s*([a-z_]+)\s*(<|<=|>|>=|=|!=)\s*(.*?)\s*$', filter_part)
    if m:
        key = m.group(1)
        op = COMPARISON_OPERATORS[m.group(2)]
        comparison_value = m.group(3)
        actual_value = dct.get(key)
        if actual_value is None:
            return False if op in (operator.eq, operator.le, operator.ge) else True
        try:
            if '.' in comparison_value:
                comparison_value = float(comparison_value)
            else:
                comparison_value = int(comparison_value)
        except ValueError:
            raise ValueError(f'Invalid comparison value {comparison_value} in filter part {filter_part}')
    
        return op(actual_value, comparison_value)

    UNARY_OPERATORS = {
        '': lambda v: v is not None,
        '!': lambda v: v is None,
    }
    m = re.match(r'\s*(\!)?([a-z_]+)\s*$', filter_part)
    if m:
        op = UNARY_OPERATORS[m.group(1) or '']
        actual_value = dct.get(m.group(2))
        return op(actual_value)

    raise ValueError('Invalid filter part %r' % filter_part)
```

With these corrections, the function should now handle the filter expressions properly and prevent the ValueError mentioned in the error message.
