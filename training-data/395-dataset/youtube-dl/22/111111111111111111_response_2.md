The error seems to be occurring in the function `_match_one` in the `youtube_dl/utils.py` file. The error is a `ValueError` with the message "Invalid filter part". This error is raised when processing the filter part `uploader = "變態妍字幕版 太妍 тест"`.

The reason for the error is that the filter part is not being processed correctly in the function `_match_one`. It seems that the regular expression pattern used to parse the filter part might not be handling non-ASCII characters and special characters properly. This is likely causing the function to raise a `ValueError` when encountering the filter part with non-ASCII characters.

To fix this issue, the regular expression pattern used to parse the filter part should be updated to correctly handle non-ASCII characters and special characters. Additionally, the comparison value extraction logic should be reviewed to ensure it correctly captures the comparison value from the filter part.

Here's the corrected code for the `_match_one` function in `youtube_dl/utils.py`:

```python
def _match_one(filter_part, dct):
    # Existing code...

    # Update the regular expression pattern to handle non-ASCII characters and special characters
    operator_rex = re.compile(r'''(?x)\s*
        (?P<key>[a-z_]+)
        \s*(?P<op>%s)(?P<none_inclusive>\s*\?)?\s*
        (?:
            (?P<intval>[0-9.]+(?:[kKmMgGtTpPeEzZyY]i?[Bb]?)?)|
            (?P<strval>(?![0-9.])[a-z0-9A-Z\s'"]*)
        )
        \s*$
        ''' % '|'.join(map(re.escape, COMPARISON_OPERATORS.keys())))
    # Existing code...
```

By updating the regular expression pattern to handle non-ASCII characters and special characters, the function should be able to correctly parse the filter part without raising a `ValueError`.

After making this change, the function should be able to properly process filter parts with non-ASCII characters and special characters, resolving the `ValueError` issue.

Please note that this fix assumes that the use of non-ASCII characters and special characters in filter parts is intentional and allowed in the context of the `youtube-dl` functionality. It's important to validate this assumption before applying the fix.
