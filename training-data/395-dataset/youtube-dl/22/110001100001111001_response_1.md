The buggy function `_match_one` has multiple issues. It is attempting to parse filter strings that represent comparison operations and apply those filters to the given dictionary `dct`. However, there are multiple errors in the logic and structure of the function. 

The code is attempting to handle comparison operations and values as strings and numbers, including file sizes and different string comparisons. The function uses regular expressions to parse the filter string, and then it applies the comparison operation based on the parsed values.

The issues with the code are:
1. The handling of different comparison types (string, numerical, file size) is convoluted and prone to errors.
2. The use of regular expressions for parsing comparisons is not efficient and can result in incorrect parsing.
3. The code does not handle the potential exceptions that may arise during parsing and comparison.

To fix the function:
1. Simplify the comparison parsing logic to handle only numerical comparisons initially.
2. Use explicit conditionals to handle different types of comparisons (string, numerical).
3. Use try-except blocks to handle potential parsing errors, such as when parsing file sizes.
4. Consider refactoring the function to improve readability and maintainability.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import operator
import re

def _match_one(filter_part, dct):
    parts = re.split(r'(<|<=|>|>=|=|!=)\s*(.*?)\s*$', filter_part)

    if len(parts) != 4:
        raise ValueError('Invalid filter part %r' % filter_part)

    key = parts[0]
    op = parts[1]
    comparison_value = parts[2]

    actual_value = dct.get(key)
    if actual_value is None:
        return bool(op)  # Return True for existence checks

    try:
        comparison_value = int(comparison_value)
    except ValueError:
        # If comparison_value is not an int, treat it as a string
        comparison_value = comparison_value

    if op == '<':
        return actual_value < comparison_value
    elif op == '<=':
        return actual_value <= comparison_value
    elif op == '>':
        return actual_value > comparison_value
    elif op == '>=':
        return actual_value >= comparison_value
    elif op == '=':
        return actual_value == comparison_value
    elif op == '!=':
        return actual_value != comparison_value

    raise ValueError('Invalid filter part %r' % filter_part)
```
