The bug is caused by the "Invalid filter part" error when trying to match the "uploader = 'John Sucks at Video Games'" filter. This error occurs when the function `_match_one(filter_part, dct)` is called.

The error is likely occurring due to some discrepancy in parsing the filter string or extracting the relevant values from the `dct` dictionary for comparison.

To fix the bug, the parsing and comparison logic within the `_match_one` function needs to be carefully reviewed and potentially modified to handle filter strings with spaces or special characters in a way that does not lead to parsing or comparison errors.

The corrected code for the `_match_one` function is provided below:

```python
def _match_one(filter_part, dct):
    # ... (other code)

    actual_value = dct.get(m.group('key'))
    comparison_value = m.group('intval') or m.group('strval')
    if comparison_value is None:
        raise ValueError('Invalid comparison value in filter part %r' % filter_part)
    if actual_value is None:
        return m.group('none_inclusive')
    return op(actual_value, comparison_value)
```

This modified code provides a simplified and more robust approach to performing the comparison, ensuring that appropriate values are extracted from the `dct` dictionary and compared with the filter criteria provided in the filter string.
