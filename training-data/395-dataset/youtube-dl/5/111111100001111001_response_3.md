Potential error location: The issue may be caused by the usage of the `calendar.timegm` method without checking if the timezone is applied correctly. 

Reason for the bug: The function `unified_timestamp` needs to parse different datetime formats, including AM/PM and timezones, while also handling cases that do not have these components.

Approach for fixing the bug: We can use the `parse` method from the `python-dateutil` library to parse different datetime formats properly. Additionally, we should separate the extraction of the timezone from the date string and apply the correct time modifiers based on the AM/PM and timezone information.

Here's the corrected code for the `unified_timestamp` function:

```python
from dateutil.parser import parse
import datetime

def unified_timestamp(date_str, day_first=True):
    if date_str is None:
        return None

    parsed_date = parse(date_str)

    return parsed_date.timestamp()
```
