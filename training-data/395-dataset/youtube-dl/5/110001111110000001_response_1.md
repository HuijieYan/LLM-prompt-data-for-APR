The error is occurring in the `unified_timestamp` function when the test case `unified_timestamp('May 16, 2016 11:15 PM')` is being executed. The error is due to an AttributeError, which indicates that a 'tuple' object has no attribute 'timetuple'.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `return calendar.timegm(timetuple.timetuple())`. The variable `timetuple` is a tuple object, and the code is trying to access the `timetuple` attribute of this tuple, which does not exist. This is causing the AttributeError.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `timetuple` variable is being used incorrectly. It is supposed to be a tuple containing the date and time information parsed from the input `date_str`, but it is being treated as an object with a `timetuple` attribute.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the code to correctly process the `timetuple` tuple and convert it into a timestamp.

Here's the corrected code for the `unified_timestamp` function:

```python
import datetime
import re
import calendar
import email.utils

# ... (other functions) ...

def unified_timestamp(date_str, day_first=True):
    if date_str is None:
        return None

    date_str = date_str.replace(',', ' ')

    pm_delta = datetime.timedelta(hours=12 if re.search(r'(?i)PM', date_str) else 0)
    timezone, date_str = extract_timezone(date_str)

    # Remove AM/PM + timezone
    date_str = re.sub(r'(?i)\s*(?:AM|PM)(?:\s+[A-Z]+)?', '', date_str)

    for expression in date_formats(day_first):
        try:
            dt = datetime.datetime.strptime(date_str, expression) - timezone + pm_delta
            return calendar.timegm(dt.timetuple())
        except ValueError:
            pass

    # Convert the parsed date and time tuple to a timestamp
    timetuple = email.utils.parsedate_tz(date_str)
    if timetuple:
        timestamp = calendar.timegm(timetuple) - timezone.total_seconds() + pm_delta.total_seconds()
        return timestamp

    return None  # Return None if the date format is unknown
```

In the corrected code, the `timetuple` object returned by `email.utils.parsedate_tz` is directly used to calculate the timestamp. The timezone offset and PM delta are added to the timestamp before returning the final result. This approach ensures that the tuple is correctly processed to obtain the timestamp.
