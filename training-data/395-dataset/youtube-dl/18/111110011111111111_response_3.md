Based on the test case and the error message, it seems that the `ie_key` is not being properly overridden in the `process_ie_result` function when the `_type` is 'url_transparent'. This is leading to the incorrect comparison in the test case and the resulting assertion error.

The reason behind this bug is that in the `process_ie_result` function, the `ie_key` is not being correctly handled when the `_type` is 'url_transparent'. Instead, the `ie_key` from `ie_result` should be used to create the `new_result` without any modifications. This is important because in the `Fort2IE` class, the `ie_key` is being explicitly set and it should not be overridden in the `process_ie_result` function.

To fix this bug, an approach would be to modify the logic in the `process_ie_result` function to correctly handle the `ie_key` when the `_type` is 'url_transparent'.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_ie_result` function:

```python
def process_ie_result(self, ie_result, download=True, extra_info={}):
    # existing code
    # ...
  
    if result_type == 'url_transparent':
        new_result = ie_result.copy()
        
        # Update url if necessary
        new_result['url'] = ie_result['url']
        
        return self.process_ie_result(
            new_result, download=download, extra_info=extra_info)
    
    # other conditions and return statements remain unchanged
    # ...
```

In this corrected code, the `ie_key` is not explicitly modified when the `_type` is 'url_transparent', and the `new_result` is created using the `ie_result` without any changes to the `ie_key`. This ensures that the `ie_key` is not overridden in the case when `_type` is 'url_transparent', which addresses the original issue.
