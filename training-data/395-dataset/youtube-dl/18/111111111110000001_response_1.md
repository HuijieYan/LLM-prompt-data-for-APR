The test case `test_do_not_override_ie_key_in_url_transparent` expects that the 'id' in the downloaded result will be 'testid', but it is actually 'foo1_id', which causes the assertion error.

The potential error location within the `process_ie_result` function is the section where the result_type is ('url', 'url_transparent') and the 'ie_key' is not being properly handled, which leads to the incorrect 'id' in the downloaded result.

The bug occurs because the 'ie_key' from the initial extraction is not being properly handled and passed down through the subsequent processing of the results.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the 'ie_key' when processing 'url_transparent' results so that it propagates through the subsequent processing.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_ie_result` function:
```python
def process_ie_result(self, ie_result, download=True, extra_info={}):
    # ... (previous code remains unchanged) ...

    if result_type in ('url', 'url_transparent'):
        # ... (previous code remains unchanged) ...
        if ie_result.get('ie_key') is not None:
            extra_info['ie_key'] = ie_result['ie_key']  # propagate ie_key

    # ... (remaining code also remains unchanged) ...
```
In the fix, we add a check to extract and propagate the 'ie_key' from the 'url_transparent' result to the 'extra_info' before subsequent processing.

This fix ensures that the 'ie_key' is properly handled and propagated through the processing of 'url_transparent' results, ultimately leading to the correct 'id' in the downloaded result.
