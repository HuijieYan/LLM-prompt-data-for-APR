The error occurs when the test function tries to assert the value of `downloaded['id']` with the value `'testid'`, but it fails because the actual value is `'foo1_id'`. This suggests that the `process_ie_result` function is not properly modifying the `ie_result` as expected.

The potential error location is within the `process_ie_result` function, specifically within the logic related to the 'url_transparent' result type. When the result type is 'url_transparent', the function needs to ensure that the ie_key is properly overridden and propagated to the inner results.

The bug occurs because the `ie_key` from the outer result is not properly propagated to the inner result when the result type is 'url_transparent'.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `ie_key` from the outer result is correctly inherited and propagated to the inner result.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def process_ie_result(self, ie_result, download=True, extra_info={}):
    # existing code...

    if result_type == 'url_transparent':
        # Use the information from the embedding page
        info = self.extract_info(
            ie_result['url'], ie_key=ie_result.get('ie_key'),
            extra_info=extra_info, download=False, process=False)

        # existing code...

        new_result = info.copy()
        new_result.update(force_properties)

        # Set the _type of info to 'url_transparent'
        if new_result.get('_type') == 'url':
            new_result['_type'] = 'url_transparent'

        # Propagate the ie_key from the outer result
        if 'ie_key' in ie_result:
            new_result['ie_key'] = ie_result['ie_key']

        return self.process_ie_result(
            new_result, download=download, extra_info=extra_info)

    # existing code...
```

In the corrected code, we capture the `ie_key` from the outer result and propagate it to the inner result when the result type is 'url_transparent'. This ensures that the `ie_key` is properly inherited throughout the processing of transparent URLs.

By implementing this change, the bug related to the incorrect overriding of `ie_key` should be resolved.
