The error occurs in the test when it tries to assert the value of `downloaded['id']` against the expected value 'testid'. The actual value obtained is 'foo1_id', leading to an assertion error.

The issue in the `process_ie_result` function seems to be related to how the `ie_result` dictionary is handled, especially for the case where `result_type` is 'url_transparent'. It appears that the `ie_key` is not being handled correctly in this case, resulting in the incorrect value for the 'id' key.

The `process_ie_result` function should ensure that the `ie_key` is properly propagated or handled when the `result_type` is 'url_transparent', to ensure that the correct 'id' value is maintained.

One approach to fix this issue is to modify the code in the `process_ie_result` function to handle the `ie_key` and apply it appropriately when the `result_type` is 'url_transparent'. This may involve updating the `ie_result` dictionary with the correct `ie_key` and other relevant keys to ensure consistency.

Here is the corrected code for the `process_ie_result` function:

```python
def process_ie_result(self, ie_result, download=True, extra_info={}):
    # ... existing code ...

    if result_type == 'url_transparent':
        # Use the information from the embedding page
        info = self.extract_info(
            ie_result['url'], ie_key=ie_result.get('ie_key'),
            extra_info=extra_info, download=False, process=False)

        # Remaining code for check and handling of info

        # Update ie_result with correct ie_key
        ie_result['ie_key'] = info.get('ie_key', ie_result.get('ie_key'))

        # Merge force_properties and info
        # Remaining code for merging force_properties and info

    # ... remaining code for other result types ...

    return ie_result
```

In this corrected code, we ensure that the `ie_key` is handled properly when the `result_type` is 'url_transparent', and the `ie_result` dictionary is updated accordingly.

With this correction, the `process_ie_result` function should propagate the `ie_key` correctly and maintain the integrity of the 'id' value, resolving the assertion error in the test.
