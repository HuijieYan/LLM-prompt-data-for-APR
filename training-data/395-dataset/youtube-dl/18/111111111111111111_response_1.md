The test case `test_do_not_override_ie_key_in_url_transparent` creates a YoutubeDL object `ydl` and then adds three InfoExtractors `Foo1IE`, `Foo2IE`, and `Foo3IE` to it. The `extract_info` method is called on the YoutubeDL object with the URL "foo1:". The expected outcome is that the URL in the downloaded info dictionaries should be "foo3:" and the title should be "foo1 title".

The error message indicates that the extracted ID does not match the expected value. This suggests that there is a bug in the code that processes the info dictionaries in the `process_ie_result` method.

Upon analysis of the `process_ie_result` method, it is clear that the bug occurs when transitioning from a url_transparent result to a video result. The 'id' is not being properly set when transitioning from one extractor to another. This results in the incorrect extraction of the video ID.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the 'id' field is properly handled when transitioning from one extractor to another. This can be achieved by updating the 'id' field based on the new extractor's information.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_ie_result` method:

```python
# function signature
def process_ie_result(self, ie_result, download=True, extra_info={}):
    # existing code ...

    if result_type == 'video':
        self.add_extra_info(ie_result, extra_info)
        return self.process_video_result(ie_result, download=download)
    elif result_type == 'url':
        # We have to add extra_info to the results because it may be
        # contained in a playlist
        return self.extract_info(ie_result['url'],
                                download,
                                ie_key=ie_result.get('ie_key'),
                                extra_info=extra_info)
    elif result_type == 'url_transparent':
        # Use the information from the embedding page
        info = self.extract_info(
            ie_result['url'], ie_key=ie_result.get('ie_key'),
            extra_info=extra_info, download=False, process=False)

        # Check for None and return early
        if not info:
            return info

        # update the id based on the new extractor's information
        new_result = info.copy()
        new_result['id'] = ie_result.get('id')
        new_result.update(force_properties)

        # Ensure that _type of info is overridden with url_transparent if needed
        if new_result.get('_type') == 'url':
            new_result['_type'] = 'url_transparent'

        return self.process_ie_result(
            new_result, download=download, extra_info=extra_info)
    # remaining code ...
```

In the corrected code, when transitioning from a url_transparent result to a video result, the 'id' field is properly updated based on the new extractor's information. This ensures that the extracted video ID matches the expected value.
