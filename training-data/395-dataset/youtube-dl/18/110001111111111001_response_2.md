Based on the provided information, it seems that the issue lies in the incorrect processing of the `ie_result` and the override of the `ie_key` attribute. This results in the incorrect 'id' field in the downloaded info dictionaries.

The buggy function `process_ie_result` incorrectly handles the `url_transparent` result type. It is overriding the 'ie_key' attribute in the returned info dictionary, which leads to incorrect behavior in the downloader.

To fix this issue, the code for the 'url_transparent' result type should be modified to preserve the 'ie_key' attribute and avoid its override. This will ensure that the 'id' field is correctly derived from the original 'ie_key' value.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def process_ie_result(self, ie_result, download=True, extra_info={}):
    result_type = ie_result.get('_type', 'video')

    if result_type in ('url', 'url_transparent'):
        # existing code ...

        if result_type == 'url_transparent':
            new_result = ie_result.copy()
            if 'ie_key' in new_result:
                new_result['_type'] = 'url_transparent'
                return self.process_ie_result(
                    new_result, download=download, extra_info=extra_info)
            else:
                new_result['_type'] = 'url'  # Assuming default type if ie_key is not present
                return self.extract_info(
                    new_result['url'], download,
                    ie_key=new_result.get('ie_key'),
                    extra_info=extra_info)

    # existing code ...
```

This corrected code ensures that the 'ie_key' attribute is not overridden when dealing with 'url_transparent' type. If 'ie_key' is present in the original result, it continues to preserve it and processes the result accordingly.

By implementing this change, the incorrect override of 'ie_key' is avoided, and the 'id' field in the downloaded info dictionaries should be correct.

The corrected implementation takes into account preserving the 'ie_key' attribute, which was initially being overridden incorrectly. This modification should address the issue observed in the test case.
