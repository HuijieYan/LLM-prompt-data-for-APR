The test case `test_do_not_override_ie_key_in_url_transparent` creates a situation where the `ie_result` returned by `Foo1IE` contains an `ie_key` field, and the subsequent `ie_result` returned by `Foo2IE` should not override the `ie_key` field but should include it as is in the final result. However, the current implementation of the `process_ie_result` function is overriding the `ie_key` field in certain scenarios.

The potential error location within the `process_ie_result` function is the block of code that handles the `url_transparent` result type. Specifically, the creation of `force_properties` and the subsequent merging with `info` to form `new_result` might be overwriting the `ie_key` field.

The occurrence of the bug might be due to the handling of the `ie_key` field during the merging of properties. The `ie_key` should be preserved as is and should not be modified before the final result is returned.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `ie_key` field is not modified or overridden during the merging process. One possible approach would be to check for the presence of the `ie_key` field in `force_properties` and skip it during the merging process.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_ie_result` function:

```python
def process_ie_result(self, ie_result, download=True, extra_info={}):
    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

    if result_type == 'url_transparent':
        # Use the information from the embedding page
        info = self.extract_info(
            ie_result['url'], ie_key=ie_result.get('ie_key'),
            extra_info=extra_info, download=False, process=False)

        # extract_info may return None when ignoreerrors is enabled and
        # extraction failed with an error, don't crash and return early
        # in this case
        if not info:
            return info

        force_properties = dict(
            (k, v) for k, v in ie_result.items() if k not in ('_type', 'url', 'ie_key'))

        new_result = info.copy()
        new_result.update(force_properties)

        # Extracted info may not be a video result (i.e.
        # info.get('_type', 'video') != video) but rather an url or
        # url_transparent. In such cases outer metadata (from ie_result)
        # should be propagated to inner one (info). For this to happen
        # _type of info should be overridden with url_transparent. This
        # fixes issue from https://github.com/rg3/youtube-dl/pull/11163.
        if new_result.get('_type') == 'url':
            new_result['_type'] = 'url_transparent'
        
        return self.process_ie_result(
            new_result, download=download, extra_info=extra_info)

    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)
```

In the corrected code, we exclude the 'ie_key' field from the `force_properties` dictionary to ensure that it's not modified or overridden during the merging process. This change should prevent the issue of the `ie_key` field being overwritten in the final result.
