The potential error location within the "build_format_selector" function is the missing import statement for the "collections" module. The code references "collections.namedtuple" and "itertools.product," so it seems that these are being used without being imported.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is the missing import statements for the "collections" and "itertools" modules, which are required for the correct functioning of the code.

To fix the bug, we need to add the following import statements at the beginning of the file:
```python
import collections
import itertools
```

Here's the corrected code for the "build_format_selector" function with the necessary import statements added:

```python
# Add import statements
import io
import itertools
import collections
import tokenize
from youtube_dl.compat import compat_tokenize_tokenize

# ... (other code remains unchanged) ...

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    def syntax_error(note, start):
        message = (
            'Invalid format specification: '
            '{0}\n\t{1}\n\t{2}^'.format(note, format_spec, ' ' * start[1]))
        return SyntaxError(message)

    PICKFIRST = 'PICKFIRST'
    MERGE = 'MERGE'
    SINGLE = 'SINGLE'
    GROUP = 'GROUP'
    FormatSelector = collections.namedtuple('FormatSelector', ['type', 'selector', 'filters'])

    # ... (other code remains unchanged) ...
```

With the addition of the necessary import statements, the "build_format_selector" function should work correctly.
