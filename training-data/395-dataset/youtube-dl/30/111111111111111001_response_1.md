The error message indicates an `IndexError` caused by a list index being out of range. This is likely due to an attempt to access an index in a list that does not exist.

Upon analyzing the code, the `selector_function` within the `build_format_selector` method processes the formats and tries to yield a format based on a specific index, causing the `IndexError`. This is because the format list `formats` is empty when it reaches the `yield formats[format_idx]` line.

The bug occurs because the improper handling of format selection logic when dealing with an empty format list.

To fix the bug, a check should be added to verify if the `formats` list is empty before trying to yield a format based on an index. This can be achieved by adding a condition to handle the case when the format list is empty.

Here's the corrected version of the `build_format_selector` method:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # ... (previous code)

    def selector_function(formats):
        if not formats:
            return  # Handle the case when formats list is empty
        if format_spec == 'all':
            for f in formats:
                yield f
        elif format_spec in ['best', 'worst', None]:
            # (previous logic)
            yield formats[format_idx]

    # ... (remaining code)
```

By adding the condition `if not formats: return`, we ensure that the function will not try to yield a format if the `formats` list is empty. This modification will prevent the `IndexError` and handle the case when there are no formats to select from.
