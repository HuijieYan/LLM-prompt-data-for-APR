The test case `test_format_filtering` involves testing various format filtering options based on the provided formats. The formats are filtered based on conditions and the expected behavior is determined for each test case.

The error occurs in the `selector_function` method within the `build_format_selector` function of the class `YoutubeDL`. The error is an `IndexError` with the message "list index out of range".

The reason for this error is that in the `selector_function` method, there is a conditional block that checks if the `format_spec` is `'best'`, `'worst'`, or `None`. If the conditions are not met, it tries to yield a format based on the `format_idx`, which can cause an `IndexError` if there are no formats available.

To fix this bug, the conditional block should be modified to handle the case when there are no audiovideo formats or when the format_spec is not one of the specified options.

Here's the corrected code for the `build_format_selector` method:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # ... previous implementation ...

    def selector_function(formats):
        if format_spec == 'all':
            for f in formats:
                yield f
        elif format_spec in ['best', 'worst', None]:
            video_formats = [f for f in formats if f.get('vcodec') != 'none']
            audio_formats = [f for f in formats if f.get('acodec') != 'none']
            if format_spec == 'best':
                if audio_formats:
                    yield max(audio_formats, key=lambda x: x['filesize'])
                elif video_formats:
                    yield max(video_formats, key=lambda x: x['filesize'])
                else:
                    yield None
            elif format_spec == 'worst':
                if audio_formats:
                    yield min(audio_formats, key=lambda x: x['filesize'])
                elif video_formats:
                    yield min(video_formats, key=lambda x: x['filesize'])
                else:
                    yield None
        else:
            # Handle other format_spec cases
            yield None

    # ... rest of the implementation ...
```

In this corrected implementation, additional handling is provided for cases when there are no audiovideo formats or when the `format_spec` is not one of the specified options. This will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.
