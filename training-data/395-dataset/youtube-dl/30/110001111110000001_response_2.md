The error message suggests that an index error occurred in the `selector_function` of the `build_format_selector` method within the YouTubeDL class. It seems that there is an issue with accessing an index of an empty list, which causes the index out of range error.

Upon analyzing the code, it appears that the `formats` list is not being passed into the `selector_function` correctly from the test cases. This is causing the `formats` list to be empty when the `selector_function` is called, leading to the index out of range error.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `formats` list is properly passed into the `selector_function` when it is called.

Here's the corrected code for the `build_format_selector` method:

```python
# Corrected version of the build_format_selector function
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # ... (other code remains the same) ...

    def selector_function(formats):
        if format_spec == 'all' and formats:
            for f in formats:
                yield f
        elif format_spec in ['best', 'worst', None] and formats:
            format_idx = 0 if format_spec == 'worst' else -1
            audiovideo_formats = [
                f for f in formats
                if f.get('vcodec') != 'none' and f.get('acodec') != 'none']
            if audiovideo_formats:
                yield audiovideo_formats[format_idx]
            # for audio only (soundcloud) or video only (imgur) urls, select the best/worst audio format
            elif (all(f.get('acodec') != 'none' for f in formats) or
                  all(f.get('vcodec') != 'none' for f in formats)):
                yield formats[format_idx]

    # ... (remaining code remains the same) ...
```

In the corrected code, the `selector_function` checks if the `formats` list is not empty before attempting to access its elements. This ensures that the index out of range error is avoided.

By making this change, we can address the index out of range error and ensure that the `formats` list is properly handled within the `selector_function`.
