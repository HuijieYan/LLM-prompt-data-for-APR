The error occurred due to an `IndexError` in the `selector_function` of the `build_format_selector` method. This error is raised because the `formats` list is empty at the point where the yield statement is trying to access it using an index.

The bug is likely related to how the `formats` list is being handled and processed within the `selector_function`. It seems that there is an issue with how formats are being filtered and selected based on the provided format specifications.

To fix the bug, the `selector_function` should be modified to handle the case when the `formats` list is empty. Additionally, the logic for selecting formats based on the format specifications should be carefully reviewed and adjusted as needed.

Here's the corrected code for the `build_format_selector` method:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # ... existing code ...

    def final_selector(formats):
        # Ensure that the 'formats' list is not empty before processing
        if not formats:
            return []

        # Rest of the existing code for final_selector function

    return final_selector
```

In the 'final_selector' function, before processing the 'formats' list, I added a check to ensure that the list is not empty. If the 'formats' list is empty, an empty list is returned to avoid the IndexError. Otherwise, the existing code for processing and filtering the 'formats' list remains the same.
