The error occurs in the `selector_function` within the `build_format_selector` method of the `YoutubeDL` class. The error is due to an empty `formats` list being provided to the function, resulting in an `IndexError` when trying to access an element from an empty list.

To fix the bug, the `selector_function` should be modified to handle the case where the `formats` list is empty. This can be achieved by adding a condition to check if the `formats` list is empty, and if so, returning an empty list or handling it in an appropriate way based on the specific requirements of the application.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic `build_format_selector` method:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    def selector_function(formats):
        if not formats:
            return []  # Return an empty list if formats is empty

        # Existing logic for format selection
        # ...

    # ... (other code remains unchanged)
```

By adding the conditional check to handle the empty `formats` list, the `IndexError` will be avoided, and the function will handle the case more gracefully.

This fix will ensure that the `selector_function` can handle scenarios where the `formats` list is empty and prevent the occurrence of the `IndexError`.
