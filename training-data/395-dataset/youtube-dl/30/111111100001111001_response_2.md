The error appears to be originating from the `_parse_format_selection` function, which is unable to properly parse the format specification provided.

Upon analyzing the bug, it seems that the cause of the issue might be due to missing imports. The usage of collections and itertools within the `build_format_selector` function requires appropriate imports.

To fix the bug, we should import these modules at the beginning of the file:

```python
import collections
import itertools
```

These imports are necessary to ensure that the functions used in the `build_format_selector` method work correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import collections
import itertools

# ... (other code remains unchanged)

def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    def syntax_error(note, start):
        message = (
            'Invalid format specification: '
            '{0}\n\t{1}\n\t{2}^'.format(note, format_spec, ' ' * start[1]))
        return SyntaxError(message)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```
