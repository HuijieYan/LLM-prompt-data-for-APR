The error message indicates an "IndexError" occurring on line 1021 of the "YouTubeDL.py" file. This suggests that there is an issue with the format selection logic inside the "selector_function" of the "build_format_selector" method.

The potential error location can be found within the "selector_function" where "format_idx" is used to access the "formats" list based on the "format_idx" value.

The bug occurs because the "selector_function" is trying to yield a format from the "formats" list based on the value of "format_idx", but it seems that the "formats" list is empty in this context.

To fix this bug, it would be necessary to ensure that the "formats" list contains valid entries before attempting to access it based on the "format_idx" value.

Here's the corrected code for the "build_format_selector" method:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # ... (previous code remains unchanged) ...

    def selector_function(formats):
        if not formats:
            return  # Handle empty formats list gracefully
        if format_spec == 'all':
            for f in formats:
                yield f
        elif format_spec in ['best', 'worst', None]:
            format_idx = 0 if format_spec == 'worst' else -1
            audiovideo_formats = [
                f for f in formats
                if f.get('vcodec') != 'none' and f.get('acodec') != 'none']
            if audiovideo_formats:
                yield audiovideo_formats[format_idx]
            # for audio only (soundcloud) or video only (imgur) urls, select the best/worst audio format
            elif (all(f.get('acodec') != 'none' for f in formats) or
                  all(f.get('vcodec') != 'none' for f in formats)):
                if 0 <= format_idx < len(formats):  # Added a check to ensure valid access to formats list
                    yield formats[format_idx]
        # ... (remaining code remains unchanged) ...

    # ... (remaining code remains unchanged) ...
```

In the corrected code, I added a check to ensure that the "formats" list is not empty before attempting to yield a format based on the "format_idx" value. This should prevent the "IndexError" from occurring due to an empty "formats" list.
