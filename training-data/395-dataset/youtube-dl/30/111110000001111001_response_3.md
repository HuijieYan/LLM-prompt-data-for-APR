The buggy function seems to be trying to parse and process a format selector for YoutubeDL objects. The error occurs due to some missing imports and undefined variables within the function.

Here are the issues and their suggested fixes:

1. The `collections` module is used to create a named tuple `FormatSelector`, but it is not imported at the beginning of the code. To fix this, the following import statement should be added to the beginning of the file:
   ```python
   import collections
   ```

2. The `tokenize` module is used to perform tokenization within the function, but it is not imported at the beginning of the code. To fix this, the following import statement should be added to the beginning of the file:
   ```python
   import tokenize
   ```

3. The function seems to handle parsing and processing of format specifications, but it's not clear what `tokens` represents and where it comes from. It's possible that the function expects a `TokenIterator` object but it's not being provided correctly.

After addressing the above issues, the corrected code for the `build_format_selector` function is as follows:

```python
import collections
import tokenize

class YoutubeDL(object):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
        def syntax_error(note, start):
            message = (
                'Invalid format specification: '
                '{0}\n\t{1}\n\t{2}^'.format(note, format_spec, ' ' * start[1]))
            return SyntaxError(message)
    
        PICKFIRST = 'PICKFIRST'
        MERGE = 'MERGE'
        SINGLE = 'SINGLE'
        GROUP = 'GROUP'

        FormatSelector = collections.namedtuple('FormatSelector', ['type', 'selector', 'filters'])

        # other functions and logic remain unchanged

        stream = io.BytesIO(format_spec.encode('utf-8'))
        try:
            tokens = list(tokenize.tokenize(stream.readline))
        except tokenize.TokenError:
            raise syntax_error('Missing closing/opening brackets or parenthesis', (0, len(format_spec)))

        # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By addressing the missing imports and ensuring the correct handling of the `tokens` variable, the function should behave as expected.
