The test case is attempting to process a list of formats using the `build_format_selector` function. The error message indicates that an IndexError occurred at line 1021 in the `YoutubeDL.py` file. This indicates that the issue lies within the `selector_function` in the `YoutubeDL.py` file, specifically at the point where it attempts to yield a format from an empty list.

The reason for the bug is that the `selector_function` is trying to access an element from an empty list of formats, causing the IndexError.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the `formats` list is not empty before attempting to access its elements. We also need to ensure that the `format_spec` variable is properly defined within the `selector_function`.

Here's the corrected code for the `build_format_selector` function:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    def syntax_error(note, start):
        message = (
            'Invalid format specification: '
            '{0}\n\t{1}\n\t{2}^'.format(note, format_spec, ' ' * start[1]))
        return SyntaxError(message)
    
    # Existing code

    def selector_function(formats):
        if not formats:
            return []

        if format_spec == 'all':
            for f in formats:
                yield f
        elif format_spec in ['best', 'worst', None]:
            format_idx = 0 if format_spec == 'worst' else -1
            audiovideo_formats = [
                f for f in formats
                if f.get('vcodec') != 'none' and f.get('acodec') != 'none']
            if audiovideo_formats:
                yield audiovideo_formats[format_idx]
            # for audio only (soundcloud) or video only (imgur) urls, select the best/worst audio format
            elif (all(f.get('acodec') != 'none' for f in formats) or
                  all(f.get('vcodec') != 'none' for f in formats)):
                yield formats[format_idx]
        # Existing code
    return selector_function
```

In this corrected code, we added a check to ensure that the `formats` list is not empty before attempting to yield any formats. This should prevent the IndexError from occurring.
