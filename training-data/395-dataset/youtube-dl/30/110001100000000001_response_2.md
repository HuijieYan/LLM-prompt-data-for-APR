The potential error in the problematic function is in the `syntax_error` function. The function is defined inside the `build_format_selector` method, which is not standard practice as it's better to define it outside the method. This results in an unnecessary redefinition of the `syntax_error` function each time `build_format_selector` is called.

To fix this issue, the `syntax_error` function should be defined outside the `build_format_selector` method. Also, the `collections` module needs to be imported to use `namedtuple` in the `FormatSelector` definition.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import collections

def syntax_error(note, format_spec, start):
    message = (
        'Invalid format specification: '
        '{0}\n\t{1}\n\t{2}^'.format(note, format_spec, ' ' * start[1]))
    return SyntaxError(message)

# this is the corrected function
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    PICKFIRST = 'PICKFIRST'
    MERGE = 'MERGE'
    SINGLE = 'SINGLE'
    GROUP = 'GROUP'
    FormatSelector = collections.namedtuple('FormatSelector', ['type', 'selector', 'filters'])
    
    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

By defining the `syntax_error` function outside the `build_format_selector` method and importing the `collections` module, we ensure that the `syntax_error` function is defined only once and can be reused whenever needed.
