The error message indicates an "IndexError" at line 1021 of the YoutubeDL.py file. This error occurs when trying to access an index that does not exist in a list.

Looking at the test function, it seems to be related to the "selector_function" within the "build_format_selector" method in the YoutubeDL.py file. The "selector_function" is yielding a format based on the "format_idx" index, which is leading to an IndexError.

The reason behind this bug is most likely related to the conditions and index calculations within the "selector_function" not aligning with the actual format data.

To fix this bug, the condition and index calculations within the "selector_function" should be reviewed and updated to ensure that they align with the format data and do not lead to IndexError.

The corrected code for the problematic function "build_format_selector" could be as follows:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # ... (other code remains the same)
    
    def selector_function(formats):
        if format_spec == 'all':
            for f in formats:
                yield f
        elif format_spec in ['best', 'worst', None]:
            if format_spec == 'worst':
                format_idx = 0
            else:
                format_idx = -1
            audiovideo_formats = [
                f for f in formats
                if f.get('vcodec') is not None and f.get('acodec') is not None]
            if audiovideo_formats:
                yield audiovideo_formats[format_idx]
            # for audio only (soundcloud) or video only (imgur) urls, select the best/worst audio format
            elif all(f.get('acodec') is not None for f in formats) or all(f.get('vcodec') is not None for f in formats):
                yield formats[format_idx]
        # (other conditions and index calculations)
    
    # ... (other code remains the same)
```

In the corrected code, the conditions and index calculations have been adjusted to ensure that they are correctly aligned with the format data and do not lead to IndexError.
