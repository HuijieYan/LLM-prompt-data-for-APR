The error message "IndexError: list index out of range" suggests that the bug is likely to be at the yield statement within the selector_function in the build_format_selector method. This error occurs when trying to access an index of a list that does not exist.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the format_idx variable is being used to access the index of the format, but it doesn't take into account the case when the formats array is empty. This results in the list index being out of range.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to check if the formats array is empty before attempting to access its elements by index.

Here's the corrected code for the build_format_selector method:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # other functions and variables remain the same as in the initial function
    
    def selector_function(formats):
        if not formats:
            return []  # If formats array is empty, return an empty list
        if format_spec == 'all':
            for f in formats:
                yield f
        elif format_spec in ['best', 'worst', None]:
            format_idx = 0 if format_spec == 'worst' else -1
            audiovideo_formats = [
                f for f in formats
                if f.get('vcodec') != 'none' and f.get('acodec') != 'none']
            if audiovideo_formats:
                yield audiovideo_formats[format_idx]
            # for audio only (soundcloud) or video only (imgur) urls, select the best/worst audio format
            elif (all(f.get('acodec') != 'none' for f in formats) or
                  all(f.get('vcodec') != 'none' for f in formats)):
                yield formats[format_idx]
    
    # the rest of the function remains the same
```

By adding a check for an empty formats array at the beginning of the selector_function, we prevent the IndexError from occurring, and the function will return an empty list if there are no formats available.
