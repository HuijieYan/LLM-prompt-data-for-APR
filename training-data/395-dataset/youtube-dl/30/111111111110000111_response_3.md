The error message indicates an "IndexError" in the "selector_function" of the "build_format_selector" method in the YoutubeDL class. The error occurs at the line "yield formats[format_idx]" where it tries to access a format from an empty list, resulting in the IndexError.

The reason behind the occurrence of this bug is that the format list is empty when the "selector_function" is called, leading to an attempt to access an index that does not exist.

To fix this bug, the format list should be checked for emptiness before attempting to access an index. Additionally, the logic for selecting the format based on the "format_spec" should be reviewed to ensure that the correct format is selected based on the specifications provided.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic "build_format_selector" method:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
        # ... (existing code) ...

        def selector_function(formats):
            if not formats:
                return []

            if format_spec == 'all':
                return formats
            elif format_spec in ['best', 'worst', None]:
                format_idx = 0 if format_spec == 'worst' else -1
                audiovideo_formats = [
                    f for f in formats
                    if f.get('vcodec') != 'none' and f.get('acodec') != 'none']
                if audiovideo_formats:
                    return [audiovideo_formats[format_idx]]
                # for audio only (soundcloud) or video only (imgur) urls, select the best/worst audio format
                elif all(f.get('acodec') != 'none' for f in formats) or all(f.get('vcodec') != 'none' for f in formats):
                    return [formats[format_idx]]

            # ... (rest of the code) ...

```
With these changes, the "selector_function" now checks for an empty formats list and returns an empty list if no formats are available. This prevents the IndexError from occurring and ensures that the selector logic works correctly with the provided format specifications.
