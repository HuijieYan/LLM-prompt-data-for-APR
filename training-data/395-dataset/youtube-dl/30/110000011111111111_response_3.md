The error message indicates that there is an IndexError occurring at line 1021 of the YoutubeDL.py file. This error is caused by a list index out of range, which most likely occurs due to incorrect format selection logic that leads to an empty `formats` list or an improper format index calculation.

The suspected potential error location within the problematic function is in the `selector_function` where the `yield formats[format_idx]` line is causing the IndexError.

The bug occurs due to the improper handling of format selection and the calculation of the format index. This leads to an empty `formats` list or an improper calculation of the index value, resulting in the IndexError.

To fix this bug, review the format selection logic and ensure that it properly handles the formats list, as well as the calculation of the format index. Make sure to handle cases where formats might be empty or where the index calculations might result in an out-of-range index.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    import collections
    import io
    import itertools
    import tokenize

    # Rest of the function remains the same as the provided code, but with potential changes based on the analysis
    # ...

    def selector_function(formats):
        if not formats:
            return

        max_idx = len(formats) - 1
        format_idx = 0 if format_spec == 'worst' else max_idx
        if 0 <= format_idx <= max_idx:
            yield formats[format_idx]
        else:
            # Handle edge cases or empty formats list appropriately
            return

    # ...
```

This corrected code includes handling the empty `formats` list and ensuring that the format index calculation stays within the valid range. Additionally, any edge cases related to format selection should be appropriately handled within the function based on the specific requirements and use cases.
