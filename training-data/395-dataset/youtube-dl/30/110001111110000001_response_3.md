This error arises from the `selector_function` within the `build_format_selector` method. The error occurs when attempting to yield a format from an empty list, leading to a `IndexError: list index out of range`.

The reason for this bug is that the variable `formats` is an empty list when it is passed to the `selector_function`. This is likely due to incorrect parsing or filtering of the formats, leading to an empty list being passed to the `selector_function`.

To fix this bug:
1. Check the parsing and filtering logic for formats to ensure that valid formats are being passed to the `selector_function`.
2. Add a check within the `selector_function` to handle the case when `formats` is empty, so that it does not attempt to yield a format from an empty list.

Here's the corrected code for the `build_format_selector` method:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # ... (other code) ...

    def final_selector(formats):
        filtered_formats = formats
        for _filter in filters:
            filtered_formats = list(filter(_filter, filtered_formats))
        if not filtered_formats:  # Check if no formats match the filter
            return []  # Return an empty list if there are no valid formats
        return selector_function(filtered_formats)

    return final_selector
```

In the corrected code, a check is added to `final_selector` to ensure that if the `filtered_formats` list is empty, it returns an empty list without attempting to yield a format. This check prevents the `IndexError` from occurring when there are no valid formats to yield.
