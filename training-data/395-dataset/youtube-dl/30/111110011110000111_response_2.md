The error is occurring in the `selector_function` within the `build_format_selector` method of the `YoutubeDL` class. The error is an `IndexError` stating that the list index is out of range, pointing to the line `yield formats[format_idx]`. This indicates that the `formats` list is empty, leading to the index being out of range.

The root cause of the bug is that the format selector function is not correctly handling the format_spec condition 'best', 'worst', or None when the 'formats' list is empty. This is causing the index error because it is trying to yield a format from the empty list.

To fix this bug, the following approach can be taken:
1. Check if the 'formats' list is empty, and handle it appropriately without trying to select a format.
2. Add proper error handling and validation to ensure that the format selection logic works even when the 'formats' list is empty.

Here's the corrected code for the `build_format_selector` method:

```python
def build_format_selector(self, format_spec):
    # Existing code

    def selector_function(formats):
        if not formats:
            return  # Do not yield any format if the 'formats' list is empty
        # Existing code for selector_function

    # Existing code

    stream = io.BytesIO(format_spec.encode('utf-8'))
    try:
        tokens = list(compat_tokenize_tokenize(stream.readline))
    except tokenize.TokenError:
        raise syntax_error('Missing closing/opening brackets or parenthesis', (0, len(format_spec)))
    
    # Existing code
```

By adding a check for empty 'formats' list in the `selector_function`, we can prevent the index error from occurring when trying to select the best or worst format. This ensures that the format selection logic works even when there are no formats available.

This should fix the bug and prevent the index error from occurring when running the test function.
