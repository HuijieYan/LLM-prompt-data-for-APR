The issue with the `js_to_json` function is that the `fix_kv` function is nested inside it, which makes it difficult to access directly. This nested structure can cause potential issues in terms of readability and maintainability as well.

To resolve this issue, we can move the `fix_kv` function outside of the `js_to_json` function. This way, it can be accessed directly, and the nested structure does not cause any issues.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/youtube-dl_26/youtube_dl/utils.py

import re

# relative function's signature in this file
def fix_kv(m):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass


# corrected js_to_json function
def js_to_json(code):
    return re.sub(r'''(?sx)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nurtbfx/\n]))*[^"\\]*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nurtbfx/\n]))*[^'\\]*'|
        /\*.*?\*/|,(?=\s*[\]}])|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*|
        (?:0[xX][0-9a-fA-F]+|0+[0-7]+)(?:\s*:)?|
        [0-9]+(?=\s*:)
        ''', fix_kv, code)
```

By separating the `fix_kv` function from the `js_to_json` function, we have improved the readability and maintainability of the code. Additionally, it also ensures that the `fix_kv` function can be accessed directly.
