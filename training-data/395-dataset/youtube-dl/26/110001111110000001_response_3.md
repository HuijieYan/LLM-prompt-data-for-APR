The test case is failing because the `js_to_json` function is not working correctly. The reason for the bug is likely related to the regular expressions used to match and process JSON-like code. There could be issues with pattern matching and replacements leading to incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `js_to_json` function. We can start by simplifying the regular expressions and ensuring that the replacement logic is correct. It's crucial to pay attention to edge cases and special characters such as escape sequences.

Here is the corrected `js_to_json` function:

```python
import re

def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
            return v
        elif v.startswith('/*') or v == ',':
            return ""

        v = v.strip()

        if v[0] in ("'", '"'):
            v = re.sub(r'(?s)\\.|"', lambda m: {
                '"': '\\"',
                "\\'": "'",
                '\\\n': '',
                '\\x': '\\u00',
            }.get(m.group(0), m.group(0)), v[1:-1])

        return '"%s"' % v

    return re.sub(r'''(?sx)
        ["'].*?[^\\]["']|/\*.*?\*/|\s*,\s*|[a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*|\S+''', fix_kv, code)
```

This corrected code simplifies the regular expression and adjusts the replacement logic to ensure proper handling of JSON-like code. After applying this fix, rerun the test cases to ensure that the corrected function works as expected.
