Potential error location: 
The potential error location within the problematic function is the line that uses the re.sub function to remove any commas, periods, or plus signs from the input string. The code is missing the import statement for the re module, which means the re.sub function cannot be used.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The re.sub function is used to replace occurrences of a pattern in a string with another string. In this case, the intention is to remove certain characters from the input string. However, since the re module has not been imported, the code will raise a NameError when it tries to access the re module.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the re module needs to be imported at the beginning of the file. Additionally, it might be a good idea to use a try-except block to catch any potential errors with the input string to handle cases where the input is not a valid number.

Corrected code:
```python
import re  # import the re module

def str_to_int(int_str):
    """ A more relaxed version of int_or_none """
    if int_str is None:
        return None
    try:
        int_str = re.sub(r'[,\.\+]', '', int_str)  # remove commas, periods, and plus signs
        return int(int_str)
    except ValueError:
        return None  # return None if the input string is not a valid number
```
