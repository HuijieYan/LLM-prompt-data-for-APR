The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of the `re` module without importing it. This leads to a NameError.

The `re` module is used to perform regular expression operations. In the provided code, it is used to remove specific characters (',', '.', '+') from the input string `int_str`. However, since the `re` module is not imported, the code results in a NameError.

To fix the bug, the `re` module needs to be imported at the beginning of the script before it is used.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def str_to_int(int_str):
    """ A more relaxed version of int_or_none """
    if int_str is None:
        return None
    int_str = re.sub(r'[,\.\+]', '', int_str)
    return int(int_str)
```
