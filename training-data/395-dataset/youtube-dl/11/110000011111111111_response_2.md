The error in the function `str_to_int` is due to the fact that the function `re.sub` expects a string or bytes-like object as input, but it's receiving an integer in the third test case. This leads to a `TypeError` because it can't perform the substitution on an integer.

To fix this issue, the `str_to_int` function should first check if the input parameter is already an integer. If it is, then it should be returned as is, without any modifications. If the input parameter is a string, then the function should remove the commas and periods from the string before converting it to an integer.

Here's the corrected `str_to_int` function:

```python
import re

def str_to_int(int_str):
    """ A more relaxed version of int_or_none """
    if isinstance(int_str, int):
        return int_str
    int_str = re.sub(r'[,\.\+]', '', int_str)
    return int(int_str)
```

With this correction, the function will first check if the input is already an integer, and if so, it will return it directly. If the input is a string, it will remove the commas and periods before converting it to an integer. This should resolve the `TypeError` that was occurring in the third test case.
