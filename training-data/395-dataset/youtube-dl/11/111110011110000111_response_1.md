1. The test case is trying to convert a string containing commas and dots into an integer. It also tests if the function can handle an integer input.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `int_str = re.sub(r'[,\.\+]', '', int_str)`. This line attempts to remove commas, dots, and plus signs from the `int_str` variable using regular expressions.

3. The error occurs because the `re.sub` function expects the `int_str` to be a string, but when the function is called with an integer input, it leads to a type error. The `re.sub` function cannot process an integer as an input.

4. One approach to fixing the bug is to first check if the input is a string before applying the regular expression. If the input is not a string, the function can simply return the input as it is. This will handle the case when an integer is passed to the function.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def str_to_int(int_str):
    """ A more relaxed version of int_or_none """
    if int_str is None:
        return None
    if not isinstance(int_str, str):
        return int_str
    int_str = re.sub(r'[,\.\+]', '', int_str)
    return int(int_str)
```

With this fix, the function first checks if the input is a string. If it's not a string, it returns the input as is. If it's a string, the regular expression is applied to remove commas, dots, and plus signs, and then the string is converted to an integer.
