Potential error location: The error in the code is likely occurring at the line `int_str = re.sub(r'[,\.\+]', '', int_str)` because the `re` module is used without being imported in the function.

Reason for the bug: The bug is occurring because the `re` module is not imported, and the `re.sub` function is being called without it.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: The `re` module needs to be imported at the beginning of the code in order to use the `re.sub` function.

Corrected code:

```python
import re

def str_to_int(int_str):
    """ A more relaxed version of int_or_none """
    if int_str is None:
        return None
    int_str = re.sub(r'[,\.\+]', '', int_str)
    return int(int_str)
```
