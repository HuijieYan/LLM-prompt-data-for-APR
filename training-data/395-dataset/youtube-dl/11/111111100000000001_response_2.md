Potential error location: The potential error in the function is with the use of the `re` module without importing it, as well as the incorrect regex pattern.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The `re` module is used without being imported in the function. This will result in a NameError.
2. The regex pattern used, r'[,\.\+]', is incorrect for removing commas, periods, and plus signs from the string. The correct pattern should be r'[,\.+]' to match any of those characters.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Import the `re` module at the beginning of the file.
2. Update the regex pattern to r'[,\.+]' to correctly match commas, periods, and plus signs.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import re

def str_to_int(int_str):
    """ A more relaxed version of int_or_none """
    if int_str is None:
        return None
    int_str = re.sub(r'[,\.+]', '', int_str)
    return int(int_str)
```
