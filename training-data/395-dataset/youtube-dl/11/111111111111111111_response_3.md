The bug in the `str_to_int` function is caused by the fact that the `re` (regular expression) module is being used without first importing it. This is evident from the error message, which indicates a `TypeError` due to the `re.sub` method expecting a string or bytes-like object, but receiving an integer instead.

To fix this bug, the `re` module needs to be imported at the beginning of the `utils.py` file. Once imported, the `re` module will be available for use in the `str_to_int` function, resolving the `TypeError` and allowing the function to correctly process the input.

Here is the corrected code for the `utils.py` file with the `re` module imported:

```python
import re

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def str_to_int(int_str):
    """ A more relaxed version of int_or_none """
    if int_str is None:
        return None
    int_str = re.sub(r'[,\.\+]', '', str(int_str))
    return int(int_str)
```

By importing the `re` module and using `str(int_str)` to ensure that `int_str` is treated as a string, the bug is fixed and the `str_to_int` function should now work as expected.
