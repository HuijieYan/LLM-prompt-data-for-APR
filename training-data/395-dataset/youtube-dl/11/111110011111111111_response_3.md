The error occurs when the function `str_to_int()` is called with an integer input. This is occurring because the function assumes that the input is a string and tries to apply the regular expression substitution on it, resulting in a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to check the type of the input. If the input is not a string, we can simply return it without any processing.

Here's the corrected code for the `str_to_int()` function:

```python
import re

def str_to_int(int_str):
    """ A more relaxed version of int_or_none """
    if int_str is None:
        return None
    if isinstance(int_str, str):
        int_str = re.sub(r'[,\.\+]', '', int_str)
    return int(int_str)
```

With this correction, the function first checks if the input is a string. If it is, then it performs the regular expression substitution. If it's not a string, it skips that step and proceeds to converting the input to an integer. This should fix the bug and allow the function to handle both string and integer inputs correctly.
