Potential error location: The use of re.sub without importing the re module suggests that the regular expression operation is not functioning as intended.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The re.sub function is used to replace every occurrence of the specified pattern (in this case, the characters ',', '.', and '+') with an empty string. However, the re module is not imported, so the code will raise a NameError when trying to access re. Additionally, the function does not handle the presence of non-numeric characters (other than ',' and '.') in the input string, which will result in a ValueError when attempting to convert the modified string to an integer.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Import the re module at the beginning of the file to use the re.sub function properly.
2. Use a more robust method to handle non-numeric characters, such as using regular expressions to match only digits in the input string.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/youtube-dl_11/youtube_dl/utils.py
import re

def str_to_int(int_str):
    """ A more relaxed version of int_or_none """
    if int_str is None:
        return None
    int_str = re.sub(r'[^0-9]', '', int_str)
    return int(int_str)
```
