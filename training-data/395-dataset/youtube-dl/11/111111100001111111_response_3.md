The buggy function `str_to_int` has the following issues:
1. It uses the `re` module without importing it, so the code will raise an error.
2. The function is supposed to remove commas, periods, and plus signs from the input string before converting it to an integer, but it only removes these characters without considering the sequence of characters.

To fix these issues, we need to import the `re` module and modify the regular expression used to remove the characters.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def str_to_int(int_str):
    """ A more relaxed version of int_or_none """
    if int_str is None:
        return None
    int_str = re.sub(r'[\.,\+]', '', int_str)
    return int(int_str)
```
