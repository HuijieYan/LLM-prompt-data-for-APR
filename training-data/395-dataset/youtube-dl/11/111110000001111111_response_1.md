Potential error location: The line int_str = re.sub(r'[,\.\+]', '', int_str) is removing the commas, periods, and plus signs from the input string, but the period is not being replaced with an empty string, which could cause issues when converting to an integer.

Reason for the bug: The re.sub() function is not replacing the period with an empty string, so when the input string has a period, it is not being removed, and the conversion to an integer will fail.

Approach to fixing the bug: Modify the regular expression in the re.sub() function to replace both commas and periods with an empty string.

Corrected code:
```python
import re

def str_to_int(int_str):
    """ A more relaxed version of int_or_none """
    if int_str is None:
        return None
    int_str = re.sub(r'[,\.\+]', '', int_str)
    return int(int_str)
```
