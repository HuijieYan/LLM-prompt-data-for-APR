The error in the `str_to_int` function is occurring because the `re` module has not been imported. The `re.sub` function is being called without the necessary import statement for the `re` module.

To fix this bug, we need to import the `re` module at the beginning of the file where the `str_to_int` function is defined. 

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import re

def str_to_int(int_str):
    """ A more relaxed version of int_or_none """
    if int_str is None:
        return None
    int_str = re.sub(r'[,\.\+]', '', int_str)
    return int(int_str)
```

By adding the `import re` statement at the beginning of the file, the `re` module will be available for use, and the `str_to_int` function will work as intended.
