Potential Error Location:
The potential error location within the problematic function is the line where the regular expression substitution is being performed. The intention seems to be to remove any commas, periods, or plus signs from the string before converting it to an integer.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The buggy function is missing the necessary import statement for the `re` module, which is used for regular expressions. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the input is already an integer without any commas, periods, or plus signs.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Import the `re` module at the beginning of the file using `import re`.
2. Use a conditional check to determine if the input is already an integer before attempting any regular expression substitution.

Corrected Code:
```python
import re

def str_to_int(int_str):
    """ A more relaxed version of int_or_none """
    if int_str is None:
        return None
    int_str = re.sub(r'[,\.\+]', '', int_str)
    if int_str.isdigit():
        return int(int_str)
    else:
        return None
```
