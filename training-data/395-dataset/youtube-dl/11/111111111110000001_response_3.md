Potential error location: The error is occurring in the line int_str = re.sub(r'[,\.\+]', '', int_str) within the str_to_int function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug is caused by the fact that the input to the str_to_int function is not always a string. The test case str_to_int(523) is passing an integer as input, which is causing the re.sub() function to throw a TypeError.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we should first check if the input int_str is a string before attempting to manipulate it using re.sub(). If it is not a string, we should return the input as is. If it is a string, then we can proceed with the manipulation.

Corrected code:

```python
import re

def str_to_int(int_str):
    """ A more relaxed version of int_or_none """
    if int_str is None:
        return None
    if isinstance(int_str, str):
        int_str = re.sub(r'[,\.\+]', '', int_str)
    return int(int_str)
```
