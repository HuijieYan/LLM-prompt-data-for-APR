Potential error location: The potential error location within the function is the use of the re module without importing it.

Reason behind the bug: The function uses the re module to perform a substitution on int_str, but the re module has not been imported.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The re module needs to be imported at the beginning of the file in order to use its functions within the str_to_int function.

Corrected code:
```python
import re

def str_to_int(int_str):
    """ A more relaxed version of int_or_none """
    if int_str is None:
        return None
    int_str = re.sub(r'[,\.\+]', '', int_str)
    return int(int_str)
```
