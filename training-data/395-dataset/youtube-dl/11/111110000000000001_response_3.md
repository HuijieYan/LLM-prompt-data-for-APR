Potential Error: The function is using the 're' module without importing it.

Reason for Bug: The 're' module is used for regular expressions, but it has not been imported in the function. This is causing the 're' module to be unrecognized and resulting in an error.

Approach for Fixing the Bug: Import the 're' module at the beginning of the script so that it can be used within the function.

Corrected code:

```python
import re

def str_to_int(int_str):
    """ A more relaxed version of int_or_none """
    if int_str is None:
        return None
    int_str = re.sub(r'[,\.\+]', '', int_str)
    return int(int_str)
```
