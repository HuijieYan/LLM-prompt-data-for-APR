The error message indicates that the `json.loads` call inside the `test_js_to_json_realworld` test case is failing due to "Extra data" present in the JSON string generated by the `js_to_json` function.

The potential error location within the `js_to_json` function is the regex pattern used in the first `re.sub` call, which is not correctly handling the single quote and newline characters.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the regex pattern is not accurately matching the input JSON string content, especially when it contains single quotes and newlines.

To fix the bug, the regex pattern and the corresponding substitution function (`fix_kv`) need to correctly handle single quotes and newlines inside the input JSON string.

Here's the corrected code for the `js_to_json` function:

```python
import re

def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
            return v
        if v.startswith('"'):
            return v
        if v.startswith("'"):
            v = v[1:-1]
            v = re.sub(r"\\\\|\\'|\\n", lambda m: {
                '\\\\': '\\\\',
                "\\'": "'",
                "\\n": "\n",
            }[m.group(0)], v)
        return f'"{v}"'

    res = re.sub(r'''(?x)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\")?)*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\')?|[\n])*'|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*
        ''', fix_kv, code)
    res = re.sub(r',(\s*\])', lambda m: m.group(1), res)
    return res
```

In the corrected code, the regex pattern and the `fix_kv` function have been updated to handle single quotes and newlines inside the input JSON string. Additionally, the use of f-strings has been incorporated for better string formatting.
