The buggy function `js_to_json` is designed to convert JavaScript to JSON. The issue seems to be with the `fix_kv` function which is responsible for handling string values within the JavaScript code.

The bug arises from the fact that the `fix_kv` function does not correctly handle all types of strings, especially when dealing with escape characters and converting single quotes to double quotes.

To fix the bug, the `fix_kv` function should be adjusted to correctly handle the conversion of single quote strings to double quote strings, as well as to properly handle escape characters.

The corrected code for the `js_to_json` function:

```python
import re
import json

def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
            return v
        if v.startswith('"'):
            return v
        if v.startswith("'"):
            v = v[1:-1]
            v = re.sub(r"\\\\|\\'|\"", lambda m: {'\\\\': '\\\\', "\\'": "'", '"': '\\"'}[m.group(0)], v)
            v = v.replace('\\n', '\n')  # Handle newline characters
            v = v.replace('\\u0027', "'")  # Handle unicode escape
        return '"%s"' % v

    res = re.sub(r'''(?x)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\")?)*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\')?)*'|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*
        ''', fix_kv, code)
    res = re.sub(r',(\s*\])', lambda m: m.group(1), res)
    return res
```

In the fixed `fix_kv` function:
- The handling of escape characters and converting single quotes to double quotes has been added.
- Newline characters and unicode escapes are now properly handled within the strings.

With this fix, the `js_to_json` function should now be able to correctly convert JavaScript to JSON and pass the provided test case without errors.
