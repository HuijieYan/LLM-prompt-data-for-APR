The bug in the provided code is within the `js_to_json` function. This function is using the `fix_kv` function to manipulate a string containing JavaScript code. The `fix_kv` function is correctly extracting and processing the substring `v` from the input `code`, but it doesn't handle the single-quoted strings properly.

The `js_to_json` function is supposed to convert a string of JavaScript code to JSON format. The current approach of using regular expressions for parsing JavaScript code and converting it to JSON is flawed. Instead, a more reliable approach would involve using a JavaScript parser to parse the input code and then convert the parsed JavaScript object to JSON.

Here's the corrected code for the `js_to_json` function using the `js2xml` library to parse the JavaScript code to an XML format and then using the `xmltodict` library to convert the XML to JSON:

```python
import js2xml
import xmltodict

def js_to_json(code):
    parsed_js = js2xml.parse(code)
    xml_data = str(parsed_js)
    json_data = xmltodict.parse(xml_data)
    return json_data
```

This corrected code provides a more reliable approach for converting JavaScript code to JSON format.
