Potential error location: The buggy function `js_to_json` is trying to replace characters in a string with their JSON equivalent.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The function `fix_kv` is defined inside the function `js_to_json`, which makes it difficult to reference the `fix_kv` function outside the `js_to_json`.
2. The `fix_kv` function doesn't seem to be fully implemented.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Move the `fix_kv` function outside the `js_to_json` function so that it can be accessed by other functions as well.
2. Implement the missing parts in the `fix_kv` function, such as handling special characters and escaping.

Corrected code:

```python
import re

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/youtube-dl_10/youtube_dl/utils.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def fix_kv(m):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# corrected js_to_json function
def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
            return v
        if v.startswith('"'):
            return v
        if v.startswith("'"):
            v = v[1:-1]
            v = re.sub(r"\\\\|\\'|\"", lambda m: {
                '\\\\': '\\\\',
                "\\'": "'",
                '"': '\\"',
            }[m.group(0)], v)
        return '"%s"' % v
    
    res = re.sub(r'''(?x)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\")?)*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\')?)*'|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*
        ''', fix_kv, code)
    res = re.sub(r',(\s*\])', lambda m: m.group(1), res)
    return res
