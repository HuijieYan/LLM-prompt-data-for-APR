The bug seems to be in the `fix_kv` function. It is not handling escape characters properly when code is in a single quoted string.

The reason behind the bug is that the `fix_kv` function is not handling escape characters properly when code is in a single quoted string. It is directly returning the characters without proper escape character conversion, which is causing the mismatch between expected and actual results.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to handle escape characters properly when the code is in a single quoted string. This can be achieved by modifying the `fix_kv` function to handle escape characters in both single and double quoted strings.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
            return v
        if v.startswith('"'):
            return v
        if v.startswith("'"):
            v = v[1:-1]
            v = re.sub(r'\\\\|\\\'|\\"', lambda m: {'\\\\': '\\\\', "\\'": "'", '\\"': '"'}[m.group(0)], v)
        return '"%s"' % v

    res = re.sub(r'''(?x)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\")?)*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\')?)*'|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*
        ''', fix_kv, code)
    res = re.sub(r',(\s*\])', lambda m: m.group(1), res)
    return res
```
