The potential error location is within the fix_kv function, particularly in the conditional statements. The bug occurs because the fix_kv function is not returning the expected value based on the input code.

To fix the bug, we can modify the fix_kv function to correctly handle the input code and return the expected value.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re

def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if "'" + v + "'" in code or '"' + v + '"' in code:
            return v
        else:
            return '"' + v + '"'
    
    res = re.sub(r'''(?x)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\")?)*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\')?)*'|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*
        ''', fix_kv, code)
    res = re.sub(r',(\s*\])', lambda m: m.group(1), res)
    return res
```

With this corrected code, the fix_kv function now correctly identifies whether the input value should be enclosed in double quotes or not, and returns the expected value based on the input code.
