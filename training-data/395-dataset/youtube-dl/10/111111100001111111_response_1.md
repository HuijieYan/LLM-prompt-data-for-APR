The issue with the current `js_to_json` function is that it does not correctly handle the processing of input code that it receives as a string. The aim of the function is to convert JavaScript code to a JSON string, but it fails to handle various cases and incorrectly processes the input.

The function `js_to_json` uses the `re.sub` function with `fix_kv` as the replacement function. This `fix_kv` function is responsible for modifying the matched strings based on certain conditions. However, the implementation of `fix_kv` is incorrect and does not handle all the cases properly.

To fix the bug, the `fix_kv` function needs to be adjusted to properly handle the cases for true, false, null, and strings. Additionally, the regular expressions used in the `re.sub` calls need to be modified to correctly process the input code.

Below is the corrected code for the `js_to_json` function:

```python
import re

def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
            return v
        if v.startswith('"') or v.startswith("'"):
            return v
        v = re.sub(r"\\\\|\\'|\"", lambda x: {
            '\\\\': '\\\\',
            "\\'": "'",
            '"': '\\"',
        }[x.group(0)], v)
        return '"%s"' % v

    res = re.sub(r'''(?x)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\")?)*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\')?)*'|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*
        ''', fix_kv, code)
    res = re.sub(r',(\s*\])', lambda m: m.group(1), res)
    return res
```

This corrected function addresses the issues with the original implementation and should now correctly convert JavaScript code to a JSON string.
