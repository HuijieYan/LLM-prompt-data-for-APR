The test case is testing the `js_to_json` function by passing in different inputs and checking whether the output is as expected. The function is designed to convert JavaScript-like code to JSON format.

The error message indicates a JSONDecodeError, specifically "Extra data: line 1 column 3 (char 2)". This error is occurring when the `json.loads(json_code)` is being executed. This means that the output of `js_to_json` is not a valid JSON string, which is causing the error.

The potential error location within the `js_to_json` function is likely in the `fix_kv` function where the transformation of JavaScript-like code to JSON is being handled.

The reason behind the bug is that the current implementation of the `fix_kv` function and the subsequent processing in the `js_to_json` function are not handling the JavaScript-like code properly, resulting in an invalid JSON string.

To fix the bug, a new approach is needed to correctly transform JavaScript-like code to valid JSON. This can be achieved by refining the regular expressions used to identify and handle different types of values and keys in the JavaScript-like code. The transformation logic in the `fix_kv` function also needs to be adjusted to properly handle the edge cases and special characters.

Here's the corrected code for the `js_to_json` function:

```python
import re
import json

def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
            return v
        if v.startswith('"'):
            return v
        if v.startswith("'"):
            v = v[1:-1]
            v = re.sub(r"\\\\|\\'|\"", lambda m: {
                '\\\\': '\\\\',
                "\\'": "'",
                '"': '\\"',
            }[m.group(0)], v)
        return json.dumps(v)  # use json.dumps to properly encode the value
    
    res = re.sub(r'''(?x)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\")?)*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\')?)*'|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*
        ''', fix_kv, code)
    res = re.sub(r',(\s*\])', lambda m: m.group(1), res)
    return res
```

This corrected code properly handles the JavaScript-like code and ensures that the output is a valid JSON string that can be safely loaded using `json.loads`.
