The `js_to_json` function is intended to convert a JavaScript-like object (with single quotes and no commas after the last item) into a JSON-like object (with double quotes and commas after the last item). However, the provided function has a few issues.

The error message indicates that the JSON decoding process failed because the input string had extra data, specifically at line 1, column 3 (char 2). This suggests that the function `js_to_json` is not producing the correct output and is possibly generating extra data.

The potential error location is likely within the `js_to_json` function, where there may be issues with the regular expressions or the transformation logic.

One possible reason for the bug is that the function `js_to_json` did not handle replacements accurately, leading to the generation of extra data and incorrect JSON output.

To fix the bug, the regular expressions and transformation logic within the `js_to_json` function must be carefully reviewed for any issues.

Here's the corrected code for the `js_to_json` function:

```python
import re
import json

def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
            return v
        if v.startswith('"'):
            return v
        if v.startswith("'"):
            v = v[1:-1]
            v = re.sub(r"\\\\|\\'|\"", lambda m: {
                '\\\\': '\\\\',
                "\\'": "'",
                '"': '\\"',
            }[m.group(0)], v)
            return '"%s"' % v

    res = re.sub(r'''(?x)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\")?)*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\')?)*'|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*
    ''', fix_kv, code)

    # Replace single quotes with double quotes
    res = res.replace("'", '"')

    # Remove whitespace before closing brackets
    res = re.sub(r',(\s*(\]|\}))', lambda m: m.group(1), res)

    return res
```

In the corrected code, after the initial replacement using the `fix_kv` function, single quotes are globally replaced with double quotes, and any whitespace before closing brackets is removed. This should produce the desired JSON-like output without any extra data.
