The error is likely caused by an incorrect translation of the JSON string, leading to unexpected characters and structure in the resulting JSON. The "js_to_json" function is responsible for parsing a JavaScript-like code string and converting it to a JSON equivalent. The issue may be related to the way it handles string quotations and special characters.

Upon reviewing the code, it seems that the "js_to_json" function incorrectly handles string values and special characters, which is causing the translation to produce invalid JSON. The incorrect processing of the string values and special characters is evident from the "fix_kv" function, where the handling of different cases for string values and escaping characters is implemented.

To fix this bug, you can use the "re.sub" function directly with lambda functions for replacements, without the need for the "fix_kv" function. This would simplify the code and help avoid errors related to the incorrect processing of string values and special characters.

Here's the corrected code for the "js_to_json" function:

```python
import re

def js_to_json(code):
    # Implementing the correct conversion of JavaScript-like code to JSON
    res = re.sub(r'"[^"\\]*(?:\\.[^"\\]*)*"|\'[^\'\\]*(?:\\.[^\'\\]*)*\'|([a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*)',
                 lambda m: m.group(0) if m.group(0) in ('true', 'false', 'null')
                           else m.group(0).replace("'", '"')
                           if m.group(0).startswith("'")
                           else f'"{m.group(0)}"'
                 , code)
    res = re.sub(r',(\s*])', lambda m: m.group(1), res)
    return res
```

By directly using lambda functions within the "re.sub" calls, we handle all the cases (true/false/null and strings), including escaping of special characters and converting single quotes to double quotes. This should result in the correct translation of the JavaScript-like code to valid JSON, resolving the error observed during the test.
