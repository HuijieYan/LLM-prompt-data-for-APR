The error message indicates that the `json.loads` method is encountering extra data, which suggests that the output of the `js_to_json` method is not in the correct JSON format, causing the `json.loads` method to fail.

Upon analyzing the `js_to_json` function, it seems that the `fix_kv` method is the potential error location. The error is most likely caused by the incorrect replacement of single quotes with double quotes.

To fix this bug:
1. Use the `re` module to replace occurrences of `'` with `"` in the input `code`.
2. Use a mapping between escape sequences like `\\`, `\'`, and `\"` to their respective replacements.

The corrected code for the `js_to_json` function is as follows:

```python
import re
import json

def fix_kv(m):
    v = m.group(0)
    if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
        return v
    if v.startswith('"'):
        return v
    if v.startswith("'"):
        v = v[1:-1]
        v = re.sub(r"\\\\|\\'|\"", lambda m: {
            '\\\\': '\\\\',
            "\\'": "'",
            '"': '\\"',
        }[m.group(0)], v)
        v = re.sub("'", '"', v)  # Replace single quotes with double quotes
    return '"%s"' % v

def js_to_json(code):
    res = re.sub(r'''(?x)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\")?)*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\')?)*'|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*''', fix_kv, code)
    res = re.sub(r',(\s*\])', lambda m: m.group(1), res)
    return res
```
