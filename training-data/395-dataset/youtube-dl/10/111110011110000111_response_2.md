The error message indicates that the 'json.loads' method is failing due to "Extra data" in the string. This implies that the output of the 'js_to_json' function is not correctly formatted as JSON.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the 'fix_kv' function, which is responsible for converting javascript keys and values to JSON format.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the 'fix_kv' function is not correctly handling the conversion of single quotes to double quotes for string values. Additionally, the regular expression used in the 'js_to_json' function might not be correctly capturing all the key-value pairs and may not be handling nested objects properly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the 'fix_kv' function to correctly convert single quotes to double quotes for string values and update the regular expression to properly capture key-value pairs and nested objects.

Here's the corrected code for the 'js_to_json' function:

```python
import re
import json

def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
            return v
        if v.startswith('"'):
            return v
        if v.startswith("'"):
            v = v[1:-1]
            v = re.sub(r'\\\\|\\\'|\"', lambda m: {
                '\\\\': '\\\\',
                "\\'": "'",
                '"': '\\"',
            }[m.group(0)], v)
            return '"%s"' % v
        return v  # return as is for object keys

    res = re.sub(r'''(?x)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\")?)*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\')?)*'|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*
        ''', fix_kv, code)
    res = re.sub(r',(?=\s*[\]}])', '', res)  # removes trailing comma before closing brackets for objects
    return res
```

With the corrected code, the 'js_to_json' function should handle the conversion of JavaScript code to JSON format correctly, and the test cases should pass without any errors.
