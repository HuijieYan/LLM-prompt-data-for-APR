The issue with the provided `js_to_json` function is that the `fix_kv` function is defined inside it, leading to an indentation problem. The `fix_kv` function should be defined outside the `js_to_json` function.

Furthermore, the variable `v` is being extracted from the matched group `m` but isn't being updated. Instead, it should be updated to remove single quotes and handle escape characters properly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def fix_kv(m):
    v = m.group(0)
    if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
        return v
    if v.startswith('"'):
        return v
    if v.startswith("'"):
        v = v[1:-1]
        v = re.sub(r"\\\\|\\'|\"", lambda m: {
            '\\\\': '\\\\',
            "\\'": "'",
            '"': '\\"',
        }[m.group(0)], v)
    return '"%s"' % v

def js_to_json(code):
    res = re.sub(r'''(?x)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\")?)*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\')?)*'|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*
        ''', fix_kv, code)
    res = re.sub(r',(\s*\])', lambda m: m.group(1), res)
    return res
```

In the corrected version, `fix_kv` is defined outside of the `js_to_json` function, and the `v` variable is properly updated to handle the escape characters and remove single quotes. This should resolve the issues identified in the function.
