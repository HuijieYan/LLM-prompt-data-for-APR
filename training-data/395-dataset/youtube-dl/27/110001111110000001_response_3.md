1. The test case '00:00:01:100' is failing with an AssertionError. The expected output is 1.1, but the actual output is None.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the second regular expression match for the time format '(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)' which is not correctly handling the milliseconds part of the time string.

3. The bug is occurring because the second regular expression match is not correctly capturing the milliseconds part of the time string. As a result, the function is not able to convert the time string to the appropriate seconds value.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the second regular expression match to correctly capture the milliseconds part of the time string. Additionally, we need to handle the case when the time string format does not match any of the regular expressions.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def parse_dfxp_time_expr(time_expr):
    if not time_expr:
        return

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<time_offset>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)s?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return float(mobj.group('time_offset'))

    mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d)(?:\.(\d+))?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        hours = int(mobj.group(1))
        minutes = int(mobj.group(2))
        seconds = int(mobj.group(3))
        milliseconds = float(mobj.group(4)) if mobj.group(4) else 0
        return 3600 * hours + 60 * minutes + seconds + milliseconds
    
    # return None if the time string format does not match any of the regular expressions
    return None
```
