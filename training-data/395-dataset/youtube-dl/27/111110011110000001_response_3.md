The test case that fails is `self.assertEqual(parse_dfxp_time_expr('00:00:01:100'), 1.1)`. The error message indicates that the function is returning `None` instead of the expected value of `1.1`.

The potential error in the code is that the second regular expression used to match the time expression containing hours, minutes, and seconds is incorrect. It is using `:` as the delimiter between hours, minutes, and seconds, but in the test case that fails, the time expression is using `:` and `.` as delimiters.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the regular expression is not able to correctly match the time expression '00:00:01:100' and consequently the function returns `None`.

To fix the bug, the regular expression needs to be modified to account for both `:` and `.` as the delimiters. Additionally, the grouping pattern in the regular expression needs to be corrected to capture the hours, minutes, and seconds properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `parse_dfxp_time_expr` function:

```python
import re

def parse_dfxp_time_expr(time_expr):
    if not time_expr:
        return

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<time_offset>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)s?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return float(mobj.group('time_offset'))

    mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d+):(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return 3600 * int(mobj.group(1)) + 60 * int(mobj.group(2)) + float(mobj.group(3))
```

With the above correction, the function should now be able to correctly parse the time expression '00:00:01:100' and return the expected value of `1.1`, resolving the test failure.
