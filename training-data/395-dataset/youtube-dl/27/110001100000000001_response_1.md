Potential error location: The second regular expression used to match the time_expr format is incorrect.

Reason behind the bug: The second regular expression used in the function does not correctly capture the time offset in the format specified.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Update the second regular expression to correctly capture the time offset in the format "hh:mm:ss" or "hh:mm:ss.s".
- Use named groups in the regular expression to make it more readable and maintainable.

```python
import re

def parse_dfxp_time_expr(time_expr):
    if not time_expr:
        return

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<time_offset>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)s?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return float(mobj.group('time_offset'))

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<hours>\d+):(?P<minutes>\d\d):(?P<seconds>\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return 3600 * int(mobj.group('hours')) + 60 * int(mobj.group('minutes')) + float(mobj.group('seconds'))
```
Corrected code for the problematic function. The second regular expression has been updated to correctly capture the time offset in the format "hh:mm:ss" or "hh:mm:ss.s". Additionally, named groups have been used in the regular expression for better readability and maintainability.
