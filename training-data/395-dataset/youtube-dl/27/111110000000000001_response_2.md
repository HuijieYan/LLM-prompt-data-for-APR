Potential Error:
The potential error in the code is that the 're' module is being used without being imported in the function. The 're' module is needed for the regular expression matching, but it is not imported in the code.

Reason for the Bug:
The code is using regular expressions without importing the 're' module, which leads to the "NameError" as the 're' module is not recognized.

Approach to Fix the Bug:
The 're' module needs to be imported at the beginning of the function to use regular expression matching.

Corrected Code:
```python
import re

def parse_dfxp_time_expr(time_expr):
    if not time_expr:
        return

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<time_offset>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)s?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return float(mobj.group('time_offset'))

    mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return 3600 * int(mobj.group(1)) + 60 * int(mobj.group(2)) + float(mobj.group(3))
```
