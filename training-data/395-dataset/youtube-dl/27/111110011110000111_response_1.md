1. The test case `test_parse_dfxp_time_expr` is checking the behavior of the `parse_dfxp_time_expr` function for different input time expressions. The error message indicates that there is an assertion failure when the time expression '00:00:01:100' is passed to the function.

2. The potential error location within the `parse_dfxp_time_expr` function is the second regex match block that tries to match the time expression in the format `(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)`.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the second regex match block does not handle the input time expression '00:00:01:100' correctly. It should return None for this input, but it currently does not handle this case.

4. To fix the bug, an additional check needs to be added after the second regex match block to return None for invalid time expressions. This will ensure that the function behaves correctly for all input time expressions.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `parse_dfxp_time_expr` function:

```python
import re

def parse_dfxp_time_expr(time_expr):
    if not time_expr:
        return

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<time_offset>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)s?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return float(mobj.group('time_offset'))

    mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        seconds = 3600 * int(mobj.group(1)) + 60 * int(mobj.group(2)) + float(mobj.group(3))
        if seconds >= 0:  # Additional check to handle invalid time expressions
            return seconds

    return None  # Return None for invalid time expressions
```

With this modification, the `parse_dfxp_time_expr` function will handle invalid time expressions correctly and return None for those cases.
