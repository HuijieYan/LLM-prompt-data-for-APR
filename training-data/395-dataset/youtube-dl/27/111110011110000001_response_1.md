The test case '00:00:01:100' is resulting in an assertion error. This suggests that the function is not behaving as expected for this test case.

The potential error location within the function is the second regex match statement:
```python
mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)$', time_expr)
```

The reason for the bug is that the regex pattern in the second match statement is not correctly matching the input '00:00:01:100'. The current pattern is expecting format like '00:00:01.100' and not '00:00:01:100'. This causes the function to return None instead of the expected result.

To fix this bug, we need to update the regex pattern in the second match statement to handle the input '00:00:01:100'.

Here's the corrected function with the updated regex pattern:

```python
import re

def parse_dfxp_time_expr(time_expr):
    if not time_expr:
        return

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<time_offset>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)s?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return float(mobj.group('time_offset'))

    mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d)(?::(\d+(?:\.\d+)?))?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        hours = int(mobj.group(1))
        minutes = int(mobj.group(2))
        seconds = int(mobj.group(3))
        milliseconds = float(mobj.group(4)) if mobj.group(4) else 0.0
        return 3600 * hours + 60 * minutes + seconds + milliseconds
```
