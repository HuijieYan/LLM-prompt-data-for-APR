The buggy function is `parse_dfxp_time_expr()` which is used in the process of converting dfxp (TTML) subtitles into another format. The function uses regular expressions to match different time formats and return the corresponding time offset.

After analyzing the test cases and their expected results, it seems that the function is not returning any value when the time matches the expected formats. This could be the reason for the "style information loss" warning and the subsequent KeyError when converting dfxp to srt.

To fix this bug, the function needs to return a default value when the time format does not match the expected patterns. This will ensure that the function always returns a value, even if it's just `None` in case of a mismatch.

Here's the corrected code for the `parse_dfxp_time_expr()` function:

```python
import re

def parse_dfxp_time_expr(time_expr):
    if not time_expr:
        return None  # return default value if input is empty

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<time_offset>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)s?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return float(mobj.group('time_offset'))

    mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return 3600 * int(mobj.group(1)) + 60 * int(mobj.group(2)) + float(mobj.group(3))

    return None  # return default value if no match is found
```

With this correction, the function will always return a value, ensuring that there is no style information loss during the conversion process.
