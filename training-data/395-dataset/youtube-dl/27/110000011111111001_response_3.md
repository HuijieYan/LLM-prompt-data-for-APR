The error occurs when the input time expression is in the format '00:00:01:100', as the function does not account for this format.

The bug is occurring because the function is not returning a value for the case when the time expression is in the format '00:00:01:100'. Instead, it returns None, which causes the test to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to add an additional check for the time expression in the format '00:00:01:100' and return the calculated value.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import re

def parse_dfxp_time_expr(time_expr):
    if not time_expr:
        return

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<time_offset>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)s?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return float(mobj.group('time_offset'))

    mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return 3600 * int(mobj.group(1)) + 60 * int(mobj.group(2)) + float(mobj.group(3))
    
    mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d):(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return 3600 * int(mobj.group(1)) + 60 * int(mobj.group(2)) + int(mobj.group(3)) + float(mobj.group(4))
```

With this correction, the function should now return the correct values for all the given test cases.
