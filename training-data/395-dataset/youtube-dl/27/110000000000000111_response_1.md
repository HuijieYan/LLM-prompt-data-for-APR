The error appears to be related to the conversion of DFXP (TTML) subtitles to SRT format. The error message specifically mentions a "KeyError: u'dur'", which indicates that there is an issue with accessing the 'dur' key in the subtitle data, likely within the `dfxp2srt` function.

Upon reviewing the provided code, it seems that the function `parse_dfxp_time_expr` is not directly related to the error mentioned in the GitHub issue. The provided function is responsible for parsing time expressions in DFXP format, but the error seems to be occurring during the conversion process in the `dfxp2srt` function.

Possible approaches to fix the bug would involve identifying and addressing the root cause of the "KeyError: u'dur'" issue within the `dfxp2srt` function. This could involve checking for the presence of the 'dur' key in the subtitle data before accessing it, handling cases where the 'dur' key is not present, or updating the parsing logic to correctly interpret DFXP format.

As for the provided function `parse_dfxp_time_expr`, it appears to be working correctly for parsing DFXP time expressions. However, it does not directly relate to the error reported in the GitHub issue. If there are other issues related to DFXP parsing, they would need to be investigated separately.

Here is the corrected code for the `parse_dfxp_time_expr` function:

```python
import re

def parse_dfxp_time_expr(time_expr):
    if not time_expr:
        return 0.0  # Changed to return a default value in case time_expr is empty

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<time_offset>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)s?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return float(mobj.group('time_offset'))

    mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return 3600 * int(mobj.group(1)) + 60 * int(mobj.group(2)) + float(mobj.group(3))

    return 0.0  # Added a default return value in case none of the patterns match
```
