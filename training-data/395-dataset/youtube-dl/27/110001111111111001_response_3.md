The problem arises from the fact that the function does not have a return statement when the `time_expr` is in the correct format, specifically when it matches the second regex pattern.

The bug occurs because when the input time_expr is in the format '00:00:01:100', the function matches the second regex pattern, but it does not return the calculated value.

To fix the bug, the function should return the calculated value in all cases. This can be achieved by adding a return statement after the calculation in the second regex match.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import re

def parse_dfxp_time_expr(time_expr):
    if not time_expr:
        return

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<time_offset>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)s?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return float(mobj.group('time_offset'))

    mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return 3600 * int(mobj.group(1)) + 60 * int(mobj.group(2)) + float(mobj.group(3))
```

With this correction, the function will always return the calculated value, regardless of which regex pattern is matched. This should resolve the AssertionError in the test case.
