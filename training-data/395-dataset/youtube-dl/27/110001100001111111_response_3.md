The provided function `parse_dfxp_time_expr` is used for parsing time expressions, which is relevant to the TTML to SRT conversion error mentioned in the issue description. The error is likely occurring due to the incorrect parsing of time expressions in the TTML format.

Based on the analysis of the test cases and the error message, it seems that the bug may be located in the `parse_dfxp_time_expr` function, specifically in the parsing and conversion of time expressions from the TTML format.

The bug is likely occurring because the function is not handling all the possible cases of time expressions in the TTML format, which is leading to the KeyError in the error message.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to handle all the possible cases of time expressions in the TTML format and ensure that it does not result in any key errors during the conversion process.

Below is the corrected code for the `parse_dfxp_time_expr` function:

```python
import re

def parse_dfxp_time_expr(time_expr):
    if not time_expr:
        return 0
    
    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<time_offset>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)s?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return float(mobj.group('time_offset'))

    mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return 3600 * int(mobj.group(1)) + 60 * int(mobj.group(2)) + float(mobj.group(3))

    raise ValueError("Invalid time expression format")

```

In the corrected code, an additional check has been added to handle invalid time expression formats by raising a ValueError. This ensures that the function handles all possible cases and does not result in key errors during the conversion process.
