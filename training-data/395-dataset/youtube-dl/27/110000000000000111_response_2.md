Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is within the `parse_dfxp_time_expr` function. This function is responsible for parsing time expressions in a specific format.

Reason for the Bug:
The error message indicates that there is a KeyError for the 'dur' key. This suggests that the function is not handling the time expressions correctly, which results in a key error when converting dfxp (TTML) subtitles into another format.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. The function should be modified to handle the time expressions correctly and avoid the key error that is occurring during the conversion process.
2. Ensure that the function is able to correctly parse time expressions in dfxp format and return the appropriate time offset.

Corrected Code:
```python
import re

def parse_dfxp_time_expr(time_expr):
    if not time_expr:
        return None

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<time_offset>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)s?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return float(mobj.group('time_offset'))

    mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return 3600 * int(mobj.group(1)) + 60 * int(mobj.group(2)) + float(mobj.group(3))

    # Add a default return value in case none of the patterns match
    return None
```
