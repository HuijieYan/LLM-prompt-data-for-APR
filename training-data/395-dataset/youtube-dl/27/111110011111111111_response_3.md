The bug is occurring in the `parse_dfxp_time_expr` function. The function is not returning any value for some of the input cases, causing assertion errors in the test cases.

The potential error location is the missing return statement for the cases where the regex matches successfully, but the function does not return any value.

The bug occurs because the function does not have a return statement if neither of the regex patterns match the `time_expr`. This causes the function to implicitly return `None`, leading to assertion errors in the test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to add a return statement at the end of the function that covers the case where neither of the regex patterns match. This return statement should handle the default case when no match is found.

Here's the corrected code for the `parse_dfxp_time_expr` function:

```python
import re

def parse_dfxp_time_expr(time_expr):
    if not time_expr:
        return

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<time_offset>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)s?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return float(mobj.group('time_offset'))

    mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return 3600 * int(mobj.group(1)) + 60 * int(mobj.group(2)) + float(mobj.group(3))

    # Add a return statement for the default case
    return None
```

With this fix, the function will return `None` when no match is found for the input `time_expr`, and the test cases should pass without any assertion errors.
