The error message from the test function indicates that for the input '00:00:01:100', the function `parse_dfxp_time_expr` returns None instead of 1.1, causing the assertion error. This suggests that the function is not correctly parsing time expressions in the format 'HH:MM:SS:MS'.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the second regular expression match:

```python
mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)$', time_expr)
```

This pattern is used to match time expressions in the format 'HH:MM:SS:MS'. The issue seems to be that the regular expression is not designed to handle this specific format, resulting in a None return value and causing the assertion error in the test case.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the regular expression pattern and its logic do not properly handle the format 'HH:MM:SS:MS' for time expressions, leading to incorrect parsing.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the second regular expression pattern to correctly handle the format 'HH:MM:SS:MS' for time expressions. We can modify the pattern to capture the milliseconds part separately and ensure the correct groupings are returned.

Here's the corrected code for the `parse_dfxp_time_expr` function:

```python
import re

def parse_dfxp_time_expr(time_expr):
    if not time_expr:
        return

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<time_offset>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)s?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return float(mobj.group('time_offset'))

    mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d)(?::(\d+)(?:\.\d+)?)?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        hours = int(mobj.group(1))
        minutes = int(mobj.group(2))
        seconds = int(mobj.group(3))
        milliseconds = float(mobj.group(4) or 0)
        return 3600 * hours + 60 * minutes + seconds + (milliseconds / 1000)
```

With this corrected code, the `parse_dfxp_time_expr` function should now correctly parse time expressions in the format 'HH:MM:SS:MS' and return the expected results for the provided test cases.
