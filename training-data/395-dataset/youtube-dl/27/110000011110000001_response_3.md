Potential Error Location:
The bug is likely in the second regex match `mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)$', time_expr)`.

Reason for Bug:
The second regex match does not handle the case where the time_expr is in the format `hh:mm:ss.sss`. It only handles the format `h:mm:ss.sss`, which causes the error.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
The second regex match should be modified to handle the hours section properly to account for cases where there are leading zeros.

Corrected Code:
```python
import re

def parse_dfxp_time_expr(time_expr):
    if not time_expr:
        return

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<time_offset>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)s?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return float(mobj.group('time_offset'))

    mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return 3600 * int(mobj.group(1)) + 60 * int(mobj.group(2)) + float(mobj.group(3))
    else:
        return None  # Return None if the time_expr does not match any of the regex patterns
```
