1. The test case `self.assertEqual(parse_dfxp_time_expr('00:00:01:100'), 1.1)` fails with an assertion error because the function `parse_dfxp_time_expr` returns `None` instead of the expected value `1.1`.

2. The potential error location in the function is the second regular expression match: `mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)$', time_expr)`. This regex pattern is not able to match the time format '00:00:01:100' correctly, resulting in the function returning `None`.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the second regular expression match is not able to handle the time format '00:00:01:100' as it expects the millisecond value to appear after a period. The time format provided in the failing test case does not match this expectation, causing the function to return `None`.

4. To fix the bug, the regular expression pattern for matching the time format 'HH:MM:SS.MS' should be updated to handle the case where the millisecond value is separated by a colon instead of a period.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `parse_dfxp_time_expr` function:

```python
import re

def parse_dfxp_time_expr(time_expr):
    if not time_expr:
        return

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<time_offset>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)s?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return float(mobj.group('time_offset'))

    mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d)(?::(\d+)(?:\.\d+)?)?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        hours, minutes, seconds, milliseconds = mobj.groups(default='0')
        return 3600 * int(hours) + 60 * int(minutes) + int(seconds) + float(milliseconds) / 1000
```

With this update, the function will be able to handle the time format 'HH:MM:SS:MS' correctly and return the expected values for the provided test cases.
