Potential Error Location:
The error seems to be related to the conversion of TTML (dfxp) subtitle format to SRT format. The error occurs specifically in the function `dfxp2srt`, which is not provided in the original code snippet, but it is called from the youtube-dl process. The error message indicates a KeyError related to the 'dur' attribute, which suggests a problem with parsing the time expressions in the TTML format.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug is likely related to the parsing of time expressions within the TTML format. It's possible that the `parse_dfxp_time_expr` function is not handling all possible time expressions correctly, leading to a KeyError when converting from TTML to SRT format.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the `parse_dfxp_time_expr` function handles all possible time expressions in the TTML format, including different formats and attributes such as 'dur'.
2. Implement robust error handling within the function to prevent unexpected key errors during the conversion process.
3. Validate the time expressions in the TTML format to ensure they conform to expected patterns before processing them.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:
```python
import re

def parse_dfxp_time_expr(time_expr):
    if not time_expr:
        return 0

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<time_offset>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)s?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return float(mobj.group('time_offset'))

    mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return 3600 * int(mobj.group(1)) + 60 * int(mobj.group(2)) + float(mobj.group(3))

    # Handle 'dur' attribute in TTML format
    mobj = re.match(r'^dur=(?P<time_offset>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)s?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return float(mobj.group('time_offset'))

    # Handle other TTML time expression formats if necessary

    # If no matches, return 0 or handle the error condition as needed
    return 0
```

Please note that the corrected code assumes that the TTML format might include a 'dur' attribute for time expressions, and it provides a generic handling for this attribute. The actual implementation may vary based on specific TTML format requirements.
