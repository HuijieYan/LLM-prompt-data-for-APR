Potential error location: The bug seems to be in the regular expression matching for the second time format (HH:MM:SS).

Reason for the bug: The regular expression for the second time format is incorrect, as it does not account for the possibility of having a time offset with a decimal point.

Approach for fixing the bug: Update the regular expression to correctly match the second time format and handle the possibility of a decimal in the seconds part.

Corrected code:

```python
import re

def parse_dfxp_time_expr(time_expr):
    if not time_expr:
        return

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<time_offset>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)s?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return float(mobj.group('time_offset'))

    mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d{2}):(\d{2}(?:\.\d+)?)$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return 3600 * int(mobj.group(1)) + 60 * int(mobj.group(2)) + float(mobj.group(3))
```
