The error message indicates a KeyError in the function `dfxp2srt`, which suggests that there is a problem related to the conversion of dfxp (TTML) subtitles to SRT format. 

Upon analyzing the code, it is found that the function `parse_dfxp_time_expr` is not properly parsing the time expression in the TTML format, which might be causing the conversion error.

The bug is occurring because the regular expression patterns used in the `parse_dfxp_time_expr` function are not handling all possible TTML time expression formats correctly. This is leading to incorrect parsing of the time expressions, which results in the conversion error.

To fix the bug, the `parse_dfxp_time_expr` function needs to be updated to correctly handle all possible TTML time expression formats.

Here's the corrected code for the `parse_dfxp_time_expr` function:

```python
import re

def parse_dfxp_time_expr(time_expr):
    if not time_expr:
        return

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<time_offset>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)s?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return float(mobj.group('time_offset'))

    mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d)(?:\.(\d+))?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        hours = int(mobj.group(1))
        minutes = int(mobj.group(2))
        seconds = int(mobj.group(3))
        milliseconds = int(mobj.group(4)) if mobj.group(4) is not None else 0
        return 3600 * hours + 60 * minutes + seconds + milliseconds / 1000.0
```

In the corrected code, the second regular expression pattern has been updated to correctly capture hours, minutes, seconds, and optional milliseconds. Additionally, the calculation for total seconds has been adjusted to account for the milliseconds if present.
