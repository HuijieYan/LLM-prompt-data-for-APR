The test case `self.assertEqual(parse_dfxp_time_expr('00:00:01:100'), 1.1)` is failing with the error `AssertionError: None != 1.1`. This suggests that the function `parse_dfxp_time_expr` is returning `None` for the input `'00:00:01:100'` instead of the expected output of `1.1`. 

The potential error location within the `parse_dfxp_time_expr` function is likely in the second regex match:
```python
mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)$', time_expr)
```
This regex is used to parse the time expression in the format `hh:mm:ss.sss`. However, the regex pattern does not account for the possibility of a second colon appearing in the time expression, leading to the incorrect output of `None`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the regex pattern `^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)$` only matches time expressions with two colons (e.g., `00:00:01.100`), but it does not match time expressions with more than two colons (e.g., `00:00:01:100`). This results in the regex not matching and returning `None` for these time expressions.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the regex pattern to include an optional third group separated by a colon to match time expressions with optional milliseconds. The correct time regex should be:
```python
mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(?::\d+)?)$', time_expr)
```
With this modification, the function should correctly match and parse the time expressions with optional milliseconds.

Here's the corrected code for the `parse_dfxp_time_expr` function with the fix applied:

```python
import re

def parse_dfxp_time_expr(time_expr):
    if not time_expr:
        return

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<time_offset>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)s?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return float(mobj.group('time_offset'))

    mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(?::\d+)?)$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return 3600 * int(mobj.group(1)) + 60 * int(mobj.group(2)) + float(mobj.group(3))
```

With this corrected function, the test case and the associated GitHub issue should be resolved.
