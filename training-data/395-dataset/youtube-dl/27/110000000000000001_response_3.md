Potential error location: The potential error location is within the second regular expression match using re.match() function.

Reason behind the bug: The bug occurs because the second regular expression match is missing the named group 'time_offset' and is using group numbering instead.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Use named groups in the second regular expression match and return the calculated time value outside of the if conditions to ensure that the function returns a value in all cases.

Corrected code:

```python
import re

def parse_dfxp_time_expr(time_expr):
    if not time_expr:
        return None

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<time_offset>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)s?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return float(mobj.group('time_offset'))

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<hours>\d+):(?P<minutes>\d\d):(?P<seconds>\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        hours = int(mobj.group('hours'))
        minutes = int(mobj.group('minutes'))
        seconds = float(mobj.group('seconds'))
        return 3600 * hours + 60 * minutes + seconds

    return None
```
