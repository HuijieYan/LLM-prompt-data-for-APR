The test case "self.assertEqual(parse_dfxp_time_expr('00:00:01:100'), 1.1)" failed with the error "AssertionError: None != 1.1". This suggests that the function parse_dfxp_time_expr is not returning the expected result for the input '00:00:01:100'.

The potential error location within the function is the second regex matching condition:
mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)$', time_expr)

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the second regex matching condition is not correctly handling the time format '00:00:01:100', resulting in None being returned for this input.

To fix the bug, we can modify the second regex matching condition to correctly handle the time format '00:00:01:100' and return the floating-point representation of the timestamp.

Here's the corrected code for the parse_dfxp_time_expr function:

```python
import re

def parse_dfxp_time_expr(time_expr):
    if not time_expr:
        return

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<time_offset>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)s?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return float(mobj.group('time_offset'))

    mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d):?(\d+)?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        hours = int(mobj.group(1))
        minutes = int(mobj.group(2))
        seconds = int(mobj.group(3))
        milliseconds = int(mobj.group(4)) if mobj.group(4) else 0
        return 3600 * hours + 60 * minutes + seconds + milliseconds / 1000
```

This corrected function will now handle the time format '00:00:01:100' correctly and return the expected result.
