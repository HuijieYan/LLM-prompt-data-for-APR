The issue with the provided function is that it doesn't have a return statement for the case where the input does not match any of the patterns. Additionally, the `re` module has not been imported for using regular expressions.

Potential error location: The function does not handle the case where the input does not match any of the patterns.

Reason for the bug: The function is not returning a value for the case where the input does not match any of the patterns. Additionally, the `re` module has not been imported for using regular expressions.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Import the `re` module to use regular expressions.
2. Add a return statement at the end of the function to handle the case where the input does not match any of the patterns.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def parse_dfxp_time_expr(time_expr):
    if not time_expr:
        return 0

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<time_offset>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)s?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return float(mobj.group('time_offset'))

    mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return 3600 * int(mobj.group(1)) + 60 * int(mobj.group(2)) + float(mobj.group(3))
    
    # handle the case where the input does not match any of the patterns
    return 0
```
