The potential error in the function is that it doesn't have a return statement for all possible cases. It only returns a value if the time expression matches with the first regular expression pattern or the second one. If the time expression does not match with either of these patterns, the function will not return anything, which is not desired behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to add a return statement outside of the if-elif blocks to return a default value if the input time expression does not match either pattern. We can return None in this case to indicate that the input format is not recognized.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def parse_dfxp_time_expr(time_expr):
    if not time_expr:
        return None

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<time_offset>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)s?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return float(mobj.group('time_offset'))

    mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return 3600 * int(mobj.group(1)) + 60 * int(mobj.group(2)) + float(mobj.group(3))
    
    return None
```
