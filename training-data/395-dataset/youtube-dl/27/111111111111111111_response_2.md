Analysis:
The buggy function `parse_dfxp_time_expr` is supposed to parse a time expression and return its value in seconds. However, the function does not handle all the cases properly, leading to incorrect output in some scenarios. This causes the associated test case to fail. 

The issue is likely occurring in the second `re.match` block where it tries to match the format `(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)`. This block is used to match time expressions in the format HH:MM:SS or HH:MM:SS.SSS. However, the regex pattern is incorrect and does not account for the optional milliseconds part.

Additionally, when the second `re.match` block matches successfully, it calculates the time in seconds incorrectly. The function does not account for the milliseconds part and does not convert it to seconds properly.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the regex pattern in the second `re.match` block to handle the optional milliseconds part.
2. Modify the calculation for converting the time expression to seconds to correctly account for the milliseconds.

Corrected Code:
```python
import re

def parse_dfxp_time_expr(time_expr):
    if not time_expr:
        return

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<time_offset>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)s?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return float(mobj.group('time_offset'))

    mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d\d):(\d\d)(?:\.(\d+))?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        hours = int(mobj.group(1))
        minutes = int(mobj.group(2))
        seconds = int(mobj.group(3))
        milliseconds = int(mobj.group(4) or 0)
        return 3600 * hours + 60 * minutes + seconds + milliseconds / 1000

# Test cases remain unchanged
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly parse time expressions in the specified formats and return their value in seconds. The associated test cases should also pass without any assertion errors.
