Potential Error Location: The potential error is in the second regex pattern matching with time_expr. There seems to be an issue in the grouping and capturing of the time format.

Reasons Behind the Bug: The bug might be occurring due to incorrect regex pattern matching or grouping in the second part of the function.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: 
1. Modify the regex pattern to correctly capture the time format.
2. Use proper grouping to extract the hours, minutes, and seconds from the time expression.

Corrected Code:
```python
import re

def parse_dfxp_time_expr(time_expr):
    if not time_expr:
        return None

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<time_offset>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)s?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return float(mobj.group('time_offset'))

    mobj = re.match(r'^(\d+):(\d+):(\d+(?:\.\d+)?)$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return 3600 * int(mobj.group(1)) + 60 * int(mobj.group(2)) + float(mobj.group(3))
```
