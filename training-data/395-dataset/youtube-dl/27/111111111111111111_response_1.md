The input parameters and the expected results in the test cases are not consistent with the actual results. When the input of '00:00:01:100' is given, the function returns None instead of the expected 1.1. 

The bug is occurring because the regular expression matching for the '00:00:01:100' pattern is incorrect in the function. 

To fix the bug, the regular expression pattern for the '00:00:01:100' should be updated, and the correct time conversion should be implemented to return the expected results.

Here's the corrected code for the `parse_dfxp_time_expr` function:

```python
import re

def parse_dfxp_time_expr(time_expr):
    if not time_expr:
        return

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<hours>\d+):(?P<minutes>\d\d):(?P<seconds>\d\d(?:\.\d+)?)$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        hours = int(mobj.group('hours'))
        minutes = int(mobj.group('minutes'))
        seconds = float(mobj.group('seconds'))
        return 3600 * hours + 60 * minutes + seconds

    mobj = re.match(r'^(?P<time_offset>\d+(?:\.\d+)?)s?$', time_expr)
    if mobj:
        return float(mobj.group('time_offset'))
```

With this correction, the function should return the expected results for the given test cases.
