The error seems to be caused by the `js_to_json` function failing to properly handle the input and convert it into a valid JSON format. The error message indicates that the JSON decoder is unable to process the returned output.

Upon reviewing the `js_to_json` function, the potential error location appears to be in the `INTEGER_TABLE` definition and the subsequent processing of integers. The function is trying to handle various representations of integers in JavaScript, but the implementation is incorrect, leading to a failure in generating valid JSON.

The bug occurs because the regular expressions used to match and replace certain patterns in the JavaScript code do not handle all edge cases correctly. This leads to invalid JSON being generated, which causes the failure of the test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to rewrite the regexes and parsing logic to accurately handle different representations of strings, integers, and other JavaScript tokens.

Here's the corrected code for the `js_to_json` function:

```python
import re
import json

def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
            return v
        elif v.startswith('/*') or v == ',':
            return ""

        if v[0] in ("'", '"'):
            v = re.sub(r'(?s)\\.|"', lambda m: {
                '"': '\\"',
                "\\'": "'",
                '\\\n': '',
                '\\x': '\\u00',
            }.get(m.group(0), m.group(0)), v[1:-1])

        return json.dumps(v)

    return re.sub(r'''(?sx)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nurtbfx/\n]))*[^"\\]*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nurtbfx/\n]))*[^'\\]*'|
        /\*.*?\*/|,(?=\s*[\]}])|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*|
        \b(?:0[xX][0-9a-fA-F]+|0+[0-7]+)(?:\s*:)?|
        [0-9]+(?=\s*:)
        ''', fix_kv, code)
```

This corrected code uses the `json.dumps` function to ensure that all values are correctly converted to valid JSON strings, thereby resolving the issues with the integer handling and string representation.
