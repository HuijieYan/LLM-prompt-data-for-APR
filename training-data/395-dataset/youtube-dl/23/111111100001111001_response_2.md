The issue with the provided code is that the `fix_kv` function is nested inside the `js_to_json` function. This can cause problems when calling `re.sub` with `fix_kv` as the replacement function, as it is not directly accessible outside of `js_to_json`.

To fix this issue, the `fix_kv` function should be moved outside of the `js_to_json` function so it can be accessed globally.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/youtube-dl_23/youtube_dl/utils.py

import re

# Relative function's signature in this file
def fix_kv(m):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# This is the corrected function
def js_to_json(code):
    return re.sub(r'''(?sx)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nurtbfx/\n]))*[^"\\]*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nurtbfx/\n]))*[^'\\]*'|
        /\*.*?\*/|,(?=\s*[\]}])|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*|
        \b(?:0[xX][0-9a-fA-F]+|0+[0-7]+)(?:\s*:)?|
        [0-9]+(?=\s*:)
        ''', fix_kv, code)
```
