The error message indicates that the function `match_str` is not working as expected. Specifically, the call `self.assertFalse(match_str('is_live', {'is_live': False}))` is failing.

The function `_match_one` is failing to handle the case where the filter part is `'!is_live'` which should return `False` if the key `is_live` is present in the dictionary `dct`. 

The reason behind this bug is that the function fails to appropriately handle the unary operators `'!'` and `''`. It only considers the case where the key exists but does not consider the negation of it.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check for the `not` operation in the `_match_one` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `match_str` function:

```python
def _match_one(filter_part, dct):
    # Existing code

    # ... (rest of the code) ...

    UNARY_OPERATORS = {
        '': lambda v: v is not None,
        '!': lambda v: v is None,
    }
    
    # Check if the operation is unary NOT
    if filter_part[0] == '!':
        key = filter_part[1:]
        return UNARY_OPERATORS['!'](dct.get(key))
    else:
        operator_rex = re.compile(r'''(?x)\s*
            (?P<op>%s)\s*(?P<key>[a-z_]+)
            \s*$
            ''' % '|'.join(map(re.escape, UNARY_OPERATORS.keys())))
        m = operator_rex.search(filter_part)
        if m:
            op = UNARY_OPERATORS[m.group('op')]
            actual_value = dct.get(m.group('key'))
            return op(actual_value)

    raise ValueError('Invalid filter part %r' % filter_part)
```
