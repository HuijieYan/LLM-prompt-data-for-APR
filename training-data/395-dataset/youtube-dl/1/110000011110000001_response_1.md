The error message indicates that the test case for the `match_str` function is failing. Specifically, the assertion `self.assertFalse(match_str('is_live', {'is_live': False}))` is failing with the error `AssertionError: True is not false`.

Based on the error message and the test case, the bug is likely located in the implementation of the `match_str` function. The function `_match_one` likely contains the bug as it is being called within the `match_str` function.

The bug is likely occurring due to some incorrect comparisons or logical operations within the `_match_one` function, resulting in incorrect boolean results being returned.

To fix this bug, an approach would be to carefully review and debug the `_match_one` function to ensure that the comparisons and logical operations within it are correctly implemented to return the expected boolean results.

Here is the corrected code for the `_match_one` function:

```python
import re
import operator

def _match_one(filter_part, dct):
    COMPARISON_OPERATORS = {
        '<': operator.lt,
        '<=': operator.le,
        '>': operator.gt,
        '>=': operator.ge,
        '=': operator.eq,
        '!=': operator.ne,
    }

    # ... (existing code)

    # After performing necessary operations and comparisons, return boolean results
    if actual_value is None:
        if m.group('none_inclusive') is not None:
            return True  # Assuming 'none_inclusive' indicates a case of "is not None"
        else:
            return False  # Assuming 'none_inclusive' is not provided and should be treated as a regular comparison

    return op(actual_value, comparison_value)
```

This version of the function includes explicit checks and return values for boolean results based on the comparison operations. Additionally, the handling of `none_inclusive` is adjusted based on the assumption that it represents the "is not None" condition, and the return values are adjusted accordingly.
