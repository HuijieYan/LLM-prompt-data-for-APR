The error seems to be related to the `match_str` function calling the `_match_one` function with a given filter and dictionary. The error message indicates that one of the assertions failed, specifically the one checking if `match_str('is_live', {'is_live': False})` returns `False`. However, the returned value seems to be `True` instead of `False`, causing the assertion to fail.

Looking at the `_match_one` function, the potential error location could be in the comparison logic that handles the different comparison cases, including comparing strings and integers.

The issue might be related to how comparison values are being processed and checked. It looks like the code is trying to handle various types of input values for comparison, but there might be a logical error in determining the comparison value and the way it is applied.

To fix the bug, we can revise the comparison logic in `_match_one` to ensure that the correct comparison value is extracted and compared with the actual value based on the given filter parts.

Here's the corrected code for the `_match_one` function:

```python
import operator
import re

def _match_one(filter_part, dct):
    # Comparison operators dictionary
    COMPARISON_OPERATORS = {
        '<': operator.lt,
        '<=': operator.le,
        '>': operator.gt,
        '>=': operator.ge,
        '=': operator.eq,
        '!=': operator.ne,
    }

    # Check for comparison operators in the filter part
    for op in COMPARISON_OPERATORS:
        if op in filter_part:
            parts = filter_part.split(op)
            key = parts[0].strip()
            value = parts[1].strip()

            if key in dct:
                if op in ('=', '!=') and isinstance(dct[key], str):
                    return COMPARISON_OPERATORS[op](str(dct[key]), value)
                else:
                    try:
                        return COMPARISON_OPERATORS[op](dct[key], int(value))
                    except ValueError:
                        pass

    # Handle the case when no comparison operator is found in the filter part
    if filter_part in dct:
        return dct[filter_part] is not None

    # Raise an error for invalid filter part
    raise ValueError('Invalid filter part %r' % filter_part)

```

It's important to note that this corrected code assumes that the `match_str` function works as expected and the dictionary `dct` contains relevant keys and values for comparison. If there are any issues with these assumptions, they might need to be addressed separately.
