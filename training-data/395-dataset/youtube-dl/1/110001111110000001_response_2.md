The test function is designed to check if the `match_str` function is working as expected. The test fails at `self.assertFalse(match_str('is_live', {'is_live': False}))` with the error message "AssertionError: True is not false".

The potential error location within the problematic function is the implementation of the `match_str` function. It seems that there is a bug in the implementation of the comparison operators and unary operators.

The bug occurs because the comparison and unary operators in the `_match_one` function are not handling the conditions properly. The issue is likely related to the way the `!` operator (negation) and the `&` operator (logical AND) are managed.

To fix the bug, the `_match_one` function needs to be rewritten to properly handle the comparison and unary operators. The function should also include the handling of logical operators.

Here's the corrected code for the `_match_one` function:

```python
# Corrected function
def _match_one(filter_part, dct):
    if '&' in filter_part:
        return all(_match_one(part, dct) for part in filter_part.split('&'))
    
    COMPARISON_OPERATORS = {
        '<': operator.lt,
        '<=': operator.le,
        '>': operator.gt,
        '>=': operator.ge,
        '=': operator.eq,
        '!=': operator.ne,
    }

    for operator, func in COMPARISON_OPERATORS.items():
        if operator in filter_part:
            key, value = filter_part.split(operator)
            actual_value = dct.get(key.strip())
            comparison_value = value.strip()

            if comparison_value.isdigit():
                comparison_value = int(comparison_value)
            else:
                try:
                    comparison_value = parse_filesize(comparison_value)
                except ValueError:
                    raise ValueError(f'Invalid comparison value {comparison_value}')
                
            return func(actual_value, comparison_value)

    if '!' in filter_part:
        key = filter_part[1:]
        actual_value = dct.get(key)
        return actual_value is None

    if filter_part in dct:
        return bool(dct[filter_part])

    raise ValueError('Invalid filter part %r' % filter_part)
```

With this corrected implementation, the `_match_one` function should now handle the comparison and unary operators as well as the logical AND operator. This should address the bug observed in the test function.
