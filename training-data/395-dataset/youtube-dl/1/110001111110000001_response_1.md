The test function is checking the behavior of the match_str function by providing different input conditions and checking the output. The error message shows that for the condition `match_str('is_live', {'is_live': False})`, the expected output was `False` but the actual output was `True`, resulting in an assertion error.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the actual value for the key `'is_live'`. It seems that the comparison of `False` value is not being handled correctly.

The reason behind the occurrence of this bug could be that the handling of boolean values is not consistent in the `_match_one` function. It does not have a separate case for handling boolean values.

One possible approach for fixing this bug is to explicitly check for boolean values in the `_match_one` function and handle comparisons between boolean values separately.

Here's the corrected code for the `match_str` function:

```python
def _match_one(filter_part, dct):
    # ... (previous code remains unchanged) ...

    BOOL_MAPPING = {
        True: 1,
        False: 0
    }

    if m.group('intval').lower() in ('true', 'false'):
        comparison_value = m.group('intval').lower() == 'true'
        actual_value = dct.get(m.group('key').lower())
        if actual_value is None:
            return m.group('none_inclusive')
        return op(BOOL_MAPPING.get(actual_value, actual_value), BOOL_MAPPING.get(comparison_value, comparison_value))

    # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged) ...
```

The above code includes a new boolean mapping and a condition to handle boolean (`True` or `False`) values. Instead of directly evaluating the comparison between boolean values, it first maps them to integer values and then compares them using the existing comparison operators. This ensures consistent handling of boolean values within the `_match_one` function.
