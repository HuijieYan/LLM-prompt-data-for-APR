The problem is with the `js_to_json` function, which is failing to properly convert JavaScript-style code to JSON. The function falls into bug cases 3 and 4 and doesn't work as expected. The issue stems from the `fix_kv` function, which is supposed to handle different cases for strings, booleans, and null. However, as observed from the error message, the function is not correctly handling the string conversions. 

To fix the bug, ensure that the `fix_kv` function correctly identifies and processes string values enclosed in single or double quotes. 

Here's the corrected `js_to_json` function:

```python
def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
            return v
        if v.startswith('"'):
            return v
        if v.startswith("'"):
            v = v[1:-1]
            v = re.sub(r"\\\\|\\'|\"", lambda m: {
                '\\\\': '\\\\',
                "\\'": "'",
                '"': '\\"',
            }[m.group(0)], v)
            return '"%s"' % v

    res = re.sub(r'''(?x)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nu]))*[^"\\]*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nu]))*[^'\\]*'|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*
        ''', fix_kv, code)
    res = re.sub(r',(\s*[\]}])', lambda m: m.group(1), res)
    return res
```

This corrected function should handle the cases for strings using both single and double quotes properly, ensuring that the conversion from JavaScript-style code to JSON is carried out correctly.
