The error is occurring because the function `js_to_json` is not correctly handling single quotes and escape characters within the input string. The `inp` strings in the test cases contain single quotes and escape characters, and the function is not processing them properly, leading to the AssertionError.

The potential error location within the function is the `fix_kv` function, where it should handle single quotes and escape characters appropriately.

The reason behind the bug is that the function `fix_kv` is not correctly handling the replacement of single quotes and escape characters. This leads to incorrect processing of the input string, resulting in the wrong output.

To fix the bug, the `fix_kv` function needs to be modified to properly handle single quotes and escape characters within the input string.

Here's the corrected code for the `js_to_json` function:

```python
import re
import json

def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
            return v
        if v.startswith('"'):
            return v
        if v.startswith("'"):
            v = v[1:-1]
            v = re.sub(r"\\\\|\\'|\"", lambda m: {
                '\\\\': '\\\\',
                "\\'": "'",
                '\"': '\\"',
            }[m.group(0)], v)
            v = v.replace("\\n", "\n")  # Handle newline characters
        return '"%s"' % v

    res = re.sub(r'''(?x)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nu]))*[^"\\]*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nu]))*[^'\\]*'|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*
        ''', fix_kv, code)
    res = re.sub(r',(\s*[\]}])', lambda m: m.group(1), res)
    return res
```

With this modified `js_to_json` function, the test cases should now pass without any AssertionError. The fix includes properly handling single quotes and escape characters within the input string and also handling newline characters.
