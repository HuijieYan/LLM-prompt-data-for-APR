The function `js_to_json` is expected to convert JavaScript-like code to JSON format. The test function is testing this behavior by providing different input and checking if the output matches the expected JSON format.

The error seems to be related to the handling of single quotes (`'`) in the input string. The current implementation is not correctly converting single quotes to JSON format, leading to the assertion error in the test case.

Based on the error message, it's clear that the bug is related to handling single quotes in the input string. The function is not converting single quotes to their JSON-encoded format correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the implementation to handle single quotes conversions properly. We can use the `replace` method to replace single quotes with their JSON-encoded format.

Here's the corrected `js_to_json` function:

```python
import re

def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
            return v
        if v.startswith('"'):
            return v
        if v.startswith("'"):
            # Replace single quotes with JSON-encoded format
            v = v.replace("\\'", "'")
            return '"%s"' % v

    res = re.sub(r'''(?x)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nu]))*[^"\\]*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nu]))*[^'\\]*'|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*
        ''', fix_kv, code)
    res = re.sub(r',(\s*[\]}])', lambda m: m.group(1), res)
    return res
```

With this corrected implementation, the single quotes will be properly encoded into the JSON format, and the test cases should pass without any assertion errors.
