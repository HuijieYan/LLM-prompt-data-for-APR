The bug seems to be related to the handling of single quotes and backslashes in the `js_to_json` function. The error occurs when the function is called with input containing single quotes and backslashes, and the assertion fails because the output is not as expected.

The issue seems to be in the `fix_kv` function inside the `js_to_json` function, specifically in the handling of single quotes and backslashes.

The reason for the bug is that the `fix_kv` function does not properly handle the single quotes and backslashes in the input string.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to modify the `fix_kv` function to properly handle the escaping of single quotes and backslashes.

Here's the corrected code for the `js_to_json` function:

```python
import re
import json

def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
            return v
        if v.startswith('"'):
            return v
        if v.startswith("'"):
            v = v[1:-1]
            v = re.sub(r"\\\\|\\'|\"", lambda m: {
                '\\\\': '\\\\',
                "\\'": "'",
                '"': '\\"',
            }[m.group(0)], v)
            v = v.replace("\\'", "'")  # Replace any remaining \' with just '
        return '"%s"' % v

    res = re.sub(r'''(?x)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"n]))*[^"\\]*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"n]))*[^'\\]*'|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*
        ''', fix_kv, code)
    res = re.sub(r',(\s*[\]}])', lambda m: m.group(1), res)
    return res
```

In this corrected code, we've added an extra line to the `fix_kv` function to replace any remaining `\\'` with just `'` after the initial substitution. With this change, the `js_to_json` function should now properly handle single quotes and backslashes and produce the expected output for the given test cases.
