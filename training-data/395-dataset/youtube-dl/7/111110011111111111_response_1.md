There are a few issues with the given `js_to_json` function. The main issue is that it is not correctly replacing single quotes with double quotes as expected when converting JavaScript objects to JSON. Additionally, the function is not handling escape sequences properly, which leads to the incorrect output in the test function.

The JavaScript to JSON conversion function can be fixed by using the `re` module to correctly handle single quotes, double quotes, and escape sequences in the input code.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
import re

def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
            return v
        if v.startswith('"') or v.startswith("'"):
            v = v.replace("\\'", "'").replace('\\"', '"')
            v = '"{}"'.format(v[1:-1])
        return v

    res = re.sub(r'''(?x)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nu]))*[^"\\]*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nu]))*[^'\\]*'|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*
        ''', fix_kv, code)
    res = re.sub(r',(\s*[\]}])', lambda m: m.group(1), res)
    return res
```

With this corrected function, the output of the test function should match the expected values for all test cases.
