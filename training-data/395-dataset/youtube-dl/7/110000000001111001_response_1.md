The bug in this function lies in the fix_kv function in the line where it checks for v.startswith("'"). This part of the code is trying to replace single quotes within the string but it should be using double quotes. 

The current approach is trying to handle escaping of single quotes and double quotes within the string. However, it is not handling cases where the string is enclosed in double quotes. It is also missing the 're' module import required for using regular expressions.

The suggested approach for fixing the bug is to modify the fix_kv function to properly handle both single and double quotes within the string and add the import statement for the 're' module.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re

def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
            return v
        if v.startswith('"'):
            return v
        if v.startswith("'"):
            v = v[1:-1]
            v = re.sub(r'\\.|["\']', lambda m: {
                '\\\\': '\\\\',
                "\\'": "'",
                '\\"': '"',
                "\"": '\\"',
                "\'": "\\'",
            }[m.group(0)], v)
        return '"%s"' % v

    res = re.sub(r'''(?x)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nu]))*[^"\\]*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nu]))*[^'\\]*'|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*
        ''', fix_kv, code)
    res = re.sub(r',(\s*[\]}])', lambda m: m.group(1), res)
    return res
```
