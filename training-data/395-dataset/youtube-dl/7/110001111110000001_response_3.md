The error seems to be caused by the `fix_kv` function within the `js_to_json` function, which is not correctly handling single quotes in the input string. The `fix_kv` function does not properly handle single quotes and escapes inside single quoted strings. This causes the assertion error when testing the input.

The `fix_kv` function needs to be modified to properly handle single quoted strings and their internal escapes.

Here's the corrected code for the `js_to_json` function:

```python
import re
import json

def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
            return v
        if v.startswith('"'):
            return v
        if v.startswith("'"):
            v = v[1:-1]
            v = re.sub(r'\\\\|\\\'|\"', lambda m: {
                '\\\\': '\\\\',
                "\\'": "'",
                '"': '\\"',
            }[m.group(0)], v)
            v = re.sub(r'\\\\', r'\\', v)  # add this line to handle escaped backslashes within single quoted strings
        return '"%s"' % v

    res = re.sub(r'''(?x)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nu]))*[^"\\]*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nu]))*[^'\\]*'|(?:[^"']|"[^"]*"|'[^']*')+
        ''', fix_kv, code)  # modify the regular expression pattern to match escaped characters within single quoted strings
    res = re.sub(r',(\s*[\]}])', lambda m: m.group(1), res)
    return res
```

In this corrected code, I have added a modification to the `fix_kv` function to handle escaped single quotes and backslashes within single quoted strings. I also modified the regular expression pattern to match these escaped characters within single quoted strings.
