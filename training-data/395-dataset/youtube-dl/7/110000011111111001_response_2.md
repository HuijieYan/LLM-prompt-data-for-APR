The buggy function `js_to_json` is intended to convert JavaScript-like code to JSON format. The function seems to be encountering issues with formatting strings and handling special characters.

The test case `test_js_to_json_realworld` is failing with the error message:
```
AssertionError: '"The CW\\\'s \\\'Crazy Ex-Girlfriend\\\'"' != '"The CW\'s \'Crazy Ex-Girlfriend\'"'
```
This indicates that the function is not correctly handling the conversion of certain strings containing escape characters.

The potential error location within the `js_to_json` function is the `fix_kv` function. It handles the conversion of key-value pairs, and the problem likely lies in the processing of escaped characters.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `fix_kv` function is not handling escaped characters correctly, leading to incorrect conversion of strings.

To fix the bug, the `fix_kv` function should be modified to correctly handle escaped characters and perform the necessary conversions. This can be achieved by properly evaluating and replacing escape sequences.

Here's the corrected code for the `js_to_json` function:

```python
import re
import json

def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
            return v
        if v.startswith('"'):
            return v
        if v.startswith("'"):
            v = v[1:-1]
            v = re.sub(r'\\\\', '\\\\', v)
            v = re.sub(r"\\'", "'", v)
            v = re.sub(r'\\"', '"', v)
            return '"%s"' % v

    res = re.sub(r'''(?x)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nu]))*[^"\\]*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nu]))*[^'\\]*'|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*
        ''', fix_kv, code)
    res = re.sub(r',(\s*[\]}])', lambda m: m.group(1), res)
    return res
```

With the provided fix, the `fix_kv` function now handles escaped characters such as `\\`, `\'`, and `\"` properly, ensuring correct conversion of JavaScript-like code to JSON format.
