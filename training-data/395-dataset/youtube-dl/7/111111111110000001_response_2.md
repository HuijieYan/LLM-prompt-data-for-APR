The bug is likely occurring in the `js_to_json` function, particularly in the `fix_kv` sub-function. The error message is showing a comparison between the expected and actual output of `js_to_json(inp)`, and the last assertion fails.

The `fix_kv` function is not correctly handling single quotes within the regex pattern. This is causing the issue with the single quote in the input string "The CW\\'s \\'Crazy Ex-Girlfriend\\'". The `fix_kv` function should be modified to correctly handle single quotes within the input to ensure the conversion to JSON format is done properly.

To fix this bug, the `fix_kv` function should be updated to properly handle single quotes within the input string by checking for their presence and handling the escaped versions of single quotes according to the JSON format.

Here's the corrected code for the `fix_kv` and `js_to_json` functions:

```python
import re
import json

def fix_kv(m):
    v = m.group(0)
    if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
        return v
    if v.startswith('"'):
        return v
    if v.startswith("'"):
        v = v[1:-1]
        v = re.sub(r"\\\\|\\'|\"", lambda m: {
            '\\\\': '\\\\',
            "\\'": "'",
            '"': '\\"',
        }[m.group(0)], v)
    return '"%s"' % v.strip()

def js_to_json(code):
    res = re.sub(r'''(?x)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nu]))*[^"\\]*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nu]))*[^'\\]*'|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*
        ''', fix_kv, code)
    res = re.sub(r',(\s*[\]}])', lambda m: m.group(1), res)
    return res
```

This corrected code should properly handle and convert the given input to valid JSON format, resolving the bug.
