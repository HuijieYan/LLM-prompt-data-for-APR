Potential error location: 
The potential error location is in the fix_kv function, specifically in the handling of single quotes ('), where it attempts to remove the single quotes and then replace escaped characters.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the fix_kv function is not properly handling single-quoted strings with escaped characters.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use a better approach to handle single-quoted strings with escaped characters.
2. Use a library or built-in function to handle the conversion from JavaScript to JSON, rather than implementing it manually.

Corrected code:

```python
import re
import json

def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
            return v
        if v.startswith('"'):
            return v
        if v.startswith("'"):
            v = v[1:-1]
            v = re.sub(r"\\(['\"/])", r"\1", v)  # Fix for handling escaped characters in single-quoted strings
            return json.dumps(v)  # Use json.dumps to handle special characters and convert to JSON string
        return '"%s"' % v

    res = re.sub(r'''(?x)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nu]))*[^"\\]*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nu]))*[^'\\]*'|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*
        ''', fix_kv, code)
    res = re.sub(r',(\s*[\]}])', lambda m: m.group(1), res)
    return res
```
