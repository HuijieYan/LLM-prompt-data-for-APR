The error occurs in the `js_to_json` function, specifically in the `fix_kv` nested function. The issue lies in the processing of single quotes (').

The bug occurs because the function is not correctly handling single quotes within the input string. The intention is to convert single quotes within the string to their corresponding escaped characters in JSON format, but the current implementation does not account for this properly.

To fix the bug, the `fix_kv` function needs to be modified to accurately handle single quotes within the input string. One approach is to use the `replace` method to replace single quotes with their escaped versions, and the `json.dumps` function to ensure correct JSON formatting overall.

Here's the corrected code for the `js_to_json` function:

```python
import json
import re

def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
            return v
        if v.startswith('"'):
            return v
        if v.startswith("'"):
            v = v[1:-1]
            v = json.dumps(v)
        return v

    res = re.sub(r'''(?x)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nu]))*[^"\\]*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nu]))*[^'\\]*'|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*
        ''', fix_kv, code)
    res = re.sub(r',(\s*[\]}])', lambda m: m.group(1), res)
    return res
```

With this implementation, the `fix_kv` function properly uses the `json.dumps` method to handle single quotes and ensure the correct formatting in JSON output. This should address the bug and allow the `js_to_json` function to operate as expected, passing the provided test cases.
