The error occurs in the function `js_to_json` where the single quotes are not being properly handled. The double quotes are being returned correctly, but single quotes are not being handled properly because of the regex used in the code.

The issue is with the regular expression used in the code. The regex is not able to handle single quotes properly, and the replacement is not being done correctly for single quotes causing the test case to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the regular expression and the replacement logic to handle single quotes correctly. This can be done by modifying the regex to handle both single and double quotes properly and updating the replacement logic to handle both cases.

Here's the corrected code for the `js_to_json` function:

```python
import re

def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
            return v
        if v.startswith('"'):
            return v
        if v.startswith("'"):
            v = v[1:-1]
            v = re.sub(r'\\\\|\\\'|"', lambda m: {
                '\\\\': '\\\\',
                "\\'": "'",
                '"': '\\"',
            }[m.group(0)], v)
            v = re.sub(r"'", r"\\'", v)  # replace single quotes with escaped single quotes
            return "'" + v + "'"
    
    res = re.sub(r'''(?x)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nu]))*[^"\\]*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nu]))*[^'\\]*'|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*
        ''', fix_kv, code)
    res = re.sub(r',(\s*[\]}])', lambda m: m.group(1), res)
    return res
```
