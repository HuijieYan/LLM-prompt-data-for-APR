It appears that the function `js_to_json` is attempting to convert JavaScript code to JSON format. However, the code is not handling all cases properly, leading to incorrect output.

The potential error location within the function is the `fix_kv` nested function, where the replacement of single quotes and backslashes within string values appears to be incorrect.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `fix_kv` function is not correctly handling the replacement of single quotes and backslashes within string values.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to use the `json` module in Python, which provides a method called `loads` (load string) that can be used to parse JSON data. This would avoid the need for custom string manipulation in the `fix_kv` function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function using the `json` module:

```python
import json

def js_to_json(code):
    return json.loads(code)
```
