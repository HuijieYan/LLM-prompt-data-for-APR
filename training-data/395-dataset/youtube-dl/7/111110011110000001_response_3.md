The error message shows that the expected output and the actual output do not match for the input string `"The CW\\'s \\'Crazy Ex-Girlfriend\\'"`. The problem seems to be related to the handling of escape characters and quotes in the input string.

Looking at the `js_to_json` function, the issue seems to be with the handling of single quotes and escape characters. The function uses regular expressions to match different patterns and then applies the `fix_kv` function for replacements.

The bug occurs because the function fails to properly handle single quotes and their escaped versions.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `fix_kv` function to properly handle single quotes and their escaped versions. Also, the second `re.sub` operation should handle single quotes and other special characters properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `js_to_json` function:

```python
import re
import json

def js_to_json(code):
    def fix_kv(m):
        v = m.group(0)
        if v in ('true', 'false', 'null'):
            return v
        if v.startswith('"'):
            return v
        if v.startswith("'"):
            v = v[1:-1]
            v = re.sub(r"\\\\|\\'|\"", lambda m: {
                '\\\\': '\\\\',
                "\\'": "'",
                '"': '\\"',
            }[m.group(0)], v)
            return '"%s"' % v
        return '"%s"' % v

    res = re.sub(r'''(?x)
        "(?:[^"\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nu]))*[^"\\]*"|
        '(?:[^'\\]*(?:\\\\|\\['"nu]))*[^'\\]*'|
        [a-zA-Z_][.a-zA-Z_0-9]*
        ''', fix_kv, code)
    res = re.sub(r',(\s*[\]}])', lambda m: m.group(1), res)
    return res
```

With this corrected function, the test case should pass without any assertion errors.
