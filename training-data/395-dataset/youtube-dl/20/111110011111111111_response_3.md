The error is occurring in the `get_element_by_attribute` function due to a logic bug. The function is named `get_elements_by_attribute` in the provided code, not `get_element_by_attribute`, so the test function name should be updated accordingly.

The potential error location is within the `get_elements_by_attribute` function, specifically in the regular expression used to parse the HTML content and extract the elements by attribute. The regular expression may not be correctly capturing the desired content.

The bug is occurring because the regular expression used in the function to match the HTML elements by attribute is not functioning as expected. This is resulting in incorrect matches and consequently incorrect return values.

To fix the bug, the regular expression in the `get_elements_by_attribute` function needs to be updated to accurately capture the HTML elements by attribute. Additionally, the function should return the correct content of the matched elements based on the attribute value.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_elements_by_attribute` function:

```python
import re

def get_elements_by_attribute(attribute, value, html, escape_value=True):
    """Return the content of the tag with the specified attribute in the passed HTML document"""

    value = re.escape(value) if escape_value else value

    retlist = []
    for m in re.finditer(r'<([a-zA-Z0-9:._-]+)(?:\s+[a-zA-Z0-9:._-]+(?:=[a-zA-Z0-9:._-]*|="[^"]*"|=\'[^\']*\'|""|\'\'))*\s+%s=["\']?%s["\']?(?:\s+[a-zA-Z0-9:._-]+(?:=[a-zA-Z0-9:._-]*|="[^"]*"|=\'[^\']*\'|""|\'\'))*\s*>(?P<content>.*?)</\1>' % (re.escape(attribute), value), html):
        res = m.group('content')

        if res.startswith('"') or res.startswith("'"):
            res = res[1:-1]

        retlist.append(res)

    return retlist
```

With this corrected code, the regular expression is modified to more accurately match the HTML elements by attribute, and the content extraction from the matched elements is also corrected.

After applying this corrected code, the test function should be updated to use the correct function name `get_elements_by_attribute` and then the test should pass without errors.
