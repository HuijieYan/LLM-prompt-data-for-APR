The bug in the given function is that the regular expression is not correctly matching the attribute and value in the HTML.

The regular expression used to match the attribute and value in the HTML is not correctly implemented. The function is trying to parse HTML using regular expressions, which is generally considered a bad practice due to the complexity of HTML.

To fix this bug, it's recommended to use a proper HTML parsing library like BeautifulSoup or lxml.

Here's the corrected code using BeautifulSoup:

```python
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

def get_elements_by_attribute(attribute, value, html, escape_value=True):
    """Return the content of the tag with the specified attribute in the passed HTML document"""

    soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')
    retlist = []
    
    tags = soup.find_all(attrs={attribute: value})
    for tag in tags:
        retlist.append(tag.string)
    
    return retlist
```

Using BeautifulSoup, the HTML document can be parsed and specific attributes can be targeted for extraction. This approach is more robust and easier to maintain compared to using regular expressions.
