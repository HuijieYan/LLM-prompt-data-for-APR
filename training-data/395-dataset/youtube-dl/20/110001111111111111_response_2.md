The error occurs because the `get_element_by_attribute` function does not return the expected values. The function is supposed to retrieve the content of the tag with the specified attribute in the passed HTML document, but it is not functioning as expected.

The potential error location within the function is the regular expression pattern used to match the HTML content. It seems that the pattern might not be correctly capturing the desired elements.

The bug occurs because the regular expression pattern used to match the HTML content is not capturing the correct elements. Additionally, the `unescapeHTML` function seems to be incomplete or missing, which may cause issues when trying to retrieve the content.

One approach to fixing the bug is to first ensure that the regular expression pattern accurately captures the desired HTML elements. Additionally, the `unescapeHTML` function should be completed or implemented in a way that correctly unescapes the HTML content.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_elements_by_attribute` function:

```python
import re
import html

def get_elements_by_attribute(attribute, value, html, escape_value=True):
    """Return the content of the tag with the specified attribute in the passed HTML document"""

    value = re.escape(value) if escape_value else value

    pattern = (
        r'<([a-zA-Z0-9:._-]+)'
        r'(?:\s+[a-zA-Z0-9:._-]+(?:=[a-zA-Z0-9:._-]*|="[^"]*"|=\'[^\']*\'))*?'
        r'\s+%s=[\'"]?%s[\'"]?'
        r'(?:\s+[a-zA-Z0-9:._-]+(?:=[a-zA-Z0-9:._-]*|="[^"]*"|=\'[^\']*\'))*?'
        r'\s*>'
        r'(?P<content>.*?)'
        r'</\1>'
    ) % (re.escape(attribute), value)

    retlist = []
    for m in re.finditer(pattern, html):
        res = m.group('content')

        res = html.unescape(res)
        retlist.append(res)

    return retlist
```

In this corrected code, the regular expression pattern has been adjusted to correctly match the desired HTML elements. Additionally, the `unescapeHTML` function has been replaced with Python's built-in `html.unescape` function to properly unescape the HTML content.
