The error in the "test_get_element_by_attribute" function occurs because the "get_element_by_attribute" function is returning "None" when it should return "foo."

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the "get_elements_by_attribute" function where it should return the content of the tag with the specified attribute, but it is not doing so correctly.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely due to an issue with the regular expression matching and extracting the content of the tag with the specified attribute.

To fix the bug, the regular expression used to match and extract the content of the tag with the specified attribute needs to be adjusted. Additionally, the logic for returning the extracted content should be validated to ensure it is working as expected.

The corrected code for the "get_elements_by_attribute" function is as follows:

```python
import re

def get_elements_by_attribute(attribute, value, html, escape_value=True):
    value = re.escape(value) if escape_value else value
    retlist = []
    for m in re.finditer(r'<([a-zA-Z0-9:._-]+)\b[^>]+\b%s=(["\'])?%s\2[^>]*>(.*?)</\1>' % (re.escape(attribute), value), html):
        res = m.group(3)
        retlist.append(unescapeHTML(res))
    return retlist
```

Now, the corrected "get_elements_by_attribute" function should work as expected and provide the appropriate content of the tag with the specified attribute, resolving the issue observed in the test cases.
