The buggy function `get_elements_by_attribute` is intended to return the content of the tag with the specified attribute in the passed HTML document. However, there are a few issues with the function:

1. The regular expression used to match the HTML tags and extract their content is complex and error-prone.
2. The usage of `unescapeHTML` in the function indicates that it is trying to unescape HTML entities without actually importing the `unescapeHTML` function from a module.

To fix the function, the regular expression for matching HTML tags and extracting content should be simplified and made more robust to handle different cases. Additionally, if the intention is to unescape HTML entities, the function should import the necessary method to perform the unescaping.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_elements_by_attribute` function:

```python
import re

# Corrected function
def get_elements_by_attribute(attribute, value, html, escape_value=True):
    """
    Return the content of the tag with the specified attribute in the passed HTML document
    """

    if escape_value:
        value = re.escape(value)

    retlist = []
    pattern = r'<(\w+)[^>]*\s{0}=["\']?{1}["\']?[^>]*>(.*?)</\1>'.format(attribute, value)
    for match in re.finditer(pattern, html):
        retlist.append(match.group(2))

    return retlist
```
