Potential error location: The regular expression used in re.finditer may not be capturing the correct content due to some issues with the pattern.

Reasons behind the bug: The regular expression pattern used in re.finditer is complex and may not be covering all possible cases for parsing HTML content.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Simplify the regular expression pattern to make it more robust and cover different scenarios.
2. Use a HTML parsing library such as BeautifulSoup to extract the content by attribute.

Corrected code:

```python
import re
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
import html

def get_elements_by_attribute(attribute, value, html, escape_value=True):
    """Return the content of the tag with the specified attribute in the passed HTML document"""

    soup = BeautifulSoup(html, 'html.parser')
    elements = soup.find_all(attrs={attribute: re.compile(value)})

    retlist = [html.unescape(str(element)) for element in elements]

    return retlist
```

In the corrected code, we have used BeautifulSoup to parse the HTML and find all elements with the specified attribute and value. We then unescape the HTML content before adding it to the retlist and returning it. This approach is more robust and reliable compared to the previous regular expression-based approach.
