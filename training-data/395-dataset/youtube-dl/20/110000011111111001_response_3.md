The buggy function `get_elements_by_attribute` is attempting to extract content from an HTML document based on the specified attribute and value. However, it currently has several issues.

1. The regex patterns used to match the HTML content are complex and may not be handling certain cases correctly.
2. The unescapeHTML function is being called, but it's not provided in the code, so this will cause an error.

To fix this, the regular expression and the unescapeHTML function need to be reviewed and corrected. Additionally, the way the attribute and value are handled within the regex pattern needs to be checked to ensure it works as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_elements_by_attribute` function:

```python
import re

def get_elements_by_attribute(attribute, value, html, escape_value=True):
    """Return the content of the tag with the specified attribute in the passed HTML document"""

    value = re.escape(value) if escape_value else value

    retlist = []
    for m in re.finditer(r'<([a-zA-Z0-9:._-]+)(?:\s+[a-zA-Z0-9:._-]+=(?:[a-zA-Z0-9:._-]*|"[^"]*"|\'[^\']*\'))*\s+%s=["\']?%s["\']?(?:\s+[a-zA-Z0-9:._-]+=(?:[a-zA-Z0-9:._-]*|"[^"]*"|\'[^\']*\'))*\s*>(?P<content>.*?)</\1>' % (attribute, value), html):
        res = m.group('content')
        retlist.append(res)

    return retlist
```

This corrected code simplifies the regular expression pattern to match the HTML content based on the specified attribute and value. The unescapeHTML function has been removed as it was not provided in the buggy code.
