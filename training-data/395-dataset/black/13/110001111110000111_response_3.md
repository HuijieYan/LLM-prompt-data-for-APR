The error message indicates that there is an issue with parsing the source code. The specific line causing the problem is the `return (i * 2 async for i in arange(42))` line in the source code.

The problematic function is the `generate_tokens` function provided in the buggy function source code. The issue seems to be related to parsing asynchronous comprehensions in the source code, as indicated by the use of `async for` in the `return` statement. The syntax for asynchronous comprehensions was introduced in Python 3.6, but the function is not handling it properly.

The following are possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the `generate_tokens` function to handle the parsing of asynchronous comprehensions properly.
2. Ensure that the function supports the syntax introduced in Python 3.6 and later, including asynchronous comprehensions.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_tokens` function:

```python
def generate_tokens(readline):
    # ... (same initial code)

    while 1:  # loop over lines in stream
        try:
            line = readline()
        except StopIteration:
            line = ''
        # existing code continues...

        while pos < max:
            pseudomatch = pseudoprog.match(line, pos)
            if pseudomatch:  # scan for tokens
                start, end = pseudomatch.span(1)
                # existing code continues...

                # Update handling for async and await keywords and asynchronous comprehensions
                if token in ('async', 'await'):
                    yield (ASYNC if token == 'async' else AWAIT, token, spos, epos, line)
                    continue

                if initial == '(':  # handle '(' for asynchronous comprehensions
                    async_comprehension_open_paren = True
                    yield (OP, token, spos, epos, line)
                elif async_comprehension_open_paren and initial == 'for':
                    yield (ASYNC, token, spos, epos, line)
                    async_comprehension_open_paren = False
                # existing code continues...

        # existing code continues...
```

In this corrected code, the handling for asynchronous comprehensions is updated to properly parse the source code with asynchronous constructs. Now, the `ASYNC` token is properly yielded for the `async for` pattern and other relevant tokens are handled accordingly. This should resolve the issue related to parsing asynchronous comprehensions in the source code.
