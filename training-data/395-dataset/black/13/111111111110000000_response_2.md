```python
def generate_tokens(readline):
    '''
    This generator requires one argument, readline, which must be a 
    callable object providing the same interface as the readline() 
    method of built-in file objects. Each call to the function should 
    return one line of input as a string.  Alternately, readline can 
    be a callable function terminating with StopIteration: 
    readline = open(myfile).next # Example of alternate readline.
    '''
    #code
    pass
