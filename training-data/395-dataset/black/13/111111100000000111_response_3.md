The potential error location in the problematic function is the portion of the code that handles async/await parsing. The bug seems to be related to the handling of async/await statements.

The bug is likely occurring because the current implementation of the `generate_tokens` function does not correctly handle async/await statements and might be missing some necessary logic.

To fix the bug, the code for async/await parsing needs to be reviewed and potentially rewritten to ensure that async/await statements are correctly handled and tokenized.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_tokens` function:

```python
def generate_tokens(readline):
    # ... (previous implementation code)

    # Handlers for async/await parsing
    async_tokens = []

    while 1:
        # ... (previous implementation code)

        if token in ('async', 'await'):
            token_type = ASYNC if token == 'async' else AWAIT
            async_tokens.append((token_type, token, spos, epos, line))
            continue

        # ... (previous implementation code)

    if async_tokens:
        for async_token in async_tokens:
            yield async_token

    # ... (previous implementation code)
```

This corrected code includes a new `async_tokens` list that is used to store async/await tokens encountered during the tokenization process. After processing all tokens, the function yields the async_tokens. This revised logic ensures that async/await statements are correctly handled and tokenized.
