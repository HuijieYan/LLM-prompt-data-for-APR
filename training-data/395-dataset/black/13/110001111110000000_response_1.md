def generate_tokens(readline):
    """
    The generate_tokens() generator requires one argument, readline, which
    must be a callable object which provides the same interface as the
    readline() method of built-in file objects. Each call to the function
    should return one line of input as a string.  Alternately, readline
    can be a callable function terminating with StopIteration:
        readline = open(myfile).next    # Example of alternate readline

    The generator produces 5-tuples with these members: the token type; the
    token string; a 2-tuple (srow, scol) of ints specifying the row and
    column where the token begins in the source; a 2-tuple (erow, ecol) of
    ints specifying the row and column where the token ends in the source;
    and the line on which the token was found. The line passed is the
    logical line; continuation lines are included.
