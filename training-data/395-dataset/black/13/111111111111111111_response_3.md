The error message indicates that the function `lib2to3_parse()` in the file `black.py` is failing to parse the source text provided. The source text causing the issue is `return (i*2 async for i in arange(42))` and is failing with the message "Cannot parse: 4:16: return (i*2 async for i in arange(42)". This suggests that the tokenizer `generate_tokens()` in the file `tokenize.py` is not handling the `async` keyword properly.

The potential error location lies in the part of the code that deals with the `async` and `await` tokens. It seems like the tokenizer may not be properly differentiating between these keywords and regular identifiers.

The bug occurs because the tokenizer does not correctly handle the `async` and `await` tokens, leading to parsing errors when they are encountered in the source text.

To fix the bug, the tokenizer `generate_tokens()` needs to be modified to correctly handle the `async` and `await` tokens as per the Python syntax.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_tokens()` function:

```python
def generate_tokens(readline):
    # ... (existing code)

    while 1:  # loop over lines in stream
        # ... (existing code)

        while pos < max:
            pseudomatch = pseudoprog.match(line, pos)
            if pseudomatch:  # scan for tokens
                start, end = pseudomatch.span(1)
                spos, epos, pos = (lnum, start), (lnum, end), end
                token, initial = line[start:end], line[start]

                # Check for async and await tokens and handle them as per the Python syntax
                if token in ('async', 'await'):
                    yield (ASYNC if token == 'async' else AWAIT, token, spos, epos, line)
                    continue

                # ... (rest of the token handling code)
            else:
                yield (ERRORTOKEN, line[pos], (lnum, pos), (lnum, pos+1), line)
                pos = pos + 1

    # (remaining code as it is)
```

In the corrected code, when the tokenizer encounters the `async` and `await` tokens, it correctly yields the corresponding tokens (ASYNC or AWAIT) along with their positions in the source text.

This approach fixes the bug by handling the `async` and `await` tokens properly in the tokenizer, allowing the parser to parse the source text without encountering errors.
