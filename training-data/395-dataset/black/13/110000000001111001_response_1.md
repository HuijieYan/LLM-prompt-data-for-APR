The potential error in the given code is that the function generate_tokens() is producing a StopIteration error due to the incorrect handling of the readline parameter.

The reason behind the bug is that the function is not handling the StopIteration raised by readline() correctly, which causes the loop to terminate unexpectedly.

To fix this bug, the function should handle the StopIteration exception raised by readline() properly by breaking out of the loop when the exception is caught.

Here's the corrected code for the generate_tokens() function:

```python
def generate_tokens(readline):
    """
    The generate_tokens() generator requires one argument, readline, which
    must be a callable object which provides the same interface as the
    readline() method of built-in file objects. Each call to the function
    should return one line of input as a string.  Alternately, readline
    can be a callable function terminating with StopIteration:
        readline = open(myfile).next    # Example of alternate readline

    The generator produces 5-tuples with these members: the token type; the
    token string; a 2-tuple (srow, scol) of ints specifying the row and
    column where the token begins in the source; a 2-tuple (erow, ecol) of
    ints specifying the row and column where the token ends in the source;
    and the line on which the token was found. The line passed is the
    logical line; continuation lines are included.
    """
    lnum = parenlev = continued = 0
    numchars = '0123456789'
    contstr, needcont = '', 0
    contline = None
    indents = [0]

    # 'stashed' and 'async_*' are used for async/await parsing
    stashed = None
    async_def = False
    async_def_indent = 0
    async_def_nl = False

    while True:
        try:
            line = readline()
        except StopIteration:
            break
        lnum = lnum + 1
        pos, max = 0, len(line)
        # rest of the code...
```

In the corrected code, the while loop has been simplified to a condition-based loop using `while True`, and the try-except block now properly handles the StopIteration exception, breaking out of the loop when the exception is raised.
