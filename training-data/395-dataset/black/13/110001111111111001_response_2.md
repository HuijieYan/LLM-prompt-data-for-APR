The error message is being raised at line 417 of the test function `test_python37`. The error seems to be related to parsing a string with lib2to3. The test function is using the `fs` function to parse a source text and compare it with the expected output. This function must be calling the `lib2to3_parse` function which uses the buggy `generate_tokens` function.

The potential error location is in the `generate_tokens` function, specifically in the logic for handling the async/await parsing. It seems the implementation for async/await is causing the parsing error.

The bug is occurring because the implementation of async/await parsing logic is not handling the indentation and line continuation properly.

To fix the issue, we need to modify the logic for async/await parsing and ensure that the indentation and line continuation are taken into account correctly.

The corrected code for the `generate_tokens` function:

```python
def generate_tokens(readline):
    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged, only the async/await parsing logic will be updated)
    
    # 'stashed' and 'async_*' are used for async/await parsing
    stashed = None
    async_def = False
    async_def_indent = 0
    async_def_nl = False
    async_for = False  # new flag for async for loop

    while 1:  # loop over lines in stream
        # ... (other parts of the code remains unchanged)
        
        if token == 'async':
            if async_def:
                yield (ASYNC, token, spos, epos, line)
                continue

            stashed = (NAME, token, spos, epos, line)
            async_def = True
            async_def_indent = indents[-1]
        elif token == 'await':
            if async_for:
                yield (AWAIT, token, spos, epos, line)
            else:
                if stashed:
                    yield stashed
                    stashed = None
                yield (AWAIT, token, spos, epos, line)
        
        # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
```
In the corrected code, we introduced a new flag `async_for` to handle the async for loop case separately. We also modified the logic for async/await handling to ensure the correct tokens are yielded based on context.

This should address the parsing issue related to async/await logic.
