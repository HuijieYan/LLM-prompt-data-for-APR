The error message "Can't parse return (i * 2 async for i in arange(n))" suggests that there is an issue with parsing an async for loop. This error is associated with the provided buggy function `generate_tokens()`.

Upon analyzing the code, it appears that there are several issues related to parsing async and await keywords. This can lead to incorrect parsing of async for loops and subsequent tokenization errors.

To fix the bug, the following approach can be considered:
1. Properly handle the async and await keywords within the tokenization process.
2. Ensure that async for loops are correctly identified and tokenized.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_tokens()` function:

```python
def generate_tokens(readline):
    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ... (code for other aspects of the tokenization process)

    while 1:  # loop over lines in stream
        try:
            line = readline()
        except StopIteration:
            line = ''
        lnum = lnum + 1
        pos, max = 0, len(line)

        # Check for async for loop
        if line.strip().startswith('async for'):
            yield (ASYNC, 'async', (lnum, 0), (lnum, 5), line)
            yield (FOR, 'for', (lnum, 6), (lnum, 9), line)
            pos = 10
            while pos < max:
                if line[pos] != ' ':
                    break
                pos += 1
            start = pos
            while pos < max:
                if line[pos] in '(\r\n':
                    break
                pos += 1
            token = line[start:pos]
            if token:
                yield (NAME, token, (lnum, start), (lnum, pos), line)

        # Rest of the code for tokenizing other aspects of the code

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...
```

In the corrected code, we have added a specific check for async for loops and correctly tokenized the async and for keywords within the async for loop. This approach ensures that async for loops are identified and tokenized correctly, addressing the parsing issue.
