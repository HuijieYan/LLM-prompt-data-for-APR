Certainly! Here's the full corrected code of the `generate_tokens` function:

```python
import re

def generate_tokens(readline):
    lnum = parenlev = continued = 0
    tabsize = 8
    async_def = False
    async_def_indent = 0
    async_def_nl = False
    endprogs = {}  # An assumption made about the presence of endprogs dict

    while True:
        try:
            line = readline()
        except StopIteration:
            line = ''
        lnum += 1
        pos, max = 0, len(line)

        if parenlev == 0 and not continued:  # new statement
            if not line:
                break
            column = 0
            while pos < max:  # measure leading whitespace
                if line[pos] == ' ':
                    column += 1
                elif line[pos] == '\t':
                    column = (column // tabsize + 1) * tabsize
                elif line[pos] == '\f':
                    column = 0
                else:
                    break
                pos += 1
            if pos == max:
                break

            elif initial.isidentifier():      # ordinary name
                if token in ('async', 'await'):
                    if async_def:
                        yield (ASYNC if token == 'async' else AWAIT,
                               token, spos, epos, line)
                        continue
                # Handling 'async for' expression
                if token == 'async' and line[pos:pos+3] == 'for ':
                    async_def = True
                    async_def_indent = indents[-1]
                    yield (ASYNC, token, spos, epos, line)
                    continue
                # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)
                    
        # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)

    if stashed:
        yield stashed
        stashed = None

    for indent in indents[1:]:  # pop remaining indent levels
        yield (DEDENT, '', (lnum, 0), (lnum, 0), '')
    yield (ENDMARKER, '', (lnum, 0), (lnum, 0), '')
```

In this corrected version, the handling of the `async for` expression has been added to the function. This modification should address the parsing issue mentioned in the error message.
