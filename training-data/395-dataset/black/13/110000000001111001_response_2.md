The potential error in the given function is with the 'try-except' block for handling the StopIteration exception. This block is intended to catch the StopIteration exception when readline reaches the end, but the handling of this exception is leading to incorrect behavior.

The bug occurs because the 'try-except' block for handling StopIteration is catching the exception thrown by the readline function and then setting line to an empty string. This causes the loop to continue indefinitely as it never actually exits when reaching the end of the input.

To fix this, we need to modify the handling of the StopIteration exception and add a condition to break the loop when the end of input is reached.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def generate_tokens(readline):
    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

    while True:  # loop over lines in stream
        try:
            line = readline()
        except StopIteration:
            break  # Break the loop when the end of input is reached
        lnum = lnum + 1
        # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```
