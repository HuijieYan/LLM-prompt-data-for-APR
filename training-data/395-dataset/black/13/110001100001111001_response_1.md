Potential error location: The issue may lie in the `contstr` variable, which appears to be used to handle continued strings. There are conditions for continued strings, but the handling seems to be causing errors.

Reason for the bug: The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of continued strings, which has led to unexpected behavior and errors in the function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Review the logic for handling continued strings and ensure that it correctly identifies and processes them.
2. Check conditions for continued strings and make sure they align with Python's syntax rules for multi-line string literals.
3. Use Python's built-in methods for handling multi-line strings if available, to avoid potential errors in custom logic.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def generate_tokens(readline):
    # (existing code here...)

    # 'stashed' and 'async_*' are used for async/await parsing
    stashed = None
    async_def = False
    async_def_indent = 0
    async_def_nl = False

    while 1:  # loop over lines in stream
        try:
            line = readline()
        except StopIteration:
            line = ''
        lnum = lnum + 1
        pos, max = 0, len(line)

        if contstr:  # continued string
            # (existing code here...)
            continue

        elif parenlev == 0 and not continued:  # new statement
            # (existing code here...)
            continue

        else:  # continued statement
            # (existing code here...)
            continue

        while pos < max:
            if contstr:  # continued string (update condition)
                # (existing code here...)
                continue
            else:  # other token processing
                # (existing code here...)
                continue

    # (existing code here...)
```
