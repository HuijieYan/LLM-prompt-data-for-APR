The error in the provided code is due to the `format_file_in_place` function having issues in modifying the file contents and then comparing the expected and actual differences in the test case. The error occurs at the comparison step when the expected diff is not equal to the actual diff.

The potential error location is within the `format_file_in_place` function, specifically in how the file contents are being handled and modified.

The bug occurred because the file contents are not being handled properly when trying to modify the content in place. This leads to an incorrect comparison between the expected and actual differences.

To fix the bug, the `format_file_in_place` function should properly handle the file contents and ensure that file modifications are done accurately. Additionally, the comparison logic for the expected and actual differences needs to be reviewed to ensure it accurately reflects the changes made.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_file_in_place` function:

```python
from pathlib import Path
import tokenize
import sys
from io import StringIO
import os

class WriteBack:
    NO = 0
    YES = 1
    DIFF = 2

class FileContent:
    pass

class NothingChanged(Exception):
    pass

# corrected format_file_in_place function
def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: any = None,  # multiprocessing.Manager().Lock() is some crazy proxy
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """
    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:
        src_name = f"{src.name}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src.name}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
