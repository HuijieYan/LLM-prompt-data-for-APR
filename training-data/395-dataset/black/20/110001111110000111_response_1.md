The error occurs in the `format_file_in_place` function due to incorrect handling of file paths. When the function `diff` is called, it tries to display the path in the diff output, but it fails to do so, causing the assertion error in the test case.

The `format_file_in_place` function should handle the file paths properly and pass the correct paths to the `diff` function.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `format_file_in_place` function to use the correct file paths when calling other functions.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_file_in_place` function:

```python
import sys
import os
from io import StringIO
from pathlib import Path
import black

def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: black.WriteBack = black.WriteBack.NO,
    lock: any = None,
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == black.WriteBack.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == black.WriteBack.DIFF:
        src_name = f"{src}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(
            src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name
        )
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```

In the corrected code, we use the `src` path directly when creating `src_name` and `dst_name` for the diff output. This will ensure that the full file path is displayed correctly in the diff output.
