The error occurs within the `format_file_in_place` function. The error message from the test case indicates that the expected and actual differences in the file format are not matching. This suggests that the `format_file_in_place` function is not performing the formatting correctly.

The potential error location is likely within the logic that handles writing back the formatted contents. This could be due to incorrect conditional checks or issues with the file writing process.

The bug occurs because the logic for writing back the formatted file is not handling the different write back options correctly, leading to unexpected differences in the formatted output.

To fix the bug, the conditional checks for `write_back` should be reviewed and potentially rewritten to ensure that the correct action (writing to file or producing a diff) is taken based on the specified option.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_file_in_place` function:

```python
def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None,  # multiprocessing.Manager().Lock() is some crazy proxy
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False
    
    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:
        src_name = f"{src.name}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src.name}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```

In the corrected code, the conditional checks for `write_back` have been updated to use the `WriteBack` enum directly for comparison. Additionally, the file writing process has been fixed to ensure that the formatted content is written back correctly when the `write_back` option is set to `YES`.
