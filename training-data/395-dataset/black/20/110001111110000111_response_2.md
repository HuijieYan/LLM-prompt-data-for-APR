The error occurs in the `test_expression_diff` function within the `test_black` module. The error message indicates that the expected and actual diff outputs do not match. The mismatch occurs because the diff output includes incorrect file names, and this results in the assertion error.

The potential error location is within the `format_file_in_place` function, specifically in the `if write_back == write_back.DIFF` block where the file names are being manipulated.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `format_file_in_place` function does not correctly handle the file names when generating the diff output. As a result, the test case is unable to match the expected and actual diff outputs.

One approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the file names are correctly formatted in the `format_file_in_place` function to match the expected output format. This may involve correcting the filename manipulation logic inside the `if write_back == write_back.DIFF` block.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_file_in_place` function:

```python
def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None,  # multiprocessing.Manager().Lock() is some crazy proxy
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:
        src_name = f"{src.name}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src.name}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```

In the corrected code, the filenames `src_name` and `dst_name` are formatted correctly to match the expected format for the diff output. This should resolve the issue with the mismatched diff outputs in the test case.
