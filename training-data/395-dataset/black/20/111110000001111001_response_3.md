The bug in the function is related to the `write_back` parameter. The function uses an Enum `WriteBack` to represent different options, but the comparison with `write_back.YES` and `write_back.DIFF` is incorrect. 

The function compares `write_back` with the values `write_back.YES` and `write_back.DIFF`, but these values are actually members of the Enum class `WriteBack`. Instead of comparing with these values, we should compare the `write_back` parameter directly with the Enum members.

To fix the bug, we should compare `write_back` with `WriteBack.YES` and `WriteBack.DIFF` directly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from enum import Enum
from pathlib import Path

class WriteBack(Enum):
    YES = 1
    DIFF = 2
    NO = 3

def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None,  
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:  
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:
        src_name = f"{src.name}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src.name}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```
