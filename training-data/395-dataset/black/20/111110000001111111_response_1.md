The bug seems to be related to the handling of file paths in the `format_file_in_place` function. The function is not correctly handling the file paths when generating the diff output and when writing back the formatted code.

The bug occurs because the `src.name` attribute is used without explicitly converting it to a string in the form of `str(src.name)`. This results in incorrect formatting of the file paths when generating the diff output and when writing back the formatted code.

To fix the bug, the `src.name` attribute should be converted to a string explicitly to ensure that the full file path is used in the diff output and when writing back the formatted code.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_file_in_place` function:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Any
from enum import Enum

class WriteBack(Enum):
    NO = 0
    YES = 1
    DIFF = 2

def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:
        src_name = f"{str(src)}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{str(src)}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```

In the corrected code, the `src.name` attribute is replaced with `str(src)` to ensure that the full file path is used when generating the diff output and when writing back the formatted code. This should resolve the issue where the diff doesn't display the full file path.
