The potential error in the provided code is that the function `format_file_in_place` is not properly indented within the Python code. It seems that the function is nested within another function or block of code, but it should be a standalone function.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function `format_file_in_place` is not defined properly within the code. It should be properly organized and placed at the same indentation level as other functions.

To fix this bug, the `format_file_in_place` function should be properly indented and placed at the same level as the other functions in the file. Additionally, make sure that the function's input arguments (`src`, `line_length`, `fast`, etc.) are properly handled within the function's body.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_file_in_place` function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/black_20/black.py

from pathlib import Path
from typing import Any
import sys
import tokenize
from difflib import unified_diff

# relative function's signature in this file
def format_file_contents(src_contents: str, line_length: int, fast: bool) -> str:
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def diff(a: str, b: str, a_name: str, b_name: str) -> str:
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None,  # multiprocessing.Manager().Lock() is some crazy proxy
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:
        src_name = f"{src.name}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src.name}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```

In the corrected code, the `format_file_in_place` function is properly defined with the correct indentation level. Additionally, the `WriteBack` enum is used correctly, and the function's input arguments are used within the function's body.
