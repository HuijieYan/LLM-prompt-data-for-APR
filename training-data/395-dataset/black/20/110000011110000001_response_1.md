The error seems to be occurring when comparing the expected and actual outputs within the `test_expression_diff` test function. The error message indicates that there is a mismatch between the expected output from the black formatting and the actual output.

Upon analyzing the provided function `format_file_in_place`, it seems that the issue might be related to the way the file is being written back in `write_back.YES` and `write_back.DIFF` cases.

The potential error lies in the condition for writing back the formatted file: 

```python
if write_back == write_back.YES:
    with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
        f.write(dst_contents)
```
and
```python
elif write_back == write_back.DIFF:
    ...
```

The reason for the bug might be the conditional check for `write_back` where the variable types are being compared, but instead the values they represent should be compared.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to change the condition checks to compare the values instead of the types of `write_back`. 

Here is the corrected code for the `format_file_in_place` function:

```python
def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None,
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """
    
    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:  # Compare the value instead of type
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:  # Compare the value instead of type
        src_name = f"{src.name}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src.name}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```

By comparing the values of `write_back` instead of their types, the corrected function should address the bug and ensure that the file is written back correctly.
