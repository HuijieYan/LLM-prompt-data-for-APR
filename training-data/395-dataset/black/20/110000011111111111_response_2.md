The error occurs in the function `format_file_in_place` where the `src_name` and `dst_name` variables are not being correctly constructed with the full path to the files. This causes the discrepancy in the expected and actual output in the test function.

The reason behind the bug is that the `src_name` and `dst_name` variables are being constructed without including the full path of the files. This results in the mismatch between the expected and actual diff output.

To fix the bug, the full path of the file should be included in the `src_name` and `dst_name` variables. This can be achieved by using the `src.absolute()` method to get the absolute path of the source file.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_file_in_place` function:

```python
def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None,  # multiprocessing.Manager().Lock() is some crazy proxy
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == write_back.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == write_back.DIFF:
        src_name = f"{src.absolute()}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src.absolute()}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```

With this correction, the `src_name` and `dst_name` will include the full path of the source file, ensuring that the expected and actual diff output will match.
