The error is likely occurring in the function `test_expression_diff` within the file `test_black.py`. This error is an `AssertionError` which occurs when the expected diff does not match the actual output.

The bug is likely in the `format_file_in_place` function. This is because the error message mentions that the expected diff isn't equal to the actual and suggests overwriting the test file with a new file. This indicates that the `format_file_in_place` function is not producing the expected diff.

The potential reason behind this bug is that the `format_file_in_place` function is not performing the formatting correctly, resulting in a different output compared to the expected diff.

To resolve the bug, we need to correct the `format_file_in_place` function to ensure that it formats the file contents correctly and produces the expected diff.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_file_in_place` function:

```python
from pathlib import Path
import tokenize
import sys
from black import format_file_contents, diff, WriteBack

def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None,  # multiprocessing.Manager().Lock() is some crazy proxy
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:
        src_name = f"{src.name}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src.name}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```

In this corrected code, the function signature and the logic for formatting the file contents and producing the diff have been improved. The correct `WriteBack` enum from the `black` module is used, and the file writing and diff generation logic has been adjusted to align with the expected behavior.
