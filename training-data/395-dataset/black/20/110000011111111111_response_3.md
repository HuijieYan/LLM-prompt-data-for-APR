The potential error location is in the `write_back` parameter comparison. 

The bug occurred because the `write_back` parameter is compared with `write_back.YES` and `write_back.DIFF` using the wrong syntax. Instead of `write_back.YES` and `write_back.DIFF`, the comparison should be against `WriteBack.YES` and `WriteBack.DIFF` (i.e., the enum type, not the variable).

To fix the bug, the comparison should be updated to use the enum type `WriteBack.YES` and `WriteBack.DIFF` in the if-elif condition. Additionally, the usage of `src.name` should be updated before constructing `src_name` and `dst_name`.

Here is the corrected code for the `format_file_in_place` function:

```python
from pathlib import Path
import sys
from typing import Any
from io import StringIO

class WriteBack:
    NO = 0
    YES = 1
    DIFF = 2

def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None  # multiprocessing.Manager().Lock() is some crazy proxy
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is WriteBack.YES, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """
    with open(src, "r", encoding='utf-8') as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:
        src_name = f"{src.name}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src.name}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```

By making these changes, the bug in the `format_file_in_place` function should be fixed.
