Potential error location:
The issue seems to be related to the output of the `--diff` option not displaying the full file path. This is likely occurring in the `format_file_in_place` function, specifically in the section where the diff is being generated and displayed.

Reason for the bug:
The bug is likely occurring because the variable `src.name` is being used to construct the file names for the diff display. This may not include the full path to the file, which results in the incomplete file path being displayed in the diff output.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the full file path should be used when constructing the file names for the diff output. This will ensure that the complete path of the file is displayed in the diff, making it easier to read and consistent with other diff-producing programs.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected function
def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None,  # multiprocessing.Manager().Lock() is some crazy proxy
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == write_back.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == write_back.DIFF:
        src_name = f"{src.resolve()}  (original)"  # Use resolve() to get the full file path
        dst_name = f"{src.resolve()}  (formatted)"  # Use resolve() to get the full file path
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```
In the corrected code, the `resolve()` method is used to get the full file path when constructing the file names for the diff output. This ensures that the complete path of the file is displayed in the diff, addressing the issue with incomplete file paths in the `--diff` output.
