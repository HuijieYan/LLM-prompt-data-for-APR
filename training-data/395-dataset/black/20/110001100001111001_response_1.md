Potential error location: The error is likely located in the condition checking for write_back value. The current implementation is using a mix of the enumeration class and its attributes to compare and choose the block for writing back.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the comparison of write_back is not handled correctly within the conditional statements.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Compare the write_back variable with WriteBack.YES and WriteBack.DIFF directly, rather than comparing with write_back.YES and write_back.DIFF attributes.
2. Use the Enum class directly instead of using specific attribute values.

Corrected code:

```python
def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None,
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.
    
    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """
    
    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False
    
    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:  # compare with Enum value directly
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:  # compare with Enum value directly
        src_name = f"{src.name}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src.name}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```
