Potential error location: 
The potential error location is in the if condition when checking for `write_back` value. The comparison `write_back == write_back.YES` and `write_back == write_back.DIFF` should be compared to the actual values instead of the enum class `WriteBack`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug is caused by comparing the enum class `WriteBack` directly instead of comparing to its actual values. This causes the if condition to always evaluate to False and the code inside those blocks is never executed.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Compare the `write_back` parameter to its actual values (e.g., `write_back == WriteBack.YES` instead of `write_back == write_back.YES`).
2. Update the import statement to ensure `WriteBack` is correctly referenced.

Corrected code:

```python
from enum import Enum
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Any

class WriteBack(Enum):
    NO = 0
    YES = 1
    DIFF = 2

def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None,
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:
        src_name = f"{src.name}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src.name}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```
