The error occurs within the `format_file_in_place` function. The function is not using the `src` parameter to obtain the file name in the differential output, resulting in a mismatch with the expected value. This leads to the assertion error in the test function.

The `format_file_in_place` function retrieves the file name from the `src` parameter using the `src_name` variable. However, the file name is obtained incorrectly and doesn't match the expected output.

To fix this bug, the function needs to use the `src` parameter to obtain the file name for the differential output. This can be achieved by replacing the current incorrect implementation with the corrected code as shown below:

```python
from typing import Any, Path
import sys
import tokenize
from difflib import unified_diff

def format_file_contents(src_contents: str, line_length: int, fast: bool) -> str:
    # ... omitted code ...
    return src_contents

def diff(a: str, b: str, a_name: str, b_name: str) -> str:
    return ''.join(unified_diff(a.splitlines(1), b.splitlines(1), a_name, b_name))

def format_file_in_place(
        src: Path,
        line_length: int,
        fast: bool,
        write_back: Any,
        lock: Any
) -> bool:
    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast)
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == 'YES':
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == 'DIFF':
        with open(src, "r", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            original_contents = f.read()
            diff_contents = diff(original_contents, dst_contents, src.name + " (original)", src.name + " (formatted)")
            if lock:
                lock.acquire()
            try:
                sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
            finally:
                if lock:
                    lock.release()
    return True
```

In this corrected implementation, we have used the `src.name` attribute to obtain the correct file name for the differential output. This should resolve the issue and produce the expected output for the test case.
