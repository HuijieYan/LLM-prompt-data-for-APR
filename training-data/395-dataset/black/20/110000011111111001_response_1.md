The error in the `format_file_in_place` function seems to stem from the diff generation when `write_back` is set to `WriteBack.DIFF`. The error message indicates that the expected diff differs from the actual diff, even though the reformatted code appears to be the same in both cases.

One potential reason for this issue is the fact that the source file path is being used in the diff generation. This may cause discrepancies when comparing expected and actual results, especially in a testing environment where the file paths could change.

To fix this issue, it might be better to compare the contents of the source and destination files directly when `write_back` is set to `WriteBack.DIFF`. This would ensure that the comparison accurately reflects the changes made during formatting.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_file_in_place` function:

```python
def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None,
) -> bool:
    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```

In the corrected code, the diff generation now compares the `src_contents` (original file contents) with the `dst_contents` (reformatted file contents) directly. This change should prevent issues related to file path comparisons and accurately reflect the changes made during formatting.
