The function expects the `write_back` parameter to be an instance of the `WriteBack` enum, but it incorrectly compares it to `write_back.YES` and `write_back.DIFF` instead of `WriteBack.YES` and `WriteBack.DIFF`. Additionally, the `tokenize` library and `NothingChanged` exception are not imported or defined in the provided code, so they need to be added.

To fix the bug:
1. Import the `WriteBack` enum, `tokenize` library, and `NothingChanged` exception.
2. Modify the comparisons of `write_back` to compare with `WriteBack.YES` and `WriteBack.DIFF`.
3. Replace the variable `src` with `src.name` in the construction of `src_name` and `dst_name` to get the file names for printing in case of a diff.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
from enum import Enum
from pathlib import Path
import tokenize
import sys


class WriteBack (Enum):
    NO = 0
    YES = 1
    DIFF = 2


class NothingChanged(Exception):
    pass


def format_file_contents(src_contents, line_length, fast):
    # implementation of format_file_contents
    return src_contents


def diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name):
    # implementation of diff
    return "diff"  # Replace with actual diff


def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None,  # multiprocessing.Manager().Lock() is some crazy proxy
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """
    
    src = Path(src)  # Convert src to type Path
    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:
        src_name = f"{src.name}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src.name}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
