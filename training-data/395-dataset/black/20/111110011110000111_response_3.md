1. The test case is attempting to compare the expected and actual diff outputs while using the `format_file_in_place` function. The error message indicates that the expected and actual diff outputs are not matching, causing the test to fail.

2. The potential error location within the `format_file_in_place` function is the conditional check for `write_back` in the if-elif-else block.

3. The bug is likely occurring because the comparison of `write_back` with `write_back.YES` and `write_back.DIFF` is not working as expected. Additionally, the diff output is not displaying the full file path, which causes a mismatch between expected and actual outputs during the test.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the conditional check for `write_back` to ensure proper comparison with the `WriteBack` enum values.
   - Ensure that the diff output includes the full file path for proper comparison in the test case.

5. Corrected code for the `format_file_in_place` function:

```python
from enum import Enum

class WriteBack(Enum):
    NO = 0
    YES = 1
    DIFF = 2

def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None,
) -> bool:
    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast)
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:
        src_name = f"{src}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```

This corrected code includes modification of the conditional check for `write_back` using the `WriteBack` enum values and ensures that the full file path is included in the diff output for proper comparison.
