The error occurs in the `test_expression_diff` function which is a test case for the `format_file_in_place` function. The test case compares the expected diff with the actual diff obtained from running the `format_file_in_place` function and fails due to a mismatch.

The error is likely occurring within the `format_file_in_place` function when it is formatting the file contents and generating the diff. The issue seems to be related to the formatting of file paths when generating the diff.

It is possible that the function is not properly handling the file paths when generating the diff, leading to incorrect file path representation in the diff output.

To fix the bug, the `format_file_in_place` function needs to ensure that the file paths are represented correctly when generating the diff. This may involve modifying the way file paths are passed and processed within the function to ensure that the correct file paths are used when generating the diff output.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_file_in_place` function:

```python
from pathlib import Path
import sys
import os
from io import StringIO
from black import dump_to_file, WriteBack, diff, format_file_contents

def format_file_in_place(
    src: str,  # assuming src is a string representing the file path
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None,  # multiprocessing.Manager().Lock() is some crazy proxy
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with open(src, 'r') as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:
        with open(src, "w") as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:
        src_name = f"{src}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```

In the corrected code, the `format_file_in_place` function takes the file path as a string and performs operations based on that. It also properly constructs the source file name and the formatted file name for generating the diff. This should ensure that the file paths are represented correctly in the diff output.
