The error message indicates that there is a mismatch between the expected and actual output of the `test_expression_diff` test. The expected and actual outputs should match but they are different due to the presence of specific strings, file paths and format differences in the expected and actual output.

The issue could be occurring due to the mismatch between the filenames that are used to generate the diff. The incorrect filenames being used in the actual output seem to be causing the test failure.

To resolve this issue, we need to correct the filenames that are used in the actual output to match the expected filenames. We also need to ensure that the content in the expected and actual outputs are formatted consistently.

Here is the corrected and refactored code for the problematic function:

```python
from pathlib import Path
import tokenize
import sys
import os

class WriteBack:
    YES = 1
    NO = 0
    DIFF = 2

def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: any = None,
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """
    src_name = src.name
    src_buffer = open(src, "r", encoding="utf-8")
    src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        src_buffer.close()
        return False

    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:
        dst_name = f"{src.name}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    src_buffer.close()
    return True
```

The changes made in the corrected code:
1. Removed the unnecessary use of `tokenize.open` and replaced it with `open` to read the file contents.
2. Moved the retrieval of `src_name` up in the function to ensure consistency.
3. Changed references to `write_back` and `lock` to use the class attributes directly.
4. Closed the file buffer after it's usage.
5. Overall refactored and corrected the code structure for better readability and maintainability.
