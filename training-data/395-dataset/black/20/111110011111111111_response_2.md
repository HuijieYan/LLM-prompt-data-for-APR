The error is occurring in the `test_expression_diff` test case, where the expected diff output doesn't match the actual diff output. The mismatch is causing an `AssertionError`.

The potential error location is within the `format_file_in_place` function, particularly in the generation of the `diff_contents`.

The reason behind the bug is that the function `format_file_in_place` is not correctly generating the diff output using the provided input and file content.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the diff generation process within the `format_file_in_place` function is correct and accurate. This may involve reviewing the logic for generating the diff and ensuring that it properly handles the file content and input parameters.

Below is the corrected code for the `format_file_in_place` function:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from io import StringIO
import sys
import os
from tokenize import open as tokenize_open
from difflib import unified_diff

class WriteBack:
    NO = 0
    YES = 1
    DIFF = 2

class NothingChanged(Exception):
    pass

def format_file_contents(contents, line_length, fast):
    # Implementation of format_file_contents goes here
    pass

def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: any = None
) -> bool:
    with tokenize_open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast)
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:
        src_name = f"{src.name}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src.name}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = '\n'.join(line for line in unified_diff(src_contents.splitlines(), dst_contents.splitlines(), src_name, dst_name))
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```

In the corrected code, the `unified_diff` function is used to generate the diff contents by comparing the original and formatted file contents. This ensures that the diff output is correctly and accurately generated, addressing the issue in the test case.
