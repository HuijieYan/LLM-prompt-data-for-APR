Potential error location:
The error is likely occurring in the `format_file_in_place` function. The error message indicates that the expected and actual diff outputs are not equal, suggesting that the formatting of the file is not as expected. This could be due to issues in the `format_file_in_place` function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `format_file_in_place` function is not handling the file formatting and diff generation correctly, leading to unexpected diff outputs.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the logic for file formatting and diff generation within the `format_file_in_place` function.
2. Ensure that the correct file paths are being used during formatting and diff generation.
3. Validate the implementation of `format_file_contents` and `diff` functions to ensure they are correctly applied in `format_file_in_place`.
4. Verify the handling of `write_back` and `lock` parameters in the function.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Any
from pathlib import Path
import tokenize
import sys
import os
from io import StringIO
import black

WriteBack = black.WriteBack

def format_file_contents(src_contents: str, line_length: int, fast: bool):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def diff(a: str, b: str, a_name: str, b_name: str) -> str:
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.
    
    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False
    
    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:
        src_name = f"{src.name}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src.name}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```

In the corrected code:
- The function `format_file_in_place` has been revised to properly handle the file formatting and generation of diff outputs.
- The `WriteBack` enum from the `black` module is directly referenced instead of being imported as a separate variable.
- The function now checks the `write_back` parameter directly against `WriteBack.YES` and `WriteBack.DIFF`.
- The correct `write_back` and `lock` parameters are used in the function.
