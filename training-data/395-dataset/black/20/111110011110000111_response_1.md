Potential error location:
The error likely occurs in the `format_file_in_place` function when it tries to write the diff output back to the stdout.

Reason for the bug:
The error message indicates that the diff output is not displaying the full file path, causing the test to fail. This means that the `format_file_in_place` function is not handling the file path correctly when generating the diff output.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, the `format_file_in_place` function needs to properly handle the file path when generating the diff output. It should ensure that the full file path is displayed in the diff output.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
from pathlib import Path
import sys
from black import diff_string

def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None
) -> bool:
    with open(src, "r") as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False
    
    if write_back == write_back.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == write_back.DIFF:
        diff_contents = diff_string(src_contents, dst_contents, src, src)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```
In the corrected code, the `diff_string` function from the `black` module is used to generate the diff output, ensuring that the full file path is included in the output. This should resolve the issue with the diff not displaying the full file path and address the test failure.
