Potential error location: The `write_back` parameter should be compared to the `WriteBack` enum, but it is being compared to an undefined variable `write_back`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `WriteBack` enum is not being used correctly to compare the `write_back` parameter.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Define the `WriteBack` enum and compare the `write_back` parameter to the members of the enum to check the condition.
