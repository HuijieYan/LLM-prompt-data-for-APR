The test case 'test_expression_diff' calls the function 'ff' (which is presumably the 'format_file_in_place' function from the given source code), passing the 'tmp_file' as an argument and setting write_back to 'WriteBack.DIFF'. The test then compares the expected diff with the actual diff obtained from the standard output. The error occurs because the actual diff doesn't match the expected diff.

The potential error location within the 'format_file_in_place' function is where 'write_back' is checked. Currently, the check is implemented as 'if write_back == write_back.YES', which seems to be incorrect.

The reason for the bug is that the comparison 'if write_back == write_back.YES' is comparing the parameter 'write_back' (which is of type WriteBack) with the enum value 'WriteBack.YES', which might not evaluate as expected.

To fix the bug, the comparison in the 'format_file_in_place' function could be replaced with 'if write_back == WriteBack.YES' to ensure a correct comparison with the enum value.

Here's the corrected code for the 'format_file_in_place' function:

```python
def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None  # multiprocessing.Manager().Lock() is some crazy proxy
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:  # correction made here
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:  # preserved original logic
        src_name = f"{src.name}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src.name}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```
By making this correction, the 'format_file_in_place' function should now correctly handle the 'write_back' parameter and produce the expected diff for the given test case.
