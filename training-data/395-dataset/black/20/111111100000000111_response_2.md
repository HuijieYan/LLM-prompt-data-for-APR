The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of incorrect enum values (`write_back.YES` and `write_back.DIFF`) instead of the correct enum values (`WriteBack.YES` and `WriteBack.DIFF`).

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is using incorrect enum values for the `write_back` parameter, which is causing the function to not behave as expected and resulting in the error mentioned.

To fix the bug, the function needs to use the correct enum values for the `write_back` parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None,  # multiprocessing.Manager().Lock() is some crazy proxy
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:  # Correct usage of enum value
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:  # Correct usage of enum value
        src_name = f"{src.name}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src.name}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```
