The error occurs in the `format_file_in_place` function in the conditional statements related to the `write_back` option. The error message indicates that the original file path is not displayed correctly in the diff output, which leads to confusion when comparing the expected and actual diffs.

The bug occurs because the conditional check for `write_back` is comparing `write_back` with an enum `write_back.YES` and `write_back.DIFF`, which is incorrect. Instead, it should be comparing with the enum values (e.g., `WriteBack.YES`, `WriteBack.DIFF`).

To fix the bug, it is necessary to compare the `write_back` parameter with the enum values correctly and also make sure that the full file path is displayed in the diff output.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_file_in_place` function:

```python
from typing import Any
from pathlib import Path
import tokenize
import sys

class WriteBack:
    NO = 'NO'
    YES = 'YES'
    DIFF = 'DIFF'

class NothingChanged(Exception):
    pass

# Corrected function
def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is 'YES', write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:
        src_name = f"{src}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```

In the corrected code, the `write_back` parameter is compared using the enum values `WriteBack.YES` and `WriteBack.DIFF`. Additionally, the full file path is used to display the diff output for better readability and comparison.
