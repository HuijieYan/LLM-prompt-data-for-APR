Potential error location: 
The potential error location is the use of `WriteBack = WriteBack.NO` in the function signature, which is not a valid way to assign a default value to an argument.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurred because the default value for the argument `write_back` was incorrectly set. The correct way to use default arguments is to assign the default value directly to the argument in the function signature.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
Fix the default argument assignment for the `write_back` argument in the function signature.

```python
from enum import Enum
from types import ModuleType

class WriteBack(Enum):
    NO = 0
    YES = 1
    DIFF = 2

def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:
        src_name = f"{src.name}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src.name}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
