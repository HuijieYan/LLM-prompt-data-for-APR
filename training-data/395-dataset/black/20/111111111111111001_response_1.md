The error occurs when comparing the expected diff of a file with its actual output. The expected diff is `'--- <stdin>  (original)\n+++ <stdin>  (formatted)\n'` while the actual diff is `'--- blk_tn7yud7g.log  (original)\n+++ blk_tn7yud7g.log  (formatted)\n@@ -1,8 +1,8 @@\n ...'` and so on. The problem lies in the fact that the `src.name` attribute is not being used to update the file name properly.

The issue arises from the use of `src.name` instead of the file's name when creating `src_name` and `dst_name` strings. The incorrect usage of `src.name` results in unmatching values.

To fix this issue, the `src.name` attribute should be used to properly construct the filenames. The corrected approach should involve using `src.name` for both `src_name` and `dst_name` rather than the incorrect `src` value being used as part of the string as shown in the error message.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None,
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:
        src_name = f"{src.name}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src.name}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```
