The error occurs within the `format_file_in_place` function. Specifically, the issue can be found in the `if write_back == write_back.DIFF` block. 

The error message highlights a comparison mismatch between the expected and actual diff outputs. This suggests that the formatting operation in the `format_file_in_place` function is generating unexpected diff results, leading to the failed assertion in the test case.

One potential reason for this bug could be an incorrect implementation of the diff generation logic in the `format_file_in_place` function. The diffing process may not be correctly identifying the differences between the original and formatted code, leading to unexpected output.

To fix this bug, review the diff generation process in the `format_file_in_place` function. Ensure that it accurately captures the differences between the original and formatted code. Additionally, verify that the `write_back` parameter is appropriately handled to trigger the expected diff generation process.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_file_in_place` function:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Any
from typing import WriteBack

def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None,
) -> bool:
    with open(src, "r") as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
        
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:
        with open(src, "w") as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:
        src_name = f"{src.name} (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src.name} (formatted)"
        # Simulate the diff operation by comparing original vs. formatted contents
        diff_result = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        
        try:
            # Write diff_result to stdout
            # Assuming sys.stdout.write() is the correct method for writing the diff
            sys.stdout.write(diff_result)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()

    return True
```

In the corrected code:
1. Replaced `tokenize.open(src)` with `open(src, "r")` to read the file contents.
2. Fixed the comparison of `write_back` to `WriteBack.YES` and `WriteBack.DIFF`.
3. Introduced a simulated diff operation between `src_contents` and `dst_contents` to ensure accurate diff generation.
4. Ensured correct handling of the `lock` object, assuming it's used for synchronization.

This corrected code should address the diff generation issues and produce the expected output when writing back or generating diffs.
