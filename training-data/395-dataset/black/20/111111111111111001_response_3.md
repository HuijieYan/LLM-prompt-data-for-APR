The error seems to be occurring because the expected and actual diff values are not matching in the test case `test_expression_diff`. The diff values are coming from the `format_file_contents` and `diff` functions.

The potential error location within the `format_file_in_place` function seems to be the calculations in the `diff` function and the `if` condition where the `write_back` parameter is checked. Additionally, there is an issue in properly altering the `src_name` and `dst_name` variables.

The reason behind the bug could be incorrect calculations in the `diff` function which generates the diff data. Also, the `if` condition for the `write_back` parameter might not be evaluating correctly. The `src_name` and `dst_name` variables may not be correctly holding the names of the source and destination files.

To fix the bug, consider making the appropriate changes in the `diff` calculations and modifying the `if` condition for the `write_back` parameter. Additionally, ensure that the `src_name` and `dst_name` variables contain the correct filenames.

Here's the corrected `format_file_in_place` function:

```python
from typing import Dict, Any, Union
from pathlib import Path

class FileContent:
    def __init__(self, data: str):
        self.data = data

class WriteBack:
    NO = 0
    YES = 1
    DIFF = 2

def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None
) -> bool:
    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:
        src_name = str(src) + "  (original)"
        dst_name = str(src) + "  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(
            src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name
        )
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```

In the corrected code, the `WriteBack` enum values are being accessed directly instead of through the module. The `write_back` parameter is modified to consider `WriteBack` values directly. Additionally, the `src_name` and `dst_name` variables are corrected to contain the proper file names.
