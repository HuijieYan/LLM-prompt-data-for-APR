The error message indicates that the comparison between the expected and actual outputs is failing. This suggests that the function `format_file_in_place` is not producing the expected output.

The potential error location within the `format_file_in_place` function is the conditional statement checking for the `write_back` option, where `write_back.YES` and `write_back.DIFF` are expected to be valid options, but they are not defined in the provided code. It seems like `WriteBack` should be an Enum for the different options available for the `write_back` parameter.

The code is using a custom Enum called `WriteBack`, but the actual definition of this Enum is not provided. The `WriteBack` Enum class should be defined with the different options like `YES` and `DIFF`.

To fix the bug, the `WriteBack` Enum needs to be defined and imported from the necessary module. Then, the conditional statements need to be updated to use the Enum options for comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_file_in_place` function after defining the `WriteBack` Enum:

```python
from enum import Enum

class WriteBack(Enum):
    NO = 0
    YES = 1
    DIFF = 2

def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None  # multiprocessing.Manager().Lock() is some crazy proxy
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == WriteBack.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == WriteBack.DIFF:
        src_name = f"{src.name}  (original)"
        dst_name = f"{src.name}  (formatted)"
        diff_contents = diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```
