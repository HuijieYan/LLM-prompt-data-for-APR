The issue with the current code is that the `src.name` value is not being used to display the full path in the `diff` message. Instead, the entire path is being displayed without using `src.name`.

To fix this issue, the `src_name` and `dst_name` variables should be updated to include only the file name, and the full path should be added to the `diff_contents` message.

Here's the corrected code for the `format_file_in_place` function:

```python
def format_file_in_place(
    src: Path,
    line_length: int,
    fast: bool,
    write_back: WriteBack = WriteBack.NO,
    lock: Any = None,  # multiprocessing.Manager().Lock() is some crazy proxy
) -> bool:
    """Format file under `src` path. Return True if changed.

    If `write_back` is True, write reformatted code back to stdout.
    `line_length` and `fast` options are passed to :func:`format_file_contents`.
    """

    with tokenize.open(src) as src_buffer:
        src_contents = src_buffer.read()
    try:
        dst_contents = format_file_contents(
            src_contents, line_length=line_length, fast=fast
        )
    except NothingChanged:
        return False

    if write_back == write_back.YES:
        with open(src, "w", encoding=src_buffer.encoding) as f:
            f.write(dst_contents)
    elif write_back == write_back.DIFF:
        src_name = src.name  # Update src_name to only include the file name
        dst_name = src.name  # Update dst_name to only include the file name
        diff_contents = f'--- {src.resolve()}\n+++ {src.resolve()}\n{diff(src_contents, dst_contents, src_name, dst_name)}'  # Update diff_contents to display the full path
        if lock:
            lock.acquire()
        try:
            sys.stdout.write(diff_contents)
        finally:
            if lock:
                lock.release()
    return True
```

With this correction, the `src_name` and `dst_name` only include the file name, and the `diff_contents` includes the full path when passed to the `diff` function.
