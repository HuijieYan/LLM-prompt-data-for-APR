The bug is likely occurring in the `bracket_split_build_line` function. Based on the error message and test case, it seems that the code produced by Black is invalid, and the specific issue relates to commented out multi-line includes.

The bug seems to occur when there are commented lines within a multi-line import statement. This seems to cause Black to produce invalid syntax when reformatting the code.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `bracket_split_build_line` function to handle commented out multi-line includes correctly. This likely involves ensuring that the function correctly handles comments within multi-line import statements and ensures that the formatting is maintained.

Here's the corrected code for the `bracket_split_build_line` function:

```python
def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0])
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import() and leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```

In the corrected function, we've made a few changes:
1. Removed the `inside_brackets` argument from the `normalize_prefix` call, as it was causing an error.
2. Added parentheses to `original.is_import` to call the method since it's a method, not a property.
3. Ensured that the correct `token` module is used when appending a comma.

These changes should address the issue of invalid code being produced by Black when handling commented out multi-line includes.
