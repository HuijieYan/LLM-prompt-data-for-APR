The error message indicates that Black produced invalid code when trying to format a file with commented out multi-line includes. The specific error points to the line where the import statements are being split and joined.

The issue is likely caused by the inconsistency in handling the commented-out lines in multi-line imports. When Black encounters multi-line imports with commented-out lines, it fails to handle them properly, leading to the production of invalid code.

One possible approach to fixing this bug is to modify the `bracket_split_build_line` function to handle multi-line imports with commented-out lines properly. This can be achieved by checking for commented-out lines within the import statement and adjusting the formatting accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `bracket_split_build_line` function:

```python
def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        
        if leaves:
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            
            if original.is_import:
                for leaf in leaves:
                    if leaf.type == token.COMMENT:
                        leaves.remove(leaf)
                if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                    leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    
    return result
```

In this corrected code, we check for commented-out lines within the import statement and remove them before adding a trailing comma, if necessary, to ensure consistent and valid code generation.

This modification should address the bug and enable Black to handle multi-line imports with commented-out lines properly.
