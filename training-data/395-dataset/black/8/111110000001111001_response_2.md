The bug in the provided code seems to be related to the incorrect setting of the `inside_brackets` flag and incorrectly appending a comma at the end of the list `leaves` when `is_body` is True. This causes inconsistencies in the behavior of the function.

The potential error location within the function is:
```
result.inside_brackets = True
```
This sets the `inside_brackets` flag to True unconditionally, but it should only be set to True if `is_body` is True.

Additionally, the following if block appends a comma to the `leaves` list when `original.is_import` is True, but the logic to determine whether the comma should be appended seems incorrect:
```
if original.is_import:
    if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
        leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `inside_brackets` flag is unconditionally set to True, and the logic for appending a comma seems incorrect.

The possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Setting the `inside_brackets` flag based on the value of `is_body`.
2. Correcting the logic for appending a comma to the `leaves` list.

The corrected code for the problematic function is:
```python
def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
    # Populate the line
    if original.is_import and is_body and leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
        leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```
