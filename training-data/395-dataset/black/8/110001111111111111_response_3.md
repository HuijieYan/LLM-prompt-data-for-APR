Upon analyzing the error message from the test function, it appears that the bug is likely related to the formatting of multi-line import statements with comments. The error message indicates that the output produced by the function is invalid due to a syntax error.

The potential error location within the bracket_split_build_line function is likely in the section where it tries to handle the case of multi-line imports with comments. The bug seems to be related to the handling of trailing commas and comments in such cases.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not handling the scenario of multi-line imports with comments correctly. It fails to properly format and handle the trailing commas and comments in such cases, leading to the generation of invalid code.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to properly handle the case of multi-line imports with comments. This includes correctly adding trailing commas and comments based on the input provided. Additionally, the function may require adjustments to handle indentation levels and comment positions within the code.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            if original.is_import:
                if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                    leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```

The above corrected code includes adjustments to handle the scenario of multi-line imports with comments, ensuring that trailing commas and comments are properly included in the output. It should address the bug related to the formatting of multi-line imports with comments.
