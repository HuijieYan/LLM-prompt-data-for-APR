The error message suggests that the function is not handling the addition of a comma correctly. Let's correct the `bracket_split_build_line` function to address this issue.

The issue arises in the second buggy case where the function should add a comma to the end of the list of leaves, but it does not. I will address this issue by checking if the last leaf is not a comma and then adding a comma to the end if necessary.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
from typing import List, Tuple
import token

class Leaf:
    def __init__(self, token_type: int, value: str):
        self.type = token_type
        self.value = value

class Line:
    def __init__(self, depth: int, leaves: List[Leaf], is_import: bool = False):
        self.depth = depth
        self.leaves = leaves
        self.is_import = is_import

    def comments_after(self, leaf: Leaf) -> List[Leaf]:
        pass

processed_leaves = Tuple[Leaf, ...]

def normalize_prefix(leaf: Leaf, inside_brackets: bool):
    pass

def should_explode(line: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf) -> bool:
    pass

def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import:
                if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                    leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))

    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.leaves.append(leaf)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.leaves.append(comment_after)

    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)

    return result
