The error message provided indicates that Black produced invalid code when trying to format a Python file. The specific issue seems to be related to commented out multi-line includes causing the invalid syntax error.

Upon analysis, it appears that the provided function "bracket_split_build_line" is not directly related to the reported issue. However, it's possible that Black encounters issues with multi-line includes and comments, and this function may be indirectly involved in the error.

The potential error location within the function "bracket_split_build_line" could be in the logic for adding a trailing comma when expected for import statements. This could be related to the issue regarding commented out multi-line includes.

The bug may be occurring because the function does not handle commented out multi-line includes properly, leading to the invalid code produced by Black.

To fix the bug, it is important to ensure that the function correctly handles multi-line includes with comments, such as recognizing when a line is a part of a multi-line import statement and when it's commented out.

Below is the corrected code for the "bracket_split_build_line" function:

```python
from typing import List
from black import Line, Leaf, normalize_prefix, should_explode, token

def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import:
                if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                    # Check for commented out multi-line includes before adding a trailing comma
                    # Ensuring that the line is not completely commented out
                    if not all(leaf.type == token.COMMENT for leaf in leaves):
                        leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```

The corrected code includes a check for commented out multi-line includes before adding a trailing comma to ensure that it is only added when the line is not completely commented out. This adjustment should help to handle the issue regarding multi-line includes and comments, potentially resolving the invalid code produced by Black.
