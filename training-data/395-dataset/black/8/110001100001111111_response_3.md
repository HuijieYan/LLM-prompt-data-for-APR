The bug here seems to be related to the handling of multi-line includes in the source code. The error produced by Black mentions that the output is invalid due to invalid syntax.

Upon analyzing the source code, it appears that the issue might be related to the handling of comments within the `bracket_split_build_line` function. The comments are not being processed properly when generating the new line, which leads to invalid output.

To fix this bug, the function `bracket_split_build_line` needs to be modified to correctly handle comments within the `is_body` condition. It should ensure that comments are properly added to the new line based on the original line.

Here's the corrected code for the `bracket_split_build_line` function:

```python
def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import:
                if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                    leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
        # Populate the line including comments
        for leaf in leaves:
            result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
            for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
                result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    else:
        # Populate the line without changing anything for non-body lines
        for leaf in leaves:
            result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```

This corrected code ensures that comments are properly processed and added to the new line based on the original line. This should resolve the issue of producing invalid output for multi-line includes.
