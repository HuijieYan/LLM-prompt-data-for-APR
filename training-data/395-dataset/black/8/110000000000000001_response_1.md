Potential Error Location: 
The error could be occurring when checking if the original line is an import in the is_body block and when appending a trailing comma to the leaves if it doesn't already exist.

Reasons for the Bug:
1. The original depth of the line is not being modified when is_body is True, which could cause incorrect indentation.
2. There might be an issue with adding a trailing comma if the line is an import. The logic here might not be handling all cases correctly.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the depth of the result line when is_body is True to ensure proper indentation inside brackets.
2. Update the logic for adding a trailing comma to handle all import cases correctly.

Corrected Code:
```python
from typing import List
import token
from leaf import Leaf, Line
from comment import Comment

def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import and not leaves[-1].preformatted.endswith(","):
                leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```
