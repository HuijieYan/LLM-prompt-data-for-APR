The function is returning an unexpected value for the variable `result`.
To correct the function, we need to make sure that the `result` variable is updated correctly based on the input parameters. Additionally, it seems that the function should be handling the commas and comments differently for `is_body` being `True`.

Here's the corrected function:


```python
from typing import List

class Leaf:
    pass

class Line:
    pass

def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)

    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            if original.is_import:
                if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                    leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    else:
        if original.is_import:
            if leaves[-1].type == token.COMMA:
                leaves.pop(-1)
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)

    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    
    return result
```


I have made some assumptions regarding the `normalize_prefix`, `token.COMMA`, and `should_explode` functions. They might need to be defined or imported from the appropriate modules.
