Potential error location: 
The issue seems to be with the `normalize_prefix` function and the `original.is_import` line.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
It appears that the bug is occurring because the `normalize_prefix` function is being called with the `inside_brackets=True` argument, which may be causing unexpected behavior. Additionally, the `original.is_import` condition may not be correctly handling cases where a trailing comma should be added.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the implementation of the `normalize_prefix` function to ensure it is handling the `inside_brackets=True` argument correctly.
2. Review the logic for adding a trailing comma and make sure it is implemented correctly, taking into account all possible scenarios.

Corrected code:

```python
from typing import List
import token

def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            #normalize_prefix(leaves[0]) # removed inside_brackets argument
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import and leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA: 
                leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))

    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```
