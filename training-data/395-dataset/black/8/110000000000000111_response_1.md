Potential error location: The error seems to be related to the addition of comments in the import statement. The function `bracket_split_build_line` is responsible for processing the import statement and handling comments.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug might be occurring because the function is not handling commented-out lines properly. It is not effectively dealing with the commented lines and is producing invalid output.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: The function should be modified to handle commented-out lines within the import statement properly. It needs to ignore the commented lines and only process the active import lines.

Corrected code:

```python
from typing import List
import token
from leaf import Leaf
from line import Line

def bracket_split_build_line(leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import:
                active_leaves = [leaf for leaf in leaves if leaf.text.strip() and leaf.type != token.COMMENT]
                if active_leaves and active_leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                    leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```
In the corrected code, we have added a condition to filter out the commented lines while adding a trailing comma for import statements. This should address the issue with commented-out lines that was leading to invalid output.
