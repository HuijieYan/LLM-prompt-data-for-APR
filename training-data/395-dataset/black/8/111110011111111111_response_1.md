The error message indicates that Black produced invalid code when formatting a test file that included commented out multi-line includes. The issue seems to be related to the handling of commented out multi-line includes by Black.

Upon analyzing the error message and the problematic test case, it seems that the buggy function `bracket_split_build_line` is not handling commented out multi-line includes properly, leading to the production of invalid code by Black.

The potential error location within the `bracket_split_build_line` function may be related to how it processes the leaves and comments after the original line. It seems that the function is not handling the presence of commented out multi-line includes correctly.

One possible approach for fixing the bug could be to revise the logic of the function to properly handle commented out multi-line includes. This may involve ensuring that the function can identify and handle comments within multi-line includes and adjust the formatting accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `bracket_split_build_line` function:

```python
from typing import List

def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import:
                if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                    leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```

In the corrected code, we would address the issues related to the handling of multi-line includes within the `bracket_split_build_line` function. This should prevent the production of invalid code when formatting test files with commented out multi-line includes.
