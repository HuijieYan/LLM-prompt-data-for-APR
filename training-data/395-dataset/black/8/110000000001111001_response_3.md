This buggy function `bracket_split_build_line` appears to be incorrectly handling the addition of a comma in a specific scenario when `is_body` is True. The function should add a comma at the end of the `leaves` list if `original.is_import` is True but the last leaf is not a comma. However, the function is not correctly checking for this condition.

The potential error location is within the block of code:
```python
if original.is_import:
    if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
        leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
```

The bug occurs because the function should only append a comma to the `leaves` list when the last leaf is not already a comma. However, the function is not checking the type of the last leaf correctly. It's comparing the type of the last leaf with `token.COMMA` instead of the type `Leaf` with value `','`.

The bug can be fixed by comparing the type and value of the last leaf in the `leaves` list with the desired value of a comma. If the comparison is false, append a new leaf to the `leaves` list representing a comma.

Here is the corrected code for the `bracket_split_build_line` function:

```python
def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)

    # Add a trailing comma if original is an import and the last leaf is not already a comma
    if is_body and original.is_import and leaves and leaves[-1].value != ",":
        leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
        
    return result
```
