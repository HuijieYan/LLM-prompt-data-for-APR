The bug in the provided function `bracket_split_build_line` is that the `normalize_prefix` function is being called but it is not defined within the function or its scope. This results in a `NameError` when the function is executed.

To fix this bug, the `normalize_prefix` function needs to be defined and imported in order to be used within the `bracket_split_build_line` function.

Here is the corrected code for the function with the `normalize_prefix` function defined and imported:

```python
from typing import List
import token
from some_module import normalize_prefix  # Import the normalize_prefix function from the appropriate module

class Leaf:
    def __init__(self, type, value):
        self.type = type
        self.value = value

class Line:
    def __init__(self, depth, leaves, comments, bracket_tracker, inside_brackets, should_explode, is_import=False):
        self.depth = 0
        self.leaves = leaves
        self.comments = {}
        self.bracket_tracker = None
        self.inside_brackets = False
        self.should_explode = False
        self.is_import = is_import

    def append(self, leaf, preformatted):
        pass

    def comments_after(self, leaf):
        pass

def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the resulting line is one-indented inside brackets and has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Call the normalize_prefix function from the imported module
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import:
                if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                    leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```
