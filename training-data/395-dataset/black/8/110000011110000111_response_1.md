The error message is showing an inconsistency between the expected and actual outputs of the `assertFormatEqual` method in the `BlackTestCase` class. This inconsistency is related to the formatting of import statements with comments.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic that handles adding a trailing comma when expected. This logic is intended to ensure proper formatting of import statements, especially when dealing with multi-line imports containing comments.

The bug occurs because the logic responsible for adding a trailing comma when expected is not functioning as intended. This causes the formatting of import statements with comments to be incorrect.

To fix the bug, the logic for adding a trailing comma when expected needs to be revised and enhanced to properly handle multi-line imports with comments. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the overall import statement formatting logic is robust and can handle various edge cases, including multi-line imports with or without comments.

Here's the corrected code for the `bracket_split_build_line` function:

```python
from typing import List
import token

def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import:
                if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                    # Check for comment after the last leaf
                    last_leaf = leaves[-1]
                    comments_after_last = original.comments_after(last_leaf)
                    if comments_after_last and comments_after_last[-1].value == ",":
                        comments_after_last.pop()  # Remove the trailing comma from comments
                        leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))  # Add a trailing comma
                    leaves.extend(comments_after_last)  # Add comments after the trailing comma
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
