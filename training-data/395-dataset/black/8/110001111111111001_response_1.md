The error message indicates that there is a mismatch between the expected and actual output from the `assertFormatEqual` function. The expected output is different from the actual output, specifically in terms of the placement of commas in the import statement.

The potential error location in the problematic function could be the logic responsible for handling the addition of commas in the import statement when composing the new line.

The bug seems to be related to the logic for adding a trailing comma in import statements. It looks like the current implementation is not handling the addition of the comma correctly when formatting the import statements.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling the addition of commas in import statements should be reviewed and modified to ensure that the formatting aligns with the expected output.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import:
                if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                    leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```
This corrected code addresses the need to correctly handle the addition of trailing commas in import statements when formatting the new line, which should fix the bug.
