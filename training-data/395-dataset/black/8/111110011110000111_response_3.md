The error message indicates that the black tool produced invalid code, particularly when dealing with commented out multi-line includes. The issue seems to be related to the correct handling of comments when formatting the code.

Upon analyzing the buggy code provided and the associated error message, the issue lies in the `bracket_split_build_line` function. This function is responsible for creating new lines with given leaves and respective comments from the original code.

The `bracket_split_build_line` function should properly handle comments, especially when dealing with multi-line imports such as in the test case provided.

The probable reasons for the bug occurrence include improper parsing of comments and handling of multi-line imports within the `bracket_split_build_line` function.

To fix the bug, the `bracket_split_build_line` function needs to be modified to ensure that it handles comments and multi-line imports correctly. This can be achieved by adjusting the logic to properly place and handle comments within the resulting line.

Here's the corrected version of the `bracket_split_build_line` function:

```python
from typing import List
import token
from leaf import Leaf
from line import Line
from normalize_prefix import normalize_prefix

def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """
    Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.
    
    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import:
                if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                    leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))

    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        
        for comment_before in original.comments_before(leaf):
            result.append(comment_before, preformatted=True)
        
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    
    return result
```

In the corrected function, comments are handled before and after each leaf in the `leaves` list, which ensures that comments are correctly placed in the resulting line. Additionally, the logic for adding a trailing comma in imports is retained.

This corrected function should address the bug and ensure that comments and multi-line imports are handled properly.
