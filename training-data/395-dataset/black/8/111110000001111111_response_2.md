The bug occurs because the function `bracket_split_build_line` is not handling the addition of comments and trailing commas properly.

The function is designed to split a line with brackets and respective comments. If `is_body` is True, the result line is indented and a trailing comma is added when expected. However, the function does not handle the addition of comments and trailing commas properly when `is_body` is True.

To fix this bug, the function should handle the addition of comments and trailing commas properly based on the value of `is_body`. Specifically, it should check if the last leaf is followed by comments, and if a trailing comma is expected based on the context.

```python
def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf],
    original: Line,
    opening_bracket: Leaf,
    *,
    is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import and leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```

With these changes, the function should properly handle the addition of comments and trailing commas based on the value of `is_body`.
