Potential Error Location: The error seems to be related to the `bracket_split_build_line` function, specifically to the handling of commas and comments within the `result` line.

Reason for Bug: The bug might be related to the incorrect handling of the trailing comma when expected, as well as the method of appending comments from the `original` line.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
1. Handle the trailing comma when expected based on the presence of `leaves` and the `original.is_import`.
2. Ensure that comments from the `original` line are appended correctly to the `result` line.

Corrected Code:
```python
from typing import List

def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0])  # removed unnecessary inside_brackets argument
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import():  # Changed to method call to is_import
                if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                    leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):  # changed the append method to include comments
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
