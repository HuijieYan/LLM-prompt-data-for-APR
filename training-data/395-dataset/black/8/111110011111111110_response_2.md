The issue with the `bracket_split_build_line` function seems to be related to the handling of comments and trailing commas when formatting multi-line imports. The error message indicates that the produced code is invalid due to a misplaced comma.

To fix this issue, the `bracket_split_build_line` function needs to be revised to properly handle the formatting of multi-line imports with comments and trailing commas.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
from typing import List, Optional
from mymodule import Line, Leaf, token, BracketTracker

def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import and leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))  # Add trailing comma
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```

This function handles the formatting of multi-line imports with comments and ensures that proper indentation, comments, and trailing commas are handled correctly. This should address the issue reported in the test and GitHub issue.
