The error message states that Black produced invalid code due to an "invalid syntax" on line 11. This seems to be a result of the normalization process of multi-line imports with comments in the code.

The issue lies within the `bracket_split_build_line` function, specifically in the handling of comments in the import. When the code encounters comments after the import, it fails to properly handle the formatting, leading to the creation of invalid code.

To fix the bug, the function `bracket_split_build_line` should be updated to properly handle the comments after the import. This might involve adjusting the logic for handling comments and ensuring that the resulting code is valid Python syntax.

Here's the corrected code for the `bracket_split_build_line` function:

```python
def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf],
    original: Line,
    opening_bracket: Leaf,
    *,
    is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import:
                if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                    leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))

    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        if original.comments_after:  # check if comments exist
            for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
                result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```
