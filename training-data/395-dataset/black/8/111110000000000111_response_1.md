Looking at the error message and the test case provided, it seems that the issue is related to the handling of commented lines within the `bracket_split_build_line` function. 

The potential error location within the code is likely related to the handling of comments within the `bracket_split_build_line` function, specifically in the section where it checks for original comments after each leaf.

The bug is likely occurring because the function does not handle commented lines properly, which leads to the production of invalid code by Black.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to properly handle commented lines and ensure that they are included or excluded as necessary to produce valid code.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import List
from tokenize import Token
from black import Line, Leaf, should_explode, normalize_prefix
import token

def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import:
                if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                    leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        comments_after = original.comments_after(leaf)
        if comments_after:
            for comment in comments_after:
                result.append(comment, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```

In the corrected code, we modified the way comments are handled after each leaf, ensuring that they are properly included in the result line. This should address the issue of Black producing invalid code when dealing with commented lines.
