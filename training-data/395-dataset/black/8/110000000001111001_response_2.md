The bug seems to be associated with the `normalize_prefix` method and the `result.should_explode` attribute. The normalization of the prefix and the addition of a trailing comma when expected are not occurring as intended.

The `normalize_prefix` method is intended to remove spurious leading whitespace for the first leaf when `is_body` is True. However, it is not being called for the `leaves[0]` when `is_body` is True.

The `result.should_explode` attribute is intended to be set based on the result of the `should_explode` function, but it is not being set properly based on the input `result`. 

To fix the bug, the following changes can be made to the function:
1. Call the `normalize_prefix` method for the first `leaf` when `is_body` is True.
2. Set the `result.should_explode` attribute based on the result of the `should_explode` function, passing the appropriate parameters.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import List

def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            leaves[0].normalize_prefix(inside_brackets=True)  # Corrected line
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import:
                if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                    leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)  # Corrected line
    return result
```
