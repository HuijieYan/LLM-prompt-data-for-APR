The error seems to be related to the placement of the trailing commas in multi-line includes with commented out lines. The error message indicates that the trailing comma is placed incorrectly, resulting in invalid code.

The potential error location within the code might be around the logic that handles adding trailing commas for imports inside brackets when expected. This is indicated by the error message and associated issue description.

The bug occurs because the function `bracket_split_build_line` incorrectly handles the addition of trailing commas when importing inside brackets. Due to this incorrect handling, it is causing Black to produce invalid code in scenarios where the import has commented out lines.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to review the logic that handles the addition of trailing commas. This logic should be modified to correctly identify when and where to add trailing commas for imports inside brackets, taking into account scenarios where there are commented out lines in the import statement.

Here's the corrected code for the `bracket_split_build_line` function:

```python
from typing import List


class Leaf:
    def __init__(self, type, value):
        self.type = type
        self.value = value


class Line:
    def __init__(self, depth):
        self.depth = depth
        self.inside_brackets = False
        self.should_explode = False
        self.leaves = []

    def append(self, leaf, preformatted):
        self.leaves.append((leaf, preformatted))

    def comments_after(self, leaf):
        return [comment for comment in self.leaves if comment[0] == leaf]


def normalize_prefix(leaf, inside_brackets):
    # implementation of normalize_prefix
    pass


def should_explode(result, opening_bracket):
    # implementation of should_explode
    pass


def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import:
                if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                    leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))

    # Populate the line
    for leaf, preformatted in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)

    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```

It's important to note that the implementation of `normalize_prefix` and `should_explode` functions is not shown here, and they would need to be implemented separately with their logic. Additionally, the `Leaf` and `Line` classes are included to make the code independent for testing.
