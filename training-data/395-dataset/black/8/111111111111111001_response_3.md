The error in the `bracket_split_build_line` function may be caused by the incorrect handling of trailing commas and comments. This could result in the difference between the expected and actual output in the test case.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to ensure that the function handles the insertion of trailing commas and comments correctly, based on the input parameters and the logic defined within the function.

Here's the corrected code for the `bracket_split_build_line` function:

```python
from typing import List, Optional

def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth, inside_brackets=is_body)

    if is_body and leaves:
        if leaves[0].type in [token.NAME, token.STAR]:
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)

        # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
        if original.is_import:
            last_leaf = leaves[-1]
            if last_leaf.type != token.COMMA:
                leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)

    return result
```

In the corrected code, the `inside_brackets` property of the `result` is set based on the `is_body` parameter. Trailing commas are inserted depending on the `original.is_import` property. Additionally, the comments are handled within the loop, ensuring they are added to the `result` line.

By making these changes, the function should handle the input parameters and the logic within the function correctly, resulting in the expected output for the given test case.
