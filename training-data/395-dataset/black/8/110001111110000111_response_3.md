The error occurs when the `assertFormatEqual` method is called within the `test_comments7` test case. The `assertFormatEqual` method compares the expected and actual outputs and raises an `AssertionError` because the two outputs do not match.

The potential error location is within the `bracket_split_build_line` function. It appears that the logic to handle comments and trailing commas within this function is not working correctly. This results in invalid code being produced, which leads to the assertion error in the test case.

The bug occurs because the `bracket_split_build_line` function is not handling comments and trailing commas properly. It fails to correctly populate the result line with comments and to add trailing commas when expected. This leads to the creation of invalid code, which is then flagged as an error during the test.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to revisit the logic within the `bracket_split_build_line` function and ensure that comments are properly added to the result line and trailing commas are inserted when necessary. Reviewing the conditional statements and loops within the function could help identify the specific issues causing the bug.

Here is the corrected code for the `bracket_split_build_line` function:

```python
def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0])
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import():
                if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                    leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in comments_after(original, leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```

In this corrected code:
1. We removed the incorrect `inside_brackets=True` parameter from the `normalize_prefix` function call, as it was causing an error.
2. We added parentheses to the `original.is_import()` function call to correctly call the method.
3. We replaced `original.comments_after(leaf)` with `comments_after(original, leaf)` to call the method correctly.

These changes should address the issues with handling comments and trailing commas, which were causing the bug.
