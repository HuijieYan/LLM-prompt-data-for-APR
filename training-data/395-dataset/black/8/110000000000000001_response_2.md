Potential Error Location:
The potential error is in the if statement that checks for the original.is_import attribute. This attribute does not seem to be defined anywhere in the provided code, so it could be causing a NameError.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The original.is_import attribute is being checked in the code, but it is not clear whether this attribute is a predefined attribute or a custom one. Without the definition of this attribute, the code will raise a NameError.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. If original.is_import is a predefined attribute, make sure it is imported from the appropriate module or defined within the scope of the function.
2. If original.is_import is a custom attribute, it should be defined before it is used in the function.

Corrected Code:
```python
from typing import List
from some_module import Leaf, Line  # Import the necessary classes

def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if 'is_import' in dir(original):  # Check if is_import attribute exists
                if original.is_import:
                    if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                        leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
