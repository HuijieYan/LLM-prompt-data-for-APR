The error seems to be related to the addition of a comma in the output that was not expected. This suggests that the issue might be related to how the function handles the addition of a trailing comma when expected.

Upon analyzing the code for `bracket_split_build_line` function, the issue seems to be in the section where the function checks for a trailing comma when expected. In particular, the conditional check for `original.is_import` seems to be the source of the bug.

The function checks for `original.is_import` and then appends a comma if it is not present in the `leaves` list. However, if the intention is to check for a trailing comma, this condition might not be sufficient as it only considers the presence of the comma.

To fix the bug, the function should first check the last element in the `leaves` list to see if it's a comma, and if not, then append a comma.

Here's the corrected code for the `bracket_split_build_line` function:

```python
def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```

This code checks the last element in the `leaves` list and appends a comma if it's not already present, addressing the issue with the unexpected comma in the output.
