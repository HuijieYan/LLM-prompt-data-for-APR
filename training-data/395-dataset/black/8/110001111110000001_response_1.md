The error message from the test function is an assertion error. The `assertEqual` method is being used to compare the expected output with the actual output, but the two are not equal, leading to the assertion error.

The potential error location within the `bracket_split_build_line` function seems to be the `result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)` line inside the for loop. 

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)` line is using the `append` method with the `preformatted` argument set to True, but the `append` method only has the `leaf` and `preformatted` arguments in its signature, which does not match the function call.

To fix the bug, the `append` method should be adjusted to accept the correct arguments, and the function call within the `bracket_split_build_line` function should be updated accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `bracket_split_build_line` function:

```python
from typing import List, Optional

def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.
    
    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import():
                if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                    leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf)  # Remove preformatted=True argument
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after)  # Remove preformatted=True argument
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(original, opening_bracket)  # Pass original instead of result
    return result
```

In the corrected code:
- Changed `result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)` to `result.append(leaf)` to match the method signature.
- Changed `for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf): result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)` to `for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf): result.append(comment_after)` to match the method signature.
- Changed `result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)` to `result.should_explode = should_explode(original, opening_bracket)` to pass the correct arguments to the `should_explode` function.
