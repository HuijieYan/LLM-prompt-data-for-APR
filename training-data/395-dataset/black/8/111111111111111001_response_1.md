The error seems to be related to the addition of a trailing comma in an import statement in the "expected" value of the test case. The actual and expected values differ, and the error message indicates that the trailing comma is causing the assertion to fail.

The potential error location within the problematic function is when adding the trailing comma in certain conditions. It seems that the function is not correctly handling the addition of the comma when expected, causing the output to differ from the expected value.

The bug occurs because the function is not properly checking whether a trailing comma should be added or not. This leads to the incorrect output and the assertion failure in the test case.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to add a conditional check before adding the trailing comma to ensure that it is only added when necessary. This can be done by checking the last item in the list and verifying if it is a leaf of a specific type. If it is, then the trailing comma should be added; otherwise, it should not be added.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import and leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```

This corrected code includes the conditional check to ensure that the trailing comma is only added when necessary, based on the last leaf in the list.
