The issue in the `bracket_split_build_line` function appears to be with the use of the `is_body` parameter. This parameter is used to determine if the current line is inside brackets and needs special handling. 

The logic seems flawed in the line `if is_body: result.inside_brackets = True` because it incorrectly sets `inside_brackets` based solely on the `is_body` flag, without considering the current state of the line. This logic should probably be based on the existing state of the line (i.e., if it's already inside brackets or not).

To fix this issue, you can modify the logic to check if the line is already marked as `inside_brackets` or not before making any changes based on the `is_body` flag.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body and not original.inside_brackets:  # Check if it's a new body and not already inside brackets
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import:
                if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                    leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```

In this corrected code, we check if the original line is already inside brackets before setting the `inside_brackets` flag in the result. Additionally, the overall logic for handling the `is_body` flag is modified to ensure that it works as intended.
