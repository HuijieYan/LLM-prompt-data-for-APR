The error occurs when there are commented-out multi-line includes within the `from .config` import statement. It appears that the `bracket_split_build_line` function is unable to handle commented-out multi-line includes properly, leading to the generation of invalid code.

The bug occurs because the function does not account for the presence of commented lines within the multi-line import statement. As a result, it fails to properly handle the formatting of the import line and produces invalid output.

To fix this bug, the `bracket_split_build_line` function needs to be updated to handle commented-out multi-line includes correctly. It should account for the presence of commented lines within the input and adjust the formatting accordingly.

Below is the corrected code for the `bracket_split_build_line` function:

```python
def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import:
                last_leaf = leaves[-1] if not leaves[-1].type == token.COMMENT else leaves[-2]
                if last_leaf.type != token.COMMA:
                    leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```
