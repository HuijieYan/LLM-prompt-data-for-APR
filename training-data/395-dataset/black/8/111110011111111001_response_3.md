The error message indicates a test failure due to a mismatch between the expected and actual output. The error message shows specific differences between the expected and actual outputs, which suggests that the bug is in the implementation of the `bracket_split_build_line` function.

Upon analyzing the provided function and its input data, it appears that the bug may be related to the handling of commas within the `leaves` list, especially when `is_body` is True.

One possible reason for the error could be the incorrect handling of the trailing comma when `original.is_import` is True and `is_body` is True. The function may not be correctly adding a comma after the last element in the `leaves` list.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that a trailing comma is added after the last element in the `leaves` list when `original.is_import` is True and `is_body` is True.
Here's the corrected code for the `bracket_split_build_line` function:

```python
def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import and original.is_body:
                if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                    leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```
In the corrected code, an additional condition is added to check if `original.is_import` and `original.is_body` are both True. If they are, a trailing comma is added after the last element in the `leaves` list.

This should resolve the issue of the missing comma and align the expected output with the actual output for the test case.
