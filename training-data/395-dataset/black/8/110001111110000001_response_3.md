The test is asserting that the expected and actual output of a given function, `fs(source)`, are equal. However, the test fails because the expected and actual outputs are not the same, as shown in the error message.

The potential error location within the `bracket_split_build_line` function is in the logic where the trailing comma is added when expected for the `original.is_import` case. This logic is leading to an inconsistency in the output, causing the test to fail.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the addition of a trailing comma. As a result, the output of the function does not match the expected output, leading to the test failure.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to refactor the logic for adding a trailing comma to ensure that it is handled correctly for the `original.is_import` case. Additionally, it may be necessary to review the logic for normalizing the prefix of the leaves when `is_body` is true to ensure that it is consistent.

Here's the corrected code for the `bracket_split_build_line` function:

```python
def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        
    # Populate the line and handle is_import case
    for i, leaf in enumerate(leaves):
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
        
        if is_body:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            if i == 0:
                normalize_prefix(leaf, inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if (i == len(leaves) - 1) and original.is_import:
                if leaf.type != token.COMMA:
                    result.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","), preformatted=True)

    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```

In the corrected code, the logic for normalizing the prefix and adding a trailing comma is refactored to ensure that it is consistently applied for all leaves when `is_body` is true. This should address the inconsistency in the function's output and resolve the test failure.
