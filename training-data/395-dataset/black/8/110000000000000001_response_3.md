Potential error location: The issue may occur in the normalization of the prefix for the first leaf and in ensuring a trailing comma for the body of the line.

Reasons for the bug:
1. The normalization of the prefix for the first leaf inside brackets is not being done correctly.
2. The check for adding a trailing comma when expected for the body of the line may be flawed.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Correctly normalize the prefix for the first leaf inside brackets.
2. Update the logic to ensure a trailing comma for the body of the line based on the original line's type.

Corrected code:

```python
from typing import List
from source import Leaf, Line  # import Leaf and Line from the source module

def bracket_split_build_line(leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Correctly normalize the prefix for the first leaf inside brackets
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected based on the original line's type
            if original.type in ["import", "from"]:
                if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                    leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
