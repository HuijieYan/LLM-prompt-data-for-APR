The issue here seems to be with Black, a Python code formatter, producing invalid code when there are commented out multi-line imports. The error message mentions that Black is unable to format the file due to an "INTERNAL ERROR" and it provides the specific line where the error occurred. Additionally, it also mentions that the output which is causing the issue.

From the error message, it appears that the issue is related to the handling of commented out multi-line imports in the Black code formatter.

Upon analyzing the error message and the provided code snippet, it seems that the issue could be related to how the `bracket_split_build_line` function in the Black codebase is handling the commented out imports.

One potential explanation for this issue could be that the current implementation of the `bracket_split_build_line` function in Black might not be handling commented out multi-line imports correctly, leading to the production of invalid code.

To fix this issue, the `bracket_split_build_line` function in the Black codebase needs to be modified to properly handle commented out multi-line imports. This might involve parsing the code to identify commented out multi-line imports and then appropriately formatting the code without including the commented lines.

Below is the corrected code for the `bracket_split_build_line` function that addresses the issue:

```python
def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import:
                for leaf in leaves:
                    if leaf.type == token.COMMENT:
                        leaves.remove(leaf)

    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)

    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)

    return result
```

In the corrected function, the part where commented imports are being handled has been modified to only include non-commented imports and exclude the commented lines while forming the resulting line. This change ensures that commented out multi-line imports are properly handled without causing the production of invalid code.
