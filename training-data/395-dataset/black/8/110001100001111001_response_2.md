The buggy function `bracket_split_build_line` seems to have a few issues. Some of the parameters used inside the function don't match the formal parameters. Additionally, there are certain operations being performed that could lead to errors or unexpected behavior.

After analyzing the input parameters, the function seems to be incorrectly using the `original` Line object. The result is being initialized based on an iteration through the `leaves` list, and certain modifications are being made based on the `is_body` condition. However, the current implementation could lead to incorrect outcomes and doesn't handle various cases properly.

To fix this issue, it is important to update the function `bracket_split_build_line` to properly handle the given context. The `leaves`, `is_body`, and `original` should be used effectively to create the `result` Line object.

Here's the corrected code for the `bracket_split_build_line` function:

```python
def bracket_split_build_line(leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False) -> Line:
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            if original.is_import:
                if leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                    leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```

In the corrected function, the `original` Line object is being used to reference the comments rather than to initialize the `result` Line object. The `is_body` condition is appropriately handled, and the comments are being added to the `result` Line object based on the `original` Line. The `leaves` are iterated through and appended to the `result` Line, with appropriate modifications based on the `is_body` condition.

This corrected approach ensures that the function works as intended and handles the given input parameters effectively.
