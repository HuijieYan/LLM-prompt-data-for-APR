The error message shows that the `assertFormatEqual` function is failing, indicating that the `fs` function is not producing the expected output. This test is related to testing comments and the formatting of the source code.

The potential error location is within the `bracket_split_build_line` function, particularly in the logic related to adding a trailing comma when expected for an import statement inside a bracket. This logic seems to be causing the formatting issue, as suggested by the error message regarding the presence or absence of commas in the generated source code.

The bug is occurring because the logic to add a trailing comma for import statements inside a bracket might not be implemented correctly. This can lead to discrepancies in the formatting of the source code, causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to review and correct the logic related to adding a trailing comma for import statements inside a bracket. A comprehensive approach to handle various scenarios of import statements and bracket handling is needed to ensure the correctness of the formatting.

Here's the corrected code for the `bracket_split_build_line` function:

```python
def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected for import statements.
            if original.is_import and not original.ends_with_comma():
                leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))  # Add a trailing comma
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```

In the corrected code, the condition for adding a trailing comma for import statements has been updated to check if the original line does not already end with a comma. If it doesn't, a trailing comma is added to the `leaves` list. This should fix the bug related to the formatting issue in the test case.
