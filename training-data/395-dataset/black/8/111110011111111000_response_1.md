The buggy function `bracket_split_build_line()` contains some logic errors and unexpected behavior based on the provided input and expected output. It's expected to return a `Line` object with specific attributes, but the actual return values do not match the expected values.

To fix the function, the following changes can be made:

```python
from typing import List

def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import and leaves[-1].type != ',':
                leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))
    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)
    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)
    return result
```

The `bracket_split_build_line()` function has been fixed in the following ways:

1. The condition `if original.is_import and leaves[-1].type != ','` has been added to ensure that a comma is added at the end if the line is an import.

2. The function now properly creates a `Line` object with the expected attributes and return it.

With these changes, the function `bracket_split_build_line` should now produce the expected results.

The corrected function can now be tested with the provided test cases to verify its correctness. If the test still fails, further investigation may be needed to identify the underlying issue.
