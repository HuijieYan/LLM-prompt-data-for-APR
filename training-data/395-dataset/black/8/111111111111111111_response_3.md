The error in the code is likely due to the function `bracket_split_build_line` not handling the situation where the last leaf in the `leaves` list is not a comma (`,`). This causes the error in the test case where the output contains an extra comma.

The function should check if the last leaf in the `leaves` list is a comma, and if not, append a comma before closing the parenthesis.

Here's the corrected code for the `bracket_split_build_line` function:

```python
def bracket_split_build_line(
    leaves: List[Leaf], original: Line, opening_bracket: Leaf, *, is_body: bool = False
) -> Line:
    """Return a new line with given `leaves` and respective comments from `original`.

    If `is_body` is True, the result line is one-indented inside brackets and as such
    has its first leaf's prefix normalized and a trailing comma added when expected.
    """
    result = Line(depth=original.depth)
    if is_body:
        result.inside_brackets = True
        result.depth += 1
        if leaves:
            # Since body is a new indent level, remove spurious leading whitespace.
            normalize_prefix(leaves[0], inside_brackets=True)
            # Ensure a trailing comma when expected.
            if original.is_import and leaves[-1].type != token.COMMA:
                leaves.append(Leaf(token.COMMA, ","))

    # Populate the line
    for leaf in leaves:
        result.append(leaf, preformatted=True)
        for comment_after in original.comments_after(leaf):
            result.append(comment_after, preformatted=True)

    if is_body:
        result.should_explode = should_explode(result, opening_bracket)

    return result
```
