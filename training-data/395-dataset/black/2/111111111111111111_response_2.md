The error occurs in the `generate_ignored_nodes` function, specifically in the conditional statement `if is_fmt_on`. This statement should not return, but rather continue to the next iteration of the while loop.

The bug occurs because the `is_fmt_on` flag is not properly updated within the nested loop for looping through the comments. As a result, the function exits prematurely.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `is_fmt_on` flag when a comment with a value of `# fmt: on` or `# fmt: off` is encountered. Additionally, we need to handle the case where the end of the block is reached and update the `is_fmt_on` flag accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_ignored_nodes` function:

```python
def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False

        yield container

        if is_fmt_on:
            return

        container = container.next_sibling
```

In this corrected code, we ensure that the `is_fmt_on` flag is properly updated based on the comment values. We also remove the unnecessary parameter `is_endmarker` from the `list_comments` function call, as it is not needed for this use case.
