Potential error location: The issue lies in the loop that checks for "fmt on" and "fmt off" comments within the `list_comments` function call.

Reasons behind the bug: The `list_comments` function call is passing an invalid argument "is_endmarker". Additionally, the logic to check for "fmt on" and "fmt off" comments is incomplete and incorrect.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Remove the unnecessary "is_endmarker" argument from the `list_comments` function call.
2. Revise the logic to correctly check for "fmt on" and "fmt off" comments within the loop.

Corrected code:

```python
from typing import List, Optional, Iterator, Union

# Corrected list_comments function signature
def list_comments(prefix: str, is_endmarker: bool = False) -> List[Union[Comment, Expr]]:
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix):
            if comment.value == FMT_ON:  # Check for "fmt on" comment
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value == FMT_OFF:  # Check for "fmt off" comment
                is_fmt_on = False
        if is_fmt_on:
            return  # Exiting the function may not be the intended behavior. Consider revising this logic.

        yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```
