The error message is provided by the `assertFormatEqual` method, which is called within the `test_fmtonoff4` test case. The error message indicates that the expected and actual outputs are not matching, which leads to an assertion error.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `generate_ignored_nodes` function. It seems that the function is not working as intended, resulting in the incorrect output for the `test_fmtonoff4` test case.

The bug in the `generate_ignored_nodes` function seems to be related to the logic for checking the `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` comments. The function is not correctly handling these comments, which ultimately leads to incorrect output when these comments are encountered in the code.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly check for `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` comments and update the `is_fmt_on` flag accordingly. Additionally, the function should continue to yield container nodes until the end of the block, as mentioned in the function's docstring.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_ignored_nodes` function:

```python
from typing import Iterator, Optional

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.
    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    is_fmt_on = False  # Initialize is_fmt_on flag
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        if is_fmt_on:
            yield container
        container = container.next_sibling
```

In the corrected code:
- The `is_fmt_on` variable is initialized outside the loop to ensure that the state is maintained across iterations.
- The `yield container` statement is placed within the loop in accordance with the docstring's description of the function's behavior.
- Other minor fixes and adjustments have been made to ensure the function's correctness.
