The error seems to occur due to a mismatch between the expected and actual output of the `fs` function when called with the source as an argument.

Upon analyzing the function `generate_ignored_nodes`, it seems that the issue lies within the `for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):` loop. The `list_comments` function is accepting an additional parameter `is_endmarker`, but it is not provided in the call.

The potential reason behind this bug is that the `list_comments` function is being called with an incorrect signature which does not match the provided input arguments.

To fix this bug, the code should be modified to provide the required arguments when calling the `list_comments` function. Additionally, the loop inside the `generate_ignored_nodes` function needs to properly handle the case when the condition `is_fmt_on` is met.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_ignored_nodes` function:

```python
def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix):  # removed the is_endmarker=False argument
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
                break  # exit the loop once the condition is met
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                break  # exit the loop once the condition is met
        if is_fmt_on:
            return

        yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```

With the corrected code, the function `list_comments` is called without the `is_endmarker` parameter, and the loop handling the comments now properly exits when the condition for `FMT_ON` is met.
