The error message in the test function `test_fmtonoff4` shows a comparison failure between the expected and actual outputs. The failure occurs during a call to the `assertFormatEqual` method, which compares the expected output with the actual output. The assertion fails, indicating a discrepancy between the two outputs.

Based on the error message, it seems that the function `generate_ignored_nodes` is not producing the expected output in some scenarios, leading to the assertion failure.

Looking at the code for the `generate_ignored_nodes` function, the potential bug is in the `while` loop where the code checks for the container's type and processes comments. The issue seems to be related to the logic for checking if the `container` should be yielded or not.

The `is_fmt_on` variable is used to track whether the `# fmt: on` comment is encountered. However, in the current implementation, the function returns early if `is_fmt_on` is true, which might cause the premature termination of the loop.

To fix this bug, the logic inside the `while` loop needs to be adjusted so that the container is yielded before checking if the formatting is turned on or off.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        yield container  # Yield the container first

        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False

        if is_fmt_on:
            return

        container = container.next_sibling
```

In this corrected code, the `yield container` statement is placed before the comment processing and the check for `is_fmt_on`. This ensures that the container is always yielded before processing the comments, preventing premature termination of the loop.
