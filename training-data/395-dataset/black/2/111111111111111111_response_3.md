The error occurs in the buggy function `generate_ignored_nodes` due to the premature return in the `while` loop. This prevents the successful iteration through the generator and affects the outcome of the test case.

The issue arises from the premature return statement within the loop. The loop should continue iterating through the generator instead of returning when the condition is met.

To fix this issue, the premature return inside the `while` loop should be modified to continue the loop and allow the generator to yield the expected values. Additionally, the condition for checking `is_fmt_on` should be updated to ensure successful iteration through the block.

Below is the corrected code for the `generate_ignored_nodes` function:

```python
def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        if not is_fmt_on:
            yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```

The modification ensures that the function will continue to iterate through the generator until the specified condition is met, and the premature return inside the loop has been replaced. This updated function should address the issue reported in the test case.
