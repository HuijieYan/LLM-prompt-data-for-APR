The issue comes from the `generate_ignored_nodes` function, where the `if is_fmt_on` check and the `yield container` statement are misplaced. This causes the function to return early from the loop without yielding the `container` value.

To fix the bug, the `is_fmt_on` check and the `yield container` statement have to be rearranged and an additional condition is needed to continue the loop. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.
    
    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix):  # Removed is_endmarker=False
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        if not is_fmt_on:  # Changed the condition to continue the loop
            yield container  # Moved the yield statement here
        container = container.next_sibling
```

In the corrected code, the `yield container` statement is moved to be inside the loop and an additional condition is added to continue the loop until the end of the block is reached, ensuring that the correct nodes are yielded.
