The issue appears to be related to the logic in the `generate_ignored_nodes` function. The function is meant to generate all leaves until `# fmt: on` and stop at the end of the block. However, based on the provided description of the bug, it seems that the function is not correctly handling the `# fmt: on` comments that are crossing block boundaries and decorators.

The potential error location within the function is likely the section where it checks the comments and determines if the `# fmt: on` is encountered. The current logic seems to be incorrect as it does not handle crossing block boundaries and decorators properly.

The bug occurs because the function is prematurely returning when encountering the `# fmt: on` comment before actually processing all the leaves until the end of the block. This is most likely due to the incorrect handling of the `# fmt: on` comments and the premature return inside the loop.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the `# fmt: on` comments and ensure that it properly iterates through all the leaves until the end of the block, especially when crossing block boundaries and decorators.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_ignored_nodes` function:

```python
def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        if is_fmt_on:
            is_fmt_off_found = False
            for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
                if comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                    is_fmt_off_found = True
            if is_fmt_off_found:
                is_fmt_on = False
    
        if not is_fmt_on:
            yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```

The corrected function now properly handles the `# fmt: on` comments and ensures that it iterates through all the leaves until the end of the block, taking into account crossing block boundaries and decorators.
