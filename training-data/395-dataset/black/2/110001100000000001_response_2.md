Potential error location: The `list_comments` function is being called with two arguments (container.prefix and is_endmarker) when the function only takes one argument (prefix). This is likely causing the error.

Reasons for the bug: The `list_comments` function is being called with the wrong number of arguments, which is leading to a TypeError.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Remove the second argument (is_endmarker=False) from the `list_comments` function call.

Corrected code:

```python
# this is the fixed function
def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.
    
    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        if is_fmt_on:
            return

        yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```
