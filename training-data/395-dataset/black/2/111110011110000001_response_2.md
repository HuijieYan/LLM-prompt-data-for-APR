The test is checking the equality of the expected and actual output of the `fs` function. The error message indicates that the output strings are not equal.

Upon analyzing the code, it seems that the function `generate_ignored_nodes` is not correctly implemented. The function is expected to generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`, but it is not functioning as intended.

The potential error in the code lies within the while loop and the processing of comments. The function seems to be checking for `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` comments in the container's prefix, but the logic is flawed and does not handle the comments properly.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function does not properly iterate through the nodes and check for `# fmt: on` comment. It seems to be returning prematurely without properly handling the `# fmt: on` condition.

To fix this bug, the function should iterate through the nodes and check for the `# fmt: on` comment properly. It should continue generating the nodes until it encounters the `# fmt: on` comment.

Below is the corrected code for the `generate_ignored_nodes` function:

```python
from typing import Optional, Iterator

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.
    
    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                return  # Skip the rest if # fmt: on is found
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
            elif comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
        if not is_fmt_on:
            yield container
        container = container.next_sibling
```

In the corrected code, the `is_fmt_on` flag is properly handled and the function continues generating the nodes until it encounters `# fmt: on` comment. The return statement is updated to skip the remaining nodes if `# fmt: on` is found.
