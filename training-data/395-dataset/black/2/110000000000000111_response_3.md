The issue seems to be related to the behavior of the `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` comments within the provided `generate_ignored_nodes` function. The function is intended to generate all leaf nodes until it encounters `# fmt: on`, at which point it should stop generating and return.

The potential error location within the function is the loop condition `if is_fmt_on:` and the subsequent `return`. The function is returning immediately when `# fmt: on` is encountered, which is not the intended behavior. Instead, it should continue generating nodes until it reaches the end of the block or encounters `# fmt: off`.

The bug occurs because the function prematurely returns when encountering `# fmt: on`, instead of continuing until reaching the end of the block. This prevents the correct behavior of stopping at the end of the block or when encountering `# fmt: off`.

To fix the bug, the function should continue generating nodes even after encountering `# fmt: on`, and stop when it reaches the end of the block or finds `# fmt: off`. This can be achieved by modifying the loop condition and implementing a separate check for `# fmt: off`.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_ignored_nodes` function:

```python
from typing import Iterator, Optional
from whatever import LN, Leaf, token, list_comments, container_of

FMT_ON = ["# fmt: on"]
FMT_OFF = ["# fmt: off"]

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    fmt_off_encountered = False
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER and not fmt_off_encountered:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                fmt_off_encountered = True
        if fmt_off_encountered:
            break

        yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```

In the corrected code, the loop condition has been modified to check for the presence of `# fmt: off` and a flag `fmt_off_encountered` is used to indicate its presence. This allows the function to continue generating nodes until it reaches the end of the block or encounters `# fmt: off`.
