The error is related to the `generate_ignored_nodes` function failing to properly interpret `# fmt: on` markers. This bug is causing the formatter to behave incorrectly when crossing block boundaries and decorators, resulting in formatting issues.

The potential error location within the buggy function is the loop that checks for `# fmt: on`. The loop iterates through all the comments in the container's prefix but does not properly handle nested blocks or track the state of the `# fmt: on` toggle across different blocks.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function iterates through the comments in the container's prefix and sets the `is_fmt_on` flag based on the last `# fmt: on` or `# fmt: off` comment encountered. This causes issues when nested block comments need to be properly handled, and the state of `# fmt: on` should be tracked across different blocks.

To fix the bug, the following approach can be used:
- Introduce a stack to track the state of `# fmt: on` across nested blocks.
- Update the loop logic to correctly interact with the stack and manage the state of `# fmt: on`.
- Modify the loop to handle nested blocks and properly set the `is_fmt_on` flag based on the correct nested block state.

The corrected function for `generate_ignored_nodes`:

```python
def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    
    fmt_on_stack = [True]  # Initialize the stack with `# fmt: on` as the default state
    
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        
        # Check the current state of `# fmt: on` based on the stack
        is_fmt_on = fmt_on_stack[-1]
        
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                fmt_on_stack.append(True)  # Push `# fmt: on` state on the stack
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                fmt_on_stack.pop()  # Pop the top state from the stack
            elif is_fmt_on:  # If `# fmt: on` is true
                yield container  # Yield the container
        
        container = container.next_sibling
```

The corrected function introduces a stack `fmt_on_stack` to track the state of `# fmt: on` across nested blocks. It also ensures that the correct state of `# fmt: on` is maintained and utilized when yielding the container.
