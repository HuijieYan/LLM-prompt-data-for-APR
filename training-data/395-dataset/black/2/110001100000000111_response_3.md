The bug seems to be occurring in the `generate_ignored_nodes` function. It's intended to generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`, but it's currently returning without yielding anything if `# fmt: on` is encountered.

The reason behind the bug is that when `# fmt: on` is encountered, the function immediately returns without yielding the current `container`. This causes the loop to prematurely exit without yielding all the nodes.

To fix this bug, we can simply remove the `return` statement after encountering `# fmt: on` and continue looping until the end marker is reached.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_ignored_nodes` function:

```python
def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        if is_fmt_on:
            # Remove the return statement
            pass

        yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```
