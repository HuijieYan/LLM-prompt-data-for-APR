The issue seems to be related to not correctly identifying the "# fmt: on" directive when generating ignored nodes from a leaf. The function `generate_ignored_nodes` is supposed to generate all nodes until it reaches the `# fmt: on` directive. However, the current implementation doesn't handle this properly as it's not correctly identifying the `is_fmt_on` condition.

One possible approach to fixing this bug is to correctly identify and handle the `# fmt: on` directive within the `generate_ignored_nodes` function. This may involve checking the value of the comment in the loop and updating the `is_fmt_on` flag accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_ignored_nodes` function:

```python
from typing import Iterator, Optional, List
from leaf import Leaf
from node import LN
from proto_comment import ProtoComment

FMT_ON = ["# fmt: on"]
FMT_OFF = ["# fmt: off"]

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.
    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        if is_fmt_on:
            break

        yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```

This code includes handling the `# fmt: on` directive correctly inside the loop, and it breaks out of the loop when encountering the `# fmt: on` directive, which seems to be the expected behavior based on the bug description.
