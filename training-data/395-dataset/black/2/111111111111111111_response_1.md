The error message indicates that the "fmt: on" command is not working as intended and is causing mismatched code between expected and actual output. This relates to the expected behavior of the "generate_ignored_nodes" function.

Upon analyzing the code, it appears that the issue is with the "generate_ignored_nodes" function as it fails to correctly identify the "fmt: on" command within the block. This could be due to the way the function handles comments and container traversal.

The bug occurs because the function is not correctly identifying the "fmt: on" command within the block. This may be due to issues with how comments are processed and how the function handles container traversal.

To fix this bug, the "generate_ignored_nodes" function should be updated to properly handle comments and identify the "fmt: on" command within the container's block. This may involve refining the logic for processing comments and container traversal.

Here's the corrected code for the "generate_ignored_nodes" function:

```python
from typing import List, Optional, Iterator
from black import Leaf, LN, ProtoComment, FMT_ON, FMT_OFF

def container_of(leaf: Leaf) -> LN:
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def list_comments(prefix: str, is_endmarker: bool) -> List[ProtoComment]:
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        if is_fmt_on:
            break

        yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```

In this update, the function iterates through the comments within the container's block and correctly identifies the "fmt: on" command. If the "fmt: on" command is found, the loop breaks, and the function stops generating leaves. This should resolve the issue where the "fmt: on" command was not being correctly handled by the original function.
