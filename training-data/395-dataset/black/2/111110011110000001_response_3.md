This error seems to be related to the formatting of the output produced by the `generate_ignored_nodes` function, as it is failing the equality check in the `assertFormatEqual` method.

The potential error location within the `generate_ignored_nodes` function could be the `return` statement inside the `while` loop. This is causing the function to terminate prematurely, which may be leading to incorrect output.

The bug is likely occurring because of the premature termination of the function due to the `return` statement inside the `while` loop. As a result, the function is not able to generate all the ignored nodes until `# fmt: on`.

One approach to fixing this issue is to remove the `return` statement and use a flag to indicate whether the `# fmt: on` directive is encountered. By doing so, the function can continue generating the ignored nodes until the end, without prematurely terminating.

Here is the corrected code for the `generate_ignored_nodes` function:

```python
from typing import Iterator

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    fmt_on_encountered = False
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                fmt_on_encountered = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                fmt_on_encountered = False
        if fmt_on_encountered:
            break

        yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```

By making this change, the function should be able to generate all leaves until `# fmt: on` as intended, and the test case should pass without any formatting issues.
