The bug seems to be related to the handling of `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` comments within the provided function. The function `generate_ignored_nodes` is intended to generate all leaves until encountering `# fmt: on` within the container, stopping at the end of the block.

From the test case, it's evident that the behavior of `# fmt: on` is incorrect. The error message specifically mentions the discrepancy between the expected and actual output. This indicates that the buggy function is not correctly handling the `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` comments.

Upon analyzing the code, it's apparent that the issue lies within the loop that checks for `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` within the comments. It seems that the state `is_fmt_on` is not being updated correctly based on the comments.

The issue seems to be occurring because the `is_fmt_on` flag is being reset for every comment that is processed. Instead, the intended behavior should be to set `is_fmt_on` based on the last occurrence of `# fmt: on` or `# fmt: off` comments in the provided container.

To fix this, the loop that checks for comments within the container and sets the `is_fmt_on` flag should be modified to update the flag based on the last occurrence of `# fmt: on` or `# fmt: off` comments in the container.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_ignored_nodes` function:

```python
from typing import Iterator, Optional

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    is_fmt_on = False  # Initialize the flag
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        if is_fmt_on:
            return

        yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```

This correction involves initializing the `is_fmt_on` flag outside the loop and modifying the loop to update this flag based on the last occurrence of `# fmt: on` or `# fmt: off` comments in the container. This approach ensures that the flag reflects the correct state based on the comments encountered.
