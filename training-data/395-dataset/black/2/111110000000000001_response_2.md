Potential error location: The function may not be correctly identifying when to stop generating ignored nodes based on the presence of `# fmt: on` comments.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The `is_fmt_on` flag is not being updated correctly within the for loop, and there is no handling for when `is_fmt_on` is True.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: 
1. Update the `is_fmt_on` flag within the for loop based on the presence of `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` comments.
2. Check the `is_fmt_on` flag before yielding or returning a value from the function.

Corrected code:

```python
from typing import Iterator, Optional

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        if is_fmt_on:
            break

        yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```
