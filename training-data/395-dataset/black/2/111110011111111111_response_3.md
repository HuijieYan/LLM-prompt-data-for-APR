The error occurred when the expected and actual outputs did not match in the test function `test_fmtonoff4`. The error message indicates that the formatting of the code is not as expected due to the presence of `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` directives.

The issue seems to be related to the incorrect handling of the `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` directives in the `generate_ignored_nodes` function. The function is not correctly identifying the start and end of the block delimited by these directives which leads to incorrect formatting.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic used to detect the `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` directives in the comments and deciding when to stop generating nodes.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to update the logic inside the `generate_ignored_nodes` function to correctly handle the `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` directives by considering the block structure and adjusting the generation of nodes accordingly. This may involve checking for the presence of these directives and determining the block boundaries to correctly include or exclude nodes based on the directives.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Optional, Iterator
from black import LN, Leaf, Node
from black.comments import list_comments
from black.nodevisitor import container_of

FMT_ON = {"# fmt: on"}
FMT_OFF = {"# fmt: off"}

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        if is_fmt_on:
            break

        yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```

In the corrected code:
- We have updated the function to correctly handle the logic for identifying the `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` directives within the comments and adjusting the block generation accordingly.
- The use of `yield` and `return` has been appropriately handled to ensure that the function continues generating nodes until the correct point as per the directives.
