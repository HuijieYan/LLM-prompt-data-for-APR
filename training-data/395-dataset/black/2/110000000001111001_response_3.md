The potential error in the function is the premature return when `is_fmt_on` is True. This means that the function might not yield all the necessary nodes.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function generates ignored nodes until it encounters `# fmt: on`, but if it encounters this comment before the end of the block, it should still yield the remaining nodes.

To fix the bug, we should remove the return statement inside the loop and continue iterating through the nodes until the end of the block.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
from typing import Iterator, Optional
from .some_module import Leaf, LN, container_of, list_comments, FMT_ON, FMT_OFF

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        if is_fmt_on:
            break  # Exit the loop but continue yielding nodes

        yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```
