The bug seems to be related to the function `generate_ignored_nodes`. It is not correctly handling the `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` comments when crossing block boundaries and decorators.

The issue occurs because the function does not properly check for `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` comments when traversing through the container nodes.

To fix the bug, a possible approach could be to modify the function to check for `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` comments within the container nodes and its child nodes recursively. This would ensure that the function can correctly identify the presence of these comments even when crossing block boundaries and decorators.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Iterator, Optional

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    def is_fmt_on(container):
        is_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_on = False
        return is_on

    def generate_nodes(container):
        if container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
            is_fmt_on_container = is_fmt_on(container)
            if is_fmt_on_container:
                return

            yield container

            for child in container.get_children():
                for node in generate_nodes(child):
                    yield node

    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    for node in generate_nodes(container):
        yield node
```

In the corrected code, the `generate_ignored_nodes` function has been modified to use a nested function `generate_nodes` that recursively traverses through the container nodes and their child nodes, checking for `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` comments. The `is_fmt_on` function is used to determine whether the current container has an active `# fmt: on`. This approach ensures that the function can correctly handle the comments when crossing block boundaries and decorators.
