The issue with the `generate_ignored_nodes` function is that it is returning early with the `return` statement. This causes the function to stop looping and exit prematurely. Instead, the function should only return after the loop has finished executing.

The loop should continue until the `container` is not None and its type is not `token.ENDMARKER`. Additionally, the `is_fmt_on` flag should track if the `# fmt: on` comment has been encountered.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_ignored_nodes` function:

```python
def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix):
            if comment.value == '# fmt: on':
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value == '# fmt: off':
                is_fmt_on = False
        if is_fmt_on:
            break

        yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```

This corrected code ensures that the loop continues until the end of the block is reached and that the correct condition is used for checking `# fmt: on` comments.
