The error message indicates that the assertFormatEqual function within the test_fmtonoff4 test case is failing to compare the expected and actual outputs. The specific assertion failure message shows a mismatch between the expected and actual outputs, highlighting differences related to the presence and absence of formatting directives such as "# fmt: off" and "# fmt: on".

The potential error location within the generate_ignored_nodes function is the logic related to detecting and handling the "# fmt: on" and "# fmt: off" directives. The current implementation does not seem to correctly handle these directives when they occur across block boundaries and decorators, leading to the observed test case failure.

The bug seems to be occurring due to the incorrect handling of "# fmt: on" and "# fmt: off" directives when they occur across block boundaries and decorators. The logic in the generate_ignored_nodes function needs to be adjusted to properly handle these cases.

To fix this bug, the generate_ignored_nodes function should be updated to accurately handle the "# fmt: on" and "# fmt: off" directives when they occur across block boundaries and decorators. This may involve revising the logic within the function to properly track the effects of these directives and ensure that their influence is correctly applied to the subsequent code blocks.

The corrected code for the generate_ignored_nodes function is provided below:

```python
from typing import Iterator, Optional
from AST import Leaf, LN, token

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.
    
    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    is_fmt_on = False
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER and not is_fmt_on:
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
                
        if not is_fmt_on:
            yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```

This corrected code includes adjustments to the logic for handling "# fmt: on" and "# fmt: off" directives, ensuring that their effects are properly tracked and applied across block boundaries and decorators.
