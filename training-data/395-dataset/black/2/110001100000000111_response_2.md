Potential Error Location: The issue seems to be with the `generate_ignored_nodes` function, specifically with the handling of the `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` comments. The function is not correctly iterating through the comments and checking for the presence of `# fmt: on`.

Reasons for the Bug:
The issue is occurring because the function is not correctly identifying the `# fmt: on` comment and stopping the generation of leaves.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to iterate through the comments correctly, check for the presence of `# fmt: on`, and then stop the generation of leaves when found.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_ignored_nodes` function:

```python
from typing import Iterator, Optional
from black import Leaf, LN, token

# Corrected function
def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        comments = list_comments(container.prefix)
        for comment in comments:
            if comment.value == "# fmt: on":
                is_fmt_on = True
                break

        if is_fmt_on:
            break

        yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```

In the corrected function:
- We iterate through the comments correctly and check for the presence of `# fmt: on`.
- If we find `# fmt: on`, we break from the loop and stop the generation of leaves.
- If `# fmt: on` is not found, we continue generating leaves until the end of the block.

These corrections should address the issue where the formatter commands were not functioning as expected.
