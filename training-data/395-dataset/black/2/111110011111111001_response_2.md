Based on the error message provided, it seems that the function `generate_ignored_nodes` is not producing the expected output. The error message indicates a comparison mismatch between the expected and actual results related to formatting and indentation, suggesting a possible issue within the function's logic.

The bug seems to be in the logic related to tracking the state of the `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` comments. The current function does not handle the comment logic correctly, leading to incorrect processing of the input source code.

To fix the bug, you should update the logic related to tracking the `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` comments. Additionally, the logic of generating ignored nodes until `# fmt: on` should be corrected to produce the expected output.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Iterator, Optional
from lib2to3.pgen2.tokenize import generate_tokens

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    FMT_ON = "# fmt: on"
    FMT_OFF = "# fmt: off"
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        fmt_off_found = False

        for toktype, tokval, _, _, _ in generate_tokens(container.prefix):
            if toktype == token.COMMENT:
                if tokval.strip() == FMT_OFF:
                    fmt_off_found = True
                elif tokval.strip() == FMT_ON:
                    return

        if not fmt_off_found:
            yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```

In the corrected code, the logic for tracking `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` comments has been updated to correctly handle the comments and yield the expected nodes until `# fmt: on`.

By fixing this logic, the function should now generate the expected result and pass the provided test case.
