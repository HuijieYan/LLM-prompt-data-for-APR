The issue seems to be related to the incorrect handling of the "# fmt: on" and "# fmt: off" comments when crossing block boundaries and decorators. The buggy function `generate_ignored_nodes` is intended to generate all leaves until it encounters `# fmt: on`, stopping at the end of the block.

The potential error location within the function is the conditional check for `is_fmt_on` inside the `while` loop. The issue might be related to the incorrect handling of the `FMT_ON` and `FMT_OFF` values, causing the function to return prematurely and not properly iterating through the containers.

The bug occurs because the implementation does not properly handle the "# fmt: on" and "# fmt: off" comments when crossing block boundaries and decorators. The function needs to correctly identify these comments and only stop generating leaves when encountering `# fmt: on`.

To fix the bug, the function should iterate through the containers and properly identify the `# fmt: on` comment within the block. If the function encounters `# fmt: on`, it should stop generating leaves. Additionally, the `is_fmt_on` variable should be initialized outside the `while` loop and updated within the loop based on the presence of `FMT_ON` and `FMT_OFF` values in the comments.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_ignored_nodes` function:

```python
from typing import Iterator, Optional, List
from leaf import Leaf
from ln import LN
from node import Node, ListComments, FMT_ON, FMT_OFF, container_of

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    is_fmt_on = False
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        comments = ListComments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False)
        for comment in comments:
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
                break
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
                break
        if is_fmt_on:
            return
        yield container
        container = container.next_sibling
```

In the corrected code, I have added the necessary imports and fixed the logic within the `generate_ignored_nodes` function to correctly handle the `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` comments. The `is_fmt_on` variable is now updated based on the presence of the `FMT_ON` and `FMT_OFF` values in the comments, and the function properly iterates through the containers until encountering `# fmt: on`.
