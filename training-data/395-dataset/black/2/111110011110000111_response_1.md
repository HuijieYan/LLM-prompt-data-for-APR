Potential error location: The generate_ignored_nodes function is not correctly handling the comments with # fmt: on and # fmt: off.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The function is not correctly identifying the presence of # fmt: on comment due to incorrect parsing of comments and not handling the block boundaries and decorators properly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use a flag to track whether # fmt: on is encountered within the block and whether it is currently in effect.
2. Enhance the logic to handle parsing multiline comments and their effect on the block of code.
3. Consider refactoring the code to ensure proper handling of block boundaries and decorators while taking into account the effects of formatter commands.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Iterator, Optional
from bla import LN, Leaf, token

FMT_ON = {"# fmt: on"}
FMT_OFF = {"# fmt: off"}

def container_of(leaf: Leaf) -> Optional[LN]:
    # implementation of container_of function
    pass

def list_comments(prefix: str, is_endmarker: bool) -> Iterator:
    # implementation of list_comments function
    pass

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    is_fmt_on = False
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        if is_fmt_on:
            yield container
        container = container.next_sibling
```
