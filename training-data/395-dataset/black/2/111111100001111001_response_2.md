Potential error location: The function is not properly iterating through the comments and checking for `# fmt: on` or `# fmt: off` to determine when to stop generating ignored nodes.

Reason for the bug: The function is not correctly checking for the `# fmt: on` or `# fmt: off` comments to stop generating ignored nodes.

Possible approach to fixing the bug: We should iterate through all the comments of the container node and check for `# fmt: on` or `# fmt: off` comments to determine when to stop generating ignored nodes.

```python
def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.
    
    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix):
            if comment.value == '# fmt: on':
                is_fmt_on = True
                break
            elif comment.value == '# fmt: off':
                is_fmt_on = False
                break
        
        if is_fmt_on:
            return

        yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
