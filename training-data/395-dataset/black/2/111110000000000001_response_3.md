Potential error location: The 'return' statement within the 'for' loop is causing the function to exit prematurely without yielding all the containers.

Reason for the bug: The 'return' statement is incorrectly placed within the 'for' loop. It should be outside the 'while' loop so that the function can yield all the containers before stopping at the end of the block.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Move the 'return' statement outside the 'while' loop so that it only returns after yielding all the containers.

Corrected code:

```python
from typing import Iterator, Optional
from some_module import List, LN, Leaf, token, FMT_ON, FMT_OFF, container_of, list_comments

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        if is_fmt_on:
            break

        yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```
