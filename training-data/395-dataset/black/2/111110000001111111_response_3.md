The buggy function, `generate_ignored_nodes`, is designed to generate all leaves in the container of a given leaf until it encounters `# fmt: on`. However, the function currently has a bug that prevents it from stopping at `# fmt: on` and instead stops at the end of the block.

The potential error location within the function is the `for` loop that iterates through the comments in the container's prefix. The `is_fmt_on` flag is correctly toggled based on the presence of `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` comments, but it is not correctly stopping the generation of ignored nodes as intended.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `is_fmt_on` flag is not being used to break out of the loop and stop the generation of ignored nodes. Instead, it is simply checked once the loop completes, and the function returns, which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, the approach is to use the `is_fmt_on` flag within the `for` loop to break out of the loop as soon as `# fmt: on` is encountered. After breaking out of the loop, the function should stop generating ignored nodes and return.

Below is the corrected code:

```python
from typing import Iterator, Optional
# Import the necessary types from the module

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.
    
    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
                break  # Break out of the loop as soon as # fmt: on is encountered
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        
        if is_fmt_on:
            return  # Stop generating ignored nodes and return
        
        yield container
        container = container.next_sibling
```

With this correction, the function will properly stop generating ignored nodes when encountering `# fmt: on` and will return, fixing the bug.
