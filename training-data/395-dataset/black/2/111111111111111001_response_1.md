Potential error location: The error seems to be related to the formatting of the code as there are differences between the expected and actual outputs. The specific issue might be related to the functionality of the `generate_ignored_nodes` function and how it handles the `# fmt: on` comment.

Reason behind the bug: The `generate_ignored_nodes` function is not correctly processing the `# fmt: on` comment. It is not properly stopping when it encounters `# fmt: on` and is not generating the correct nodes.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Add proper conditions for stopping the generation of nodes when encountering `# fmt: on`.
2. Ensure that the function is properly iterating through the nodes and handling the comments as expected.

```python
from typing import Iterator, List, Optional
from black import Leaf, ProtoComment, LN, token, FMT_ON, FMT_OFF

# corrected function
def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.
    
    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
                break
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        if is_fmt_on:
            return
    
        yield container
    
        container = container.next_sibling
```
