The error is likely occurring in the `generate_ignored_nodes` function, as indicated in the test function's error message. It seems that the function is not properly handling the condition for `# fmt: on`, which is causing the test case to fail.

The reason for the bug is that the `generate_ignored_nodes` function is not correctly checking for the `# fmt: on` directive, and thus it's not stopping at the corresponding block boundary.

To fix this bug, the `generate_ignored_nodes` function should properly handle the `# fmt: on` directive by updating the loop condition based on the presence of this directive. It should also take into account the block boundaries when generating the ignored nodes.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_ignored_nodes` function:

```python
def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.
    
    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        if is_fmt_on:
            break  # Stop the loop when # fmt: on is encountered

        yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```

In the corrected code, when the `# fmt: on` comment is encountered, the loop exits using the `break` statement, which should properly handle the directive. Additionally, the `list_comments` function is called without the `is_endmarker` argument, as it seems unnecessary and may have been causing issues.
