The error occurs because the `generate_ignored_nodes` function is not correctly handling the comments with `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off`. It is not correctly tracking whether the formatter should be turned on or off. This leads to incorrect formatting of the code.

The potential error is within the logic that checks whether the formatter is turned on or off based on the comments. The function iterates through the comments within the container's prefix, but it does not keep track effectively of the state of the formatter.

To fix the bug, the function needs to keep track of the state of the formatter (`is_fmt_on`). It must correctly interpret the `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` comments, and update the state based on these comments.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from typing import Iterator, Optional
from black.node import Leaf, LN

FMT_ON = {"# fmt: on"}
FMT_OFF = {"# fmt: off"}

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    is_fmt_on = True  # Assuming formatter is on initially
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False

        if is_fmt_on:
            yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```

In the corrected version, the state `is_fmt_on` is initialized to `True`. Then the comments are checked and the state is updated accordingly. The `yield container` statement is placed within the `if is_fmt_on` block to ensure that only the nodes within the "formatted" scope are yielded.
