The test case `test_fmtonoff4` is trying to compare the expected output with the actual output using `assertFormatEqual`. The error message indicates that the expected and actual outputs do not match.

The issue might be in the `generate_ignored_nodes` function, which is used to generate leaves until the comment `# fmt: on` is reached. The error message shows differences in the formatting of the output, which could be caused by the function not handling comments and whitespaces properly.

The function may not be properly handling comments and formatting, leading to the observed differences between the expected and actual output.

To fix this, the function should skip over comments and handle the formatting properly to ensure that the expected and actual outputs match.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
from typing import Optional, Iterator

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        if is_fmt_on:
            break  # Terminate the loop if fmt is on

        yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```

In the corrected code, the return statement has been replaced with a break statement to terminate the loop if `# fmt: on` is found. This will allow the function to properly handle comments and formatting while generating the output.
