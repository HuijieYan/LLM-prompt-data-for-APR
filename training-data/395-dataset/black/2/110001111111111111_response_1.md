The issue seems to be related to the `generate_ignored_nodes` function. The function is expected to start from the container of the input `Leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`, and stop at the end of the block. However, the function is not behaving as expected, as it returns too early even when the `# fmt: on` condition is not met.

The reason for this bug could be related to the premature return from the function. The line `return` without any value stops the execution of the function prematurely, preventing the code below from executing.

To fix the bug, we should remove the `return` statement inside the `while` loop and instead set the `is_fmt_on` flag to `True` when the `# fmt: on` condition is met. Then, after the loop, we can use the `is_fmt_on` flag to decide whether to yield the container or not.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_ignored_nodes` function:

```python
def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.
    
    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix):
            if comment.value.startswith("# fmt: on"):
                is_fmt_on = True
                break
        
        if is_fmt_on:
            break
    
        yield container
    
        container = container.next_sibling
```

In this corrected function, we removed the premature `return` statement and replaced it with a `break` statement to exit the loop when the `# fmt: on` condition is met. This allows the loop to complete its iterations and yield the containers as expected.
