The issue seems to be related to the function `generate_ignored_nodes` not properly handling the `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` comments when crossing block boundaries and decorators. The bug causes the formatter commands to not take effect until the end of the block.

The potential error location within the code is the if statement:
```python
if is_fmt_on:
    return
```

The reason behind the bug is that when `is_fmt_on` is True, the function immediately returns without completing the iteration over the container's nodes, causing the formatter commands to not take effect when expected.

To fix the bug, the `is_fmt_on` check should not cause an immediate return, but rather should continue processing the container's nodes until the end of the block is reached.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Iterator, Optional, List
from tokenize import Token

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    ignore_nodes: bool = False
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                ignore_nodes = False
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                ignore_nodes = True
        if not ignore_nodes:
            yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```

In the corrected code, `ignore_nodes` is used to keep track of whether the nodes should be ignored based on the formatter commands. The function continues to iterate over the container's nodes regardless of the `ignore_nodes` status, ensuring that all nodes are processed until the end of the block.
