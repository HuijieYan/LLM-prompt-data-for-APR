The error message from the test function is an AssertionError, indicating that the expected and actual results do not match. The error arises when comparing the expected and actual formatted source code.

The potential error location within the problematic function is within the `generate_ignored_nodes` function. It seems that the function is not correctly generating the ignored nodes until `# fmt: on` is encountered.

The bug likely occurs because the `generate_ignored_nodes` function is not correctly identifying the end of the block when encountering `# fmt: on`. As a result, the expected and actual formatted source codes are not matching.

To fix the bug, the `generate_ignored_nodes` function should properly identify the `# fmt: on` directive and stop the generation of ignored nodes at that point. This can be achieved by updating the logic that checks for the presence of `# fmt: on` and appropriately breaking the loop when it is encountered.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
FMT_ON = {"# fmt: on"}

# Corrected function
def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.
    
    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
                break  # Break the loop when # fmt: on is encountered
        if is_fmt_on:
            break  # Break the loop when # fmt: on is encountered

        yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```

In the corrected code, the loop logic has been updated to properly break when `# fmt: on` directive is encountered, ensuring that the ignored nodes are generated until that point. This should address the bug and resolve the AssertionError during the test.
