The error is likely to occur in the `generate_ignored_nodes` function. This function is designed to yield a sequence of nodes, starting from a given `Leaf` and continuing up to a particular comment value `# fmt: on`. However, the implementation seems incorrect, as it does not properly check for the presence of `# fmt: on` comments within the containers.

The provided error message seems to point to a failure in matching the expected and actual output of the functionality. This indicates a discrepancy between the intended behavior and the actual output of the `generate_ignored_nodes` function.

The bug likely arises from mishandling the comments in the listed `container` while iterating over the comments. As part of the correction, it is crucial to properly iterate through the comments and break out of the loop upon finding `# fmt: on`. Additionally, the `List[ProtoComment]` return type of the `list_comments` function hints at the presence of a list of comments, which should be handled in the `generate_ignored_nodes` function to identify `# fmt: on` properly.

To fix this bug, the function `generate_ignored_nodes` needs to be adjusted to correctly handle comments and halt the generation when encountering `# fmt: on`. Below is the corrected implementation of the method:

```python
def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False

        # Fetch the comments
        comments = list_comments(container.prefix)  # Assuming this function returns List[ProtoComment]

        for comment in comments:
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
                break  # Break loop upon finding # fmt: on
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False

        if is_fmt_on:
            return
        yield container
        container = container.next_sibling
```

These changes involve properly iterating over the container and its comments to identify the presence of `# fmt: on` correctly and halting the generation when encountered. This corrected implementation should address the issues described in the error message and the GitHub issue.
