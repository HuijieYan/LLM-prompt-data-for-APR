The error message indicates that the `assertFormatEqual` method of the `BlackTestCase` class is failing due to a mismatch between the expected and actual results. The error points to a discrepancy in formatting and code structure.

The potential error location within the `generate_ignored_nodes` function could be the `if is_fmt_on` line, where the function is supposed to stop generating nodes when the `# fmt: on` command is encountered.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the conditional check for `is_fmt_on` is not properly handling the `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` commands within the code. The function is not correctly recognizing when to stop generating nodes based on the presence of these commands in the code structure.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could involve revisiting the logic within the `generate_ignored_nodes` function to properly handle the `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` commands. This may involve modifying the conditional check for `is_fmt_on` and ensuring that the function stops generating nodes when encountering the `# fmt: on` command.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `generate_ignored_nodes`:

```python
def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        if is_fmt_on:
            break  # Stop generating nodes when encountering # fmt: on

        yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```

In the corrected code, the `if is_fmt_on` condition has been replaced with a `break` statement to stop generating nodes when encountering the `# fmt: on` command. This change ensures that the function behaves as expected when encountering formatter commands within the code.
