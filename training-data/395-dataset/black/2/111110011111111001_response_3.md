The error seems to be a result of the function `generate_ignored_nodes` not correctly handling the comments with `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off`. The function should generate all the leaves until it encounters `# fmt: on`, stopping at the end of the block. 

The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic corresponding to the detection of `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` comments.

The bug occurs because the function incorrectly handles the logic to stop generating leaves when encountering `# fmt: on`. As a result, it does not stop at the appropriate point, leading to incorrect output and assertion failure in the test case.

The possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Checking if `# fmt: on` is encountered before yielding the container.
2. Changing the logic of `is_fmt_on` and managing its value based on the presence of `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` comments.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_ignored_nodes` function:

```python
def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
                break  # Stop iteration when # fmt: on is encountered
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        if is_fmt_on:
            break  # Stop iterating when # fmt: on is encountered

        yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```

In the corrected code:
- When `# fmt: on` is encountered, the function breaks the iteration using the `break` statement.
- When `# fmt: on` is encountered, the function breaks the iteration using the `break` statement.

This logically fixes the bug and ensures the function behaves according to the intended functionality.
