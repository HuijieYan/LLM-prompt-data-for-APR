The test case `test_fmtonoff4` fails with an AssertionError indicating a mismatch between the expected and actual values. The error message highlights the differences between the expected and actual formatted code.

The potential error location within the `generate_ignored_nodes` function is the logic that determines the end of the block using `is_fmt_on` variable and the `yield` statement. It seems that the function is not properly handling the `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` comments.

The bug occurs because the logic for parsing the comments is not accurately identifying the `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` comments and toggling the `is_fmt_on` variable accordingly. As a result, the function does not stop at the correct point in the AST (Abstract Syntax Tree) structure.

To fix this issue, the function needs to correctly identify and handle the `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` comments. Additionally, the function should properly iterate through the AST nodes and yield the correct result based on the container's status.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_ignored_nodes` function:

```python
from typing import Iterator, Optional
from tokenize import TokenInfo

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    FMT_ON = ['# fmt: on']
    FMT_OFF = ['# fmt: off']
    
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        if is_fmt_on:
            break

        yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```

This fix improves the handling of `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` comments and ensures that the function iterates through the nodes correctly to yield the expected result.
