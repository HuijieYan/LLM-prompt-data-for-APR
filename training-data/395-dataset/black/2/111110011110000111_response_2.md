The error message from the test function indicates a failed assertion: `self.assertFormatEqual(expected, actual)`. The test fails because the expected and actual outputs do not match.

The bug is within the `generate_ignored_nodes` function. The loop doesn't correctly check for `# fmt: on` comments that should affect the ignoring of nodes. This is causing the incorrect formatting of the actual output, leading to the test failure.

The bug occurs because the function does not correctly handle the `# fmt: on` comments. As a result, the formatting behavior influenced by these comments is not as expected.

To fix the bug, the `generate_ignored_nodes` function should properly handle the `# fmt: on` comments to determine whether to yield the container. Additionally, it should account for code blocks and decorators that are influenced by these comments.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_ignored_nodes` function:

```python
from typing import Optional, Iterator

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
                yield container  # Yield when # fmt: on is encountered
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        if is_fmt_on:  # If # fmt: on is encountered
            container = container.next_sibling
            continue  # Skip the rest of the loop
        else:
            container = container.next_sibling
```

In the corrected code, when `# fmt: on` is encountered, it yields the container and skips the rest of the loop, allowing proper handling of the formatting behavior.
