Potential error location:
The issue seems to be related to the loop inside the `generate_ignored_nodes` function. Specifically, the condition to check `if is_fmt_on` doesn't seem to be working as expected.

Reasons behind the bug:
The bug occurs because the loop inside the `generate_ignored_nodes` function checks for `is_fmt_on` and immediately returns from the function, preventing the continuation of the loop. This behavior causes the function to stop prematurely, leading to incorrect results.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the condition `if is_fmt_on:` should not directly return from the function. Instead, it should set a flag to break out of the loop. This will allow the loop to continue iterating and generating the ignored nodes until the specified condition is met.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Optional, Iterator
from black import Leaf, LN, list_comments, ProtoComment, FMT_ON, FMT_OFF

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
                break  # Exit the loop if # fmt: on is found
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        if is_fmt_on:
            break  # Exit the loop if # fmt: on is found

        yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```
