The error message from the test function indicates a mismatch between the expected and actual output. Specifically, the `assertFormatEqual` method is failing, and it seems to be related to source formatting differences.

Upon analyzing the buggy function, it can be seen that the function `generate_ignored_nodes` is intended to process and generate leaves until a certain condition is met. However, the implementation of the loop and conditional checks within the function can lead to unexpected termination or incorrect results.

The bug in the initial implementation is related to the misuse of the `while` loop and the incorrect handling of the `container` and associated comments. The loop does not properly iterate through the container and handle the comments that are relevant to determining the termination point.

To fix this bug, the `generate_ignored_nodes` function should be corrected to ensure proper iteration over the container and correct handling of the comments until the specified termination condition is met. This involves modifying the loop and condition checks to correctly process the comments and the state of `is_fmt_on`.

Here's the corrected implementation of the `generate_ignored_nodes` function:

```python
from typing import Iterator, Optional

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.
    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        if is_fmt_on:
            # Move to the next container
            container = container.next_sibling
        else:
            # Generate the container as part of the ignored nodes
            yield container
            container = container.next_sibling
```

In this corrected version, the loop is appropriately modified to process comments and the state of `is_fmt_on` accurately. This ensures correct iteration and generation of the ignored nodes until the desired termination condition is met.
