Potential Error Location:
The potential error is in the for loop where it checks for the comment value in the FMT_ON and FMT_OFF lists. If the comment value is not found in either list, the is_fmt_on flag will remain unchanged, leading to incorrect behavior.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because the is_fmt_on flag is not being updated correctly. If a comment is not found in either FMT_ON or FMT_OFF, the flag remains unchanged, and this can lead to incorrect stopping conditions for the loop.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the is_fmt_on flag outside of the for loop based on the comments found in the container's prefix.
2. Use a break statement inside the for loop to exit the loop once the comment value is found in either FMT_ON or FMT_OFF lists.

Corrected Code:
```python
def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
                break  # Exit the loop if fmt:on is found
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
                break  # Exit the loop if fmt:off is found

        if is_fmt_on:
            return

        yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
