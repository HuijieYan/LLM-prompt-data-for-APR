The potential error in the function is that the variable `is_fmt_on` is never updated within the `while` loop. This means that the function will return None on the first iteration of the loop because `is_fmt_on` is initialized as False and is never updated.

To fix this bug, the variable `is_fmt_on` should be updated based on the comments found in the container's prefix. Additionally, the return statement within the while loop should be replaced with a break statement to stop the loop when `is_fmt_on` becomes True.

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
from typing import Iterator, Optional

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        if is_fmt_on:
            break

        yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```

In the corrected code, the `return` statement has been replaced with a `break` statement to exit the while loop when `is_fmt_on` becomes True. This will ensure that all ignored nodes are generated until the `# fmt: on` is encountered. Additionally, the function now correctly updates the `is_fmt_on` variable based on the comments found in the container's prefix.
