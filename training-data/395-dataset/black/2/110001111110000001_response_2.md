The error message is an assertion error from the test function `test_fmtonoff4` in `test_black.py`. It seems to be comparing the expected result with the actual result and finding differences related to formatting and line breaks.

The `generate_ignored_nodes` function is the buggy function. The error in the function is that it is not properly handling the `comment.value` properly, and the `is_fmt_on` variable is not being updated correctly.

The bug in this code might be caused because `list_comments` is being called within a loop, and it's not clear whether the `list_comments` function returns all comments or only ones that are not end markers. Consequently, the `is_fmt_on` might not be getting correctly set based on `FMT_ON` and `FMT_OFF` values, leading to the wrong return statement.

To fix the bug, the function `list_comments` could be modified to return all comments related to the container, and the logic within the `generate_ignored_nodes` function could be adjusted to properly update `is_fmt_on` based on the result of `list_comments`.

The corrected code for the `generate_ignored_nodes` function is as follows:

```python
from typing import Iterator, Optional
from black import Leaf, LN, List, ProtoComment


# relative function's signature in this file
def container_of(leaf: Leaf) -> LN:
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def list_comments(prefix: str, is_endmarker: bool) -> List[ProtoComment]:
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass


def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        comments = list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False)
        for comment in comments:
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        if is_fmt_on:
            break

        yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```

By updating the logic related to `list_comments` and `is_fmt_on`, and properly setting the end condition, the bug should be resolved.
