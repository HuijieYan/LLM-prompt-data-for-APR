The bug in the code is that the function `generate_ignored_nodes` is not correctly handling the `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` comments. It is supposed to generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`, but it's not working as expected when crossing block boundaries and decorators.

The root cause of the bug seems to be in the checking of `is_fmt_on`. The code iterates over all comments in the prefix and sets `is_fmt_on` based on the last comment processed, which is incorrect. It should instead check all the comments and set `is_fmt_on` based on the combined effect of all comments. Additionally, the code is returning `None` when `is_fmt_on` is True, but it should continue iterating through the container.

To fix this bug, we need to make the following changes:
1. Instead of breaking the loop and returning when `is_fmt_on` is True, we should continue iterating through the container.
2. We should correctly set `is_fmt_on` based on the combined effect of all comments in the prefix.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_ignored_nodes` function:

```python
from typing import Optional, Iterator
from ast import Node, Leaf
from comments import list_comments

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[Node]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    FMT_ON = "# fmt: on"
    FMT_OFF = "# fmt: off"
    
    container: Optional[Node] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        
        if not is_fmt_on:
            yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```

With these changes, the `generate_ignored_nodes` function should now correctly handle the `# fmt: on` and `# fmt: off` comments and continue iterating through the container until `# fmt: on` is encountered.
