The test case `test_fmtonoff4` calls the function `fs(source)` and attempts to assert the equality of the expected and actual output using `self.assertFormatEqual(expected, actual)`. However, this assertion fails due to a mismatch between the expected and actual outputs.

The function `generate_ignored_nodes` is supposed to generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`, but it seems to have multiple issues. The loop that checks for `# fmt: on` comments seems to be returning prematurely with a `return` statement, which could cause it to never reach the intended end result. Additionally, the conditions for checking `is_fmt_on` and updating it might also be incorrect.

The reason behind the bug is that the logic for checking and updating `is_fmt_on` might not be correctly handling the comments and their values, leading to inaccurate results and premature termination of the generation process.

To fix the bug, the logic for checking comments and the `# fmt: on` condition needs to be revised to ensure that it accurately identifies the end marker and continues the generation process accordingly.

Below is the corrected code for the `generate_ignored_nodes` function.

```python
from typing import Iterator, Optional, List
from some_module import Leaf, LN, ProtoComment

FMT_ON = ["# fmt: on"]  # Assuming FMT_ON and FMT_OFF are predefined lists
FMT_OFF = ["# fmt: off"]

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        if is_fmt_on:
            break

        yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```

Please note that the `list_comments` function signature has been updated to remove the `prefix` and `is_endmarker` arguments, assuming that those are not required for the functionality correctly. If they are required, they should be appropriately handled within the `list_comments` function and its usage.
