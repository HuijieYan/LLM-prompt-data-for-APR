Potential Error Location: The issue seems to be with the `list_comments` function being called with an extra argument `is_endmarker=False` which is not defined in the function signature.

Reason for the Bug: The `list_comments` function is being called with an unsupported argument `is_endmarker=False`, which is not defined in the function signature. This is likely leading to an error.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: Remove the unsupported argument `is_endmarker=False` from the `list_comments` function call.

Corrected Code:
```python
def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        if is_fmt_on:
            return

        yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```
