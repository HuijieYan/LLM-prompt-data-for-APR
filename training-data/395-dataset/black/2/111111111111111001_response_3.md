The error message from the test function is an assertion error raised in the `assertFormatEqual` method. The error message indicates a mismatch between the expected and actual results. It provides the specific differences between the expected and actual strings. This suggests that the `fs` function, which is most likely called to produce the `actual` result, is not generating the expected output.

Upon reviewing the buggy function `generate_ignored_nodes`, it seems that the bug lies in the loop iteration for parsing comments. The iteration does not handle the case where `FMT_ON` is encountered and does not update the `is_fmt_on` flag properly, leading to premature termination of the function.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to correctly handle the `FMT_ON` condition and ensure that the `is_fmt_on` flag is appropriately updated. This can be achieved by modifying the loop that iterates through the comments to properly update the flag.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.
    
    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != token.ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        if is_fmt_on:
            break
    
        yield container
    
        container = container.next_sibling
```
