The error message is indicating an assertion error in the `assertFormatEqual` function of the test_fmtonoff4 test case. The assertion error is occurring when comparing the expected and actual outputs. It is failing due to a difference in the formatting of the two outputs.

The potential error location within the generate_ignored_nodes function is the condition for stopping the yield when is_fmt_on is True. It seems that the function is not correctly handling the conditions for generating the ignored nodes and stopping at the end of the block.

The reason behind the bug might be that the function is not properly handling the comments and stopping at the correct point. It is not effectively checking for the `# fmt: on` condition and stopping the yield.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to properly iterate through the nodes and comments while checking for the `# fmt: on` condition. If the condition is met, then the function should stop the yield. Additionally, ensuring that the function stops at the end of the block as intended.

```python
from typing import Optional, Iterator
from comment import list_comments  # assuming list_comments is imported from a module
from token import ENDMARKER
from leaf import Leaf, LN

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        if is_fmt_on:
            break  # stop the yield and exit the loop

        yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```
