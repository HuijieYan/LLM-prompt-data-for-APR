The potential error in the given code is that the `is_fmt_on` variable is not being updated correctly within the `for` loop. This causes the function to return prematurely before yielding all the required nodes.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `is_fmt_on` variable is not being updated correctly when iterating through the comments.

To fix this bug, the `is_fmt_on` variable needs to be updated correctly when iterating through the comments. We should use an `if-else` condition to correctly update the `is_fmt_on` variable based on the comment values.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
from typing import Iterator, Optional
from tokenize import ENDMARKER

def generate_ignored_nodes(leaf: Leaf) -> Iterator[LN]:
    """Starting from the container of `leaf`, generate all leaves until `# fmt: on`.

    Stops at the end of the block.
    """
    container: Optional[LN] = container_of(leaf)
    while container is not None and container.type != ENDMARKER:
        is_fmt_on = False
        for comment in list_comments(container.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
            if comment.value in FMT_ON:
                is_fmt_on = True
            elif comment.value in FMT_OFF:
                is_fmt_on = False
        
        if not is_fmt_on:
            yield container

        container = container.next_sibling
```

In this corrected code, the `is_fmt_on` variable is being updated correctly based on the comment values. This allows the function to yield all the required nodes until `# fmt: on` and stop at the end of the block.
