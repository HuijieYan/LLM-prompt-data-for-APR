Potential error location:
The potential error occurs when trying to call `child.resolve().relative_to(root)` because the `child` variable is a MagicMock object and not an actual Path object.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `child` variable is a MagicMock object, likely because it is being mocked in a test case. This means that the `resolve()` and `relative_to()` methods cannot be called on it, leading to the error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the test case to use actual Path objects instead of MagicMock objects for the `child` variable.
2. If modifying the test case is not possible, consider creating a new Path object with a specified path and using that instead of the MagicMock object in the test case.

Corrected code:
```python
from pathlib import Path

def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        if not isinstance(child, Path):
            child = Path(child)  # create a Path object from the MagicMock
        normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
        if child.is_dir():
            normalized_path += "/"
        exclude_match = exclude.search(normalized_path)
        if exclude_match and exclude_match.group(0):
            report.path_ignored(child, f"matches the --exclude regular expression")
            continue

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```
