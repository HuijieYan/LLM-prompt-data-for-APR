The error occurs in the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function on line 2942, where the resolved path of the files is made relative to the root directory. The bug happens when the resolved path is outside of the root directory, which is not handled correctly.

The reason for this bug is that when a file or directory is a symbolic link to a resource outside of the root directory, the `child.resolve().relative_to(root)` call raises a `ValueError` since the resolved path of the symlinked resource is not within the root directory. This causes the function to crash.

One way to fix this bug is to catch the `ValueError` when attempting to construct the normalized path, and if it's due to a symbolic link, skip the processing for that link and continue the iteration as if it wasn't there.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Pattern, Iterator

def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        try:
            normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
        except ValueError:
            if child.is_symlink():
                continue  # Skip symlinked resources outside of the root directory
            else:
                raise

        if child.is_dir():
            normalized_path += "/"
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)
        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```

With this fix, the function will catch the `ValueError` when attempting to resolve the symlinked resource path, and if it's due to a symbolic link outside of the root directory, it will skip the processing for that link and continue the iteration.
