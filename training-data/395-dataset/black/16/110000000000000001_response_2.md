The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of `root` being absolute. The issue is with the assertion `root.is_absolute()`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `root` path may not always be absolute, leading to the assertion error.

To fix the bug, we can modify the code to handle both absolute and relative paths for `root` by removing the assertion and directly using the `root` path.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Pattern, Iterator
from pathlib import Path

def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    for child in path.iterdir():
        normalized_path = child.resolve().as_posix()
        if child.is_dir():
            normalized_path += "/"
        exclude_match = exclude.search(normalized_path)
        if exclude_match and exclude_match.group(0):
            report.path_ignored(child, f"matches the --exclude regular expression")
            continue

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, include, exclude, report)

        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```
In the corrected code, the `root` parameter is removed as it was not necessary. The function now only takes `path`, `include`, `exclude`, and `report` as parameters. The usage of `root` has been replaced with direct path operations on `child`. The assertion related to `root` being absolute has been removed.
