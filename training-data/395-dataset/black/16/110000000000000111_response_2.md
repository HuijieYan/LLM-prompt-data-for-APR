The bug occurs in the gen_python_files_in_dir function on line 2942, where it attempts to make the resolved path of the files relative to the root directory. This causes an error when the file is outside of the root directory, such as in the case of a symbolic link.

One possible approach to fixing this bug is to handle this specific case by checking if the child is a symlink and skipping it if it is. This can be achieved by adding a try-except block to catch the ValueError and check if the child is a symlink. If it is, the function can continue to the next iteration without raising an error.

Here's the corrected code for the gen_python_files_in_dir function:

```python
from typing import Pattern, Iterator
from pathlib import Path

def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        try:
            normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
        except ValueError:
            if child.is_symlink():
                continue

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```

With this correction, the function will handle symbolic links pointing to resources outside of the root directory without raising an error.
