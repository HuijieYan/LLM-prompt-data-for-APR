The potential error in the function is that the `report` object is used incorrectly. The function is attempting to call `report.path_ignored` but it should be using `report.path_ignored` instead. Also, the usage of `path` as "/Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/black_16/black.py" seems incorrect. 

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is incorrect method usage and the incorrect setting of the path variable.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to use the `report.path_ignored` method properly and also fix the path variable usage.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Pattern, Iterator

class Report:
    def path_ignored(self, path: Path, message: str) -> None:
        # implementation of path_ignored method
        pass

def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: Report,
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
        if child.is_dir():
            normalized_path += "/"
        exclude_match = exclude.search(normalized_path)
        if exclude_match and exclude_match.group(0):
            report.path_ignored(child, f"matches the --exclude regular expression")
            continue

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```
