The bug occurs in the function `gen_python_files_in_dir` at line 2942, where it tries to make the resolved path of the files relative to the root directory. This causes an error when the file is outside of the root directory, such as when there is a symbolic link pointing to a file or directory outside of the root directory.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to ignore this case and not handle symlinked resources. We can achieve this by adding a try-except block and continuing if a `ValueError` is raised, indicating that the file is outside of the root directory.

Here is the corrected code for the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function:

```python
from typing import Iterator, Pattern
from pathlib import Path
import re

class Report:
    def __init__(self, check: bool, quiet: bool, verbose: bool, change_count: int, same_count: int, failure_count: int):
        self.check = check
        self.quiet = quiet
        self.verbose = verbose
        self.change_count = change_count
        self.same_count = same_count
        self.failure_count = failure_count
    
    def path_ignored(self, path: Path, message: str):
        if not self.quiet:
            print(message)

def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: Report,
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    try:
        normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
    except ValueError:
        if child.is_symlink():
            return  # ignore symlinked resources
        else:
            raise
    else:
        if child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
        elif child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

# Usage
root = Path('/Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/black_16/tests')
path = Path('/Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/black_16/tests')
include_pattern = re.compile('\\.pyi?$')
exclude_pattern = re.compile('/(\\.git')
report = Report(check=False, quiet=False, verbose=False, change_count=0, same_count=0, failure_count=0)

files_generator = gen_python_files_in_dir(path, root, include_pattern, exclude_pattern, report)
for file in files_generator:
    print(file)
```

In the corrected code, we added a try-except block to handle the `ValueError` that occurs when the file is outside of the root directory. If a `ValueError` is raised, we check if the `child` is a symlink and continue if it is. Otherwise, we raise the error. This handling ensures that symlinked resources are ignored, addressing the bug where the function crashes when encountering a symlink pointing outside of the root directory.
