The error occurs when the `relative_to` method is called in the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function. The `relative_to` method is being used to find the relative path of the current file from the root directory. However, when `child.resolve().relative_to(root)` is called, it raises a `ValueError` because the `child.resolve()` path does not start with the `root` path.

The root cause of the bug is that the path resolution occurs before relative path conversion, leading to the incorrect path comparisons.

To fix this issue, the correct approach is to use the `relative_to` method directly on the `path` object rather than on the resolved path of the child. This ensures that the comparison is between two paths in the correct form.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
from typing import Iterator, Pattern
from pathlib import Path

def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)
        elif child.is_file():
            normalized_path = "/" + child.relative_to(root).as_posix()
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
            else:
                exclude_match = exclude.search(normalized_path)
                if exclude_match and exclude_match.group(0):
                    report.path_ignored(child, f"matches the --exclude regular expression")
```

This corrected function directly uses `child.relative_to(root)` to calculate the relative path from the root directory for comparison, ensuring that the comparison is accurate and does not result in a `ValueError`.
