The potential error in the provided function is due to the use of a MagicMock object for the `path.iterdir` and `child` variables, instead of actual `Path` objects. This could be an issue if the MagicMock object does not behave as expected when the function is called with real file path arguments.

To fix the bug:
- Replace the MagicMock objects for `path.iterdir` and `child` with actual `Path` objects.
- Ensure that the code handles the cases where `child` is a directory or a file appropriately.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
from typing import Pattern, Iterator
from pathlib import Path

class Report:
    def path_ignored(self, path: Path, message: str) -> None:
        pass

def gen_python_files_in_dir(
        path: Path,
        root: Path,
        include: Pattern[str],
        exclude: Pattern[str],
        report: Report
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
        if child.is_dir():
            normalized_path += "/"
        exclude_match = exclude.search(normalized_path)
        if exclude_match and exclude_match.group(0):
            report.path_ignored(child, f"matches the --exclude regular expression")
            continue

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```

In this corrected function, the MagicMock objects for `path.iterdir` and `child` have been replaced by actual `Path` objects. Additionally, the `report` parameter has been replaced with a mocked `Report` class for completeness. This should resolve the issues caused by the usage of MagicMock objects and ensure the function operates correctly with real file path arguments.
