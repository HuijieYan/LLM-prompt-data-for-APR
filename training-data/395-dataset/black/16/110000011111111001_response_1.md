The error "ValueError: '/a/b/c' does not start with '/Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/black_16/tests'" indicates that the `normalized_path` variable in the function `gen_python_files_in_dir` is being generated incorrectly. The issue seems to be related to resolving the path relative to `root`.

The bug occurs because the `resolve` method is being used incorrectly or inappropriately in the context of the `child` path. The `resolve` method in the `pathlib` library is used to resolve the absolute path of a specified file. When the `resolve` method is applied to `child`, which is a MagicMock object in this case, it produces a different relative path than expected.

To fix the bug:
1. Check if the `resolve` method is called on a MagicMock object erroneously. If so, it needs to be replaced with a valid path to resolve its absolute path correctly.
2. Ensure that `normalized_path` is correctly derived from the resolved path to be relative to `root`.
3. Handle the case where `child` is a symbolic link or a strange file with an improperly resolved path.

The corrected code for the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function:

```python
# Corrected function
from typing import Iterator, Pattern
from pathlib import Path

def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)
        elif child.is_file():
            child_path = child.resolve()
            if child_path.is_absolute():
                try:
                    relative_path = child_path.relative_to(root)
                    normalized_path = relative_path.as_posix()
                    include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
                    exclude_match = exclude.search(normalized_path)
                    if include_match and not exclude_match:
                        yield child
                except ValueError:
                    report.path_ignored(child, f"ValueError: could not determine the relative path")
            else:
                report.path_ignored(child, f"Child path is not absolute")        
```

This corrected code makes sure to handle the resolution of the `child` path correctly and then derives the relative path to `root` before checking if it matches the `include` and `exclude` patterns. Additionally, it includes a handling mechanism for cases where the path resolution or relative path generation might raise a `ValueError`.
