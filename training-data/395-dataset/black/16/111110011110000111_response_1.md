The test case `test_symlink_out_of_root_directory` involves preparing mock arguments and setting the behavior of the mock arguments to mimic a symlink that resolves outside of the root directory. The `gen_python_files_in_dir` function is then called, and the error occurs when trying to get the relative path of the resolved symlink.

The error is occurring because the function attempts to calculate the relative path from the resolved symlink path to the root directory, and if the resolved symlink path is outside the root directory, a `ValueError` is raised.

To fix this issue, we can modify the function to handle the case where the resolved path of the file is outside the root directory without raising a `ValueError`. Instead, it can simply continue and ignore such cases.

Here's the corrected code for the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function:

```python
from typing import Pattern, Iterator
from pathlib import Path

def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
        if child.is_symlink() and not str(child.resolve()).startswith(str(root)):
            continue
        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)
        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```

In the corrected code, we added a conditional check to skip the resolved symlink path that is outside the root directory. This check involves calling `child.is_symlink()` to determine if the current path is a symbolic link, and then using the `resolve()` method to get the resolved path and checking if it starts with the root directory. If it doesn't, the loop continues to the next iteration without raising a `ValueError`.


This modification allows the function to handle symbolic links that point to resources outside the root directory without crashing.
