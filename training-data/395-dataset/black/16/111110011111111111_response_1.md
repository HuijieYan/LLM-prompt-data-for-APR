The error occurs in this line of the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function:
```python
normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
```
The error message indicates that the resolved path of the files is made relative to the root directory, and it's impossible when the file is outside of the root directory. This situation occurs because the function does not handle the case where the resolved path of the file is outside of the root directory.

To fix the bug, we can add a try-except block to handle the case where the resolved path of the file is outside of the root directory. If the file is a symlink, we can simply continue to the next iteration, as suggested in the GitHub issue description. If the file is not a symlink and the resolved path is outside of the root directory, a ValueError should not be raised to avoid crashing the program.

Here's the corrected `gen_python_files_in_dir` function:

```python
def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        try:
            normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
        except ValueError:
            if child.is_symlink():
                continue
            else:
                raise
        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)
        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```

By implementing this try-except block, the function will handle the case where the resolved path of the file is outside of the root directory without crashing the program.
