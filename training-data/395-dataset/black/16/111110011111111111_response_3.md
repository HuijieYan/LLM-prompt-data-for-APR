The error is occurring when the function attempts to make the resolved path of a file relative to the root directory. This is causing a ValueError when the resolved path is clearly outside of the root directory.

The issue occurs because the function `normalize_path` attempts to make the resolved path relative to the root directory, which raises a ValueError if the resolved path is not within the root directory.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `normalize_path` function so that it handles cases where the resolved path is outside of the root directory, particularly in the case where the child is a symbolic link.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        if child.is_symlink() and not child.resolve().relative_to(root):
            # skip symbolic links that point outside of the root directory
            continue
        normalized_path = "/" + child.relative_to(root).as_posix()
        if child.is_dir():
            normalized_path += "/"
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)
        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```

In the modified version, we added a check for symbolic links using the `is_symlink()` method. If the child is a symbolic link and its resolved path is not inside the root directory, we skip it. Additionally, we modified how `normalized_path` is created to address the ValueError issue.
