Upon analyzing the given issue description, it is apparent that the bug is caused by the attempt to resolve the path of a symlinked file or directory outside of the root directory. This results in a ValueError because the resolved path does not start with the root.

The error occurs at line 2942 of the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function, where the resolved path of the files is made relative to the root directory. This becomes impossible if the file is outside of the root directory, as is the case with symbolic links.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to handle symlinked resources. If the child is a symlink, we can simply continue to the next iteration without attempting to resolve the path relative to the root. 

Here is the corrected code for the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function:

```python
def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        if child.is_symlink():
            continue
            
        normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()

        if child.is_dir():
            normalized_path += "/"

        exclude_match = exclude.search(normalized_path)
        if exclude_match and exclude_match.group(0):
            report.path_ignored(child, f"matches the --exclude regular expression")
            continue

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```

In the corrected code, we added a check for symlinked resources. If the child is a symlink, the iteration continues to the next child without attempting to resolve the path relative to the root, thus avoiding the ValueError.
