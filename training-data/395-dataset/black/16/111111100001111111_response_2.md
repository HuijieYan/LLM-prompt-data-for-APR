The issue occurs when the function tries to resolve the path for a symbolic link that points to a file or directory outside of the root directory. This results in a ValueError as the resolved path cannot be made relative to the root directory in such cases.

To fix this issue, we can modify the function to ignore the case when a symbolic link points to a resource outside of the root directory. Instead of trying to resolve the path and make it relative to the root directory, we can simply continue to the next iteration in the loop when a symbolic link is encountered.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Iterator, Pattern
from pathlib import Path

class Report:
    def path_ignored(self, path: Path, message: str) -> None:
        # Implementation of path_ignored method
        pass

def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: Report,
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        normalized_path = "/" + child.as_posix()
        if child.is_dir():
            normalized_path += "/"
        if child.is_symlink():
            continue  # Skip symbolic links pointing outside the root directory

        exclude_match = exclude.search(normalized_path)
        if exclude_match and exclude_match.group(0):
            report.path_ignored(child, f"matches the --exclude regular expression")
            continue

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)
        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```

In the corrected code, we added a check for symbolic links using `child.is_symlink()` and continue to the next iteration in the loop if a symbolic link is encountered. This prevents the function from trying to resolve the path for symbolic links pointing outside the root directory, thus avoiding the ValueError.
