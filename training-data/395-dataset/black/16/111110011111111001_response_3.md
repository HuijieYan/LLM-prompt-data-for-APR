The error occurred at this line of the function:
```python
normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
```
The error message indicates that the `relative_to` method is trying to find the relative path of `child` with respect to `root`, but it is failing because the `child` path does not start with the `root` path. The `relative_to` method raises a ValueError in this case.

It seems that the `child` path is being resolved relative to a root path, and then the relative path of the resolved `child` path is being calculated with respect to the `root`. However, it appears that the intention might be to calculate the relative path of the `child` path with respect to the `path` parameter of the function.

To fix this, the line that causes the error should be updated to use `path` instead of `root` as the base for calculating the relative path:
```python
normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(path).as_posix()
```

Here's the corrected function/method:
```python
import re
from pathlib import Path
from types import PatternType
import black

class Report:
    def path_ignored(self, path, message):
        pass

def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    include: PatternType,
    exclude: PatternType,
    report: "Report"
) -> Path:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    for child in path.iterdir():
        normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(path).as_posix()
        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, include, exclude, report)

        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```
