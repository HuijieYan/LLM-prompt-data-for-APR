The error occurs at the line `normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()` in the function `gen_python_files_in_dir`. The error message indicates that there is a ValueError because the resolved path of the file is made relative to the root directory, and this is impossible if the file is outside of the root directory. Additionally, the test function `test_symlink_out_of_root_directory` prepares a behavior for `child` as a symlink with a resolved path outside of the root directory, which triggers the error.

The possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Adding a check to handle the case when the resolved path of the file is outside of the root directory. This may involve catching the ValueError and continuing the loop if the child is a symlink.
2. Modifying the behavior of the mock argument `child` to be within the root directory for the test function `test_symlink_out_of_root_directory`.

Here's the corrected code for the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function:

```python
def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        try:
            normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
        except ValueError:
            if child.is_symlink():
                continue  # Handle symlink with a resolved path outside of the root directory
            else:
                raise  # Re-raise the exception for non-symlink cases

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```

The updated code includes a try-except block to handle the ValueError if the resolved path is outside of the root directory. If the child is a symlink, the loop continues to the next iteration. If the child is not a symlink, the exception is re-raised.
