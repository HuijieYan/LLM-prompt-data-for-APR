The error occurs when the resolved path of a file is made relative to the root directory, and the file is outside of the root directory. This is observed in the test case where a symbolic link points to a file outside of the root directory.

The issue is that the `relative_to` method tries to make the path of the file relative to the root directory, but it fails when the file is outside of the root directory and raises a `ValueError`.

To fix the bug, we can catch the `ValueError` exception and continue if the file is a symbolic link. If the exception is not related to a symbolic link, it should be raised as it might be a different issue.

Here's the corrected code with the fix:

```python
from typing import Pattern, Iterator
from pathlib import Path
import re

class Report:
    # Dummy implementation of the Report class
    pass

def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        try:
            normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
        except ValueError as e:
            if child.is_symlink():
                continue  # Skip symbolic links outside the root directory
            else:
                raise e  # Raise the exception if it's not related to a symbolic link

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)
        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
