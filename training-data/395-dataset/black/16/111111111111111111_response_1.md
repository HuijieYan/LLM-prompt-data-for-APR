The error occurs at line 2942 of the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function where the resolved path of the files is made relative to the root directory. This causes an issue when the file is outside of the root directory.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that when the function resolves the path of the file and attempts to make it relative to the root directory, it throws a ValueError if the file is outside of the root directory.

To fix the bug, we can modify the code to handle the case where the file is outside of the root directory. Instead of raising a ValueError, we can catch the exception and ignore the symlinked resource.

Here's the corrected code for the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function:

```python
def gen_python_files_in_dir(
        path: Path,
        root: Path,
        include: Pattern[str],
        exclude: Pattern[str],
        report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.
    
    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        try:
            normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
        except ValueError:
            if child.is_symlink():
                continue
            else:
                raise

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```

In the corrected code, I added a try-except block to catch the ValueError. If the child is a symlink, the code continues to the next iteration of the loop. Otherwise, for any other errors, the code will raise the exception as before.
