The error indicated by the test case and the error message occurs in the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function of the `black.py` module. The error is related to the `relative_to` method call in the line `normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()`. The error message indicates that the path `'/a/b/c'` does not start with `'/Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/black_16/tests'`, which results in a `ValueError`.

The bug in the code is arising due to the incorrect usage of the `relative_to` method. The `relative_to` method is used to return the relative path to another path identified by the passed arguments. However, in the code, it's being used to create the `normalized_path` variable, which is causing the value mismatch and resulting in the `ValueError`.

To address this issue and fix the bug, the following corrected code is provided:

```python
def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.glob("**/*"):  # Use glob to get all files under the path
        normalized_path = "/" + str(child.relative_to(root))  # Create normalized path
        exclude_match = exclude.search(normalized_path)
        if exclude_match and exclude_match.group(0):
            report.path_ignored(child, f"matches the --exclude regular expression")
            continue

        if child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(str(child))
            if include_match:
                yield child
```

In the corrected code, the `glob` method is used to recursively get all files under the given path. Then, the `normalized_path` is created using the `relative_to` method, followed by handling the include and exclude checks to yield the files appropriately. This approach resolves the issue with the `relative_to` method and provides the expected behavior for the function.
