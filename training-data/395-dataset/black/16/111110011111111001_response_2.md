The test case `test_symlink_out_of_root_directory` is calling the function `gen_python_files_in_dir` with mock objects to simulate the behavior of the function. The first call of the function is expected to return without an error, while the second call is expected to raise a `ValueError`.

The error message indicates that the problem occurs in the line:
```python
normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
```
The error message suggests that the operation `relative_to(root)` is causing a `ValueError` because the root path is not a parent or an ancestor of the resolved path of the `child`.

The possible reason for the bug is that the `relative_to` method is not handling the case where the `root` path is not a parent or ancestor of the resolved path of the `child`. It is trying to calculate the relative path between the two paths without validating their relationship.

To fix this bug, you should use exception handling to catch the `ValueError` while calculating the relative path and handle it gracefully, possibly by ignoring the `child` if it does not belong to the `root` directory.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from typing import Pattern

def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        try:
            normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
            if child.is_dir():
                normalized_path += "/"
            exclude_match = exclude.search(normalized_path)
            if exclude_match and exclude_match.group(0):
                report.path_ignored(child, f"matches the --exclude regular expression")
                continue

            if child.is_dir():
                yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

            elif child.is_file():
                include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
                if include_match:
                    yield child
        except ValueError:
            # `child` does not belong to the `root` directory, ignore it
            report.path_ignored(child, f"does not belong to the `root` directory")
            continue
```

In the corrected function, a `try-except` block is used to catch the `ValueError` that occurs when trying to calculate the relative path. If a `ValueError` is caught, it means the `child` does not belong to the `root` directory, so it is ignored by reporting as such. This modification fixes the bug and ensures the function handles all cases gracefully.
