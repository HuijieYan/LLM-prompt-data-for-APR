The error occurs when the function `gen_python_files_in_dir` tries to make the resolved path of a file relative to the root directory. This is not possible if the file is outside of the root directory, as is the case with symbolic links. As a result, a `ValueError` is raised.

The main issue lies in the line:
```python
normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
```

To fix this, we should handle the case where the resolved path of the file is outside of the root directory. One possible approach is to catch the `ValueError` when attempting to make the resolved path relative to the root directory and ignore the symlinked resource. In this case, the function should continue without raising an error.

Here is the corrected code for the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function:

```python
from typing import Pattern, Iterator
from pathlib import Path
import re
import black   # Assuming the black module is being used

def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        normalized_path = child.resolve().as_posix()
        if child.is_dir():
            normalized_path += "/"
        exclude_match = exclude.search(normalized_path)
        if exclude_match and exclude_match.group(0):
            report.path_ignored(child, f"matches the --exclude regular expression")
            continue

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

        elif child.is_file():
            try:
                relative_path = child.relative_to(root).as_posix()
                include_match = include.search(relative_path)
                if include_match:
                    yield child
            except ValueError:
                if child.is_symlink():
                    continue
                raise

# This code assumes that the black.Report class and other relevant details are available.
```

In the corrected code, we have removed the initial "/" from `normalized_path` and also added a try-except block to handle the `ValueError`. The `ValueError` occurs when the child's resolved path is not relative to the root directory, and in this case, if the child is a symbolic link, we continue without raising an error.

This approach will allow the function to handle symbolic links pointing to resources outside of the root directory without raising a ValueError.
