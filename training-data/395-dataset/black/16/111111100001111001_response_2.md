The error in the function seems to be related to the way the `Path` objects are being handled. This is likely to result in errors due to the way paths are being resolved and tested for various conditions.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the actual `Path` objects instead of MagicMock objects for `path` and `child`.
2. Verify the usage of `child.resolve()` and ensure that it returns a valid `Path` object.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Pattern, Iterator

class Report:
    def __init__(self, check: bool, quiet: bool, verbose: bool, change_count: int, same_count: int, failure_count: int):
        self.check = check
        self.quiet = quiet
        self.verbose = verbose
        self.change_count = change_count
        self.same_count = same_count
        self.failure_count = failure_count
    
    def path_ignored(self, path: Path, message: str) -> None:
        """Code for path_ignored method"""
        pass

def gen_python_files_in_dir(path: Path, root: Path, include: Pattern[str], exclude: Pattern[str], report: Report) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
        if child.is_dir():
            normalized_path += "/"
        exclude_match = exclude.search(normalized_path)
        if exclude_match and exclude_match.group(0):
            report.path_ignored(child, f"matches the --exclude regular expression")
            continue

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```

In the corrected function, we ensure that the `path` and `child` variables are of type `Path`, and we handle the path manipulation in a safer way. Additionally, a sample `Report` class is provided to prevent errors when instantiating the `Report` object.
