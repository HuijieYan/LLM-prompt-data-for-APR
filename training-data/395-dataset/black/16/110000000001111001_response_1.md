The error occurs because the function is trying to call the `is_absolute` method on the `root` variable, which is a `PosixPath` object. This is not how the `is_absolute` method should be used in this context, leading to the error.

To fix this issue, the `is_absolute` method should be used directly on the `path` variable instead of the `root` variable.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Pattern, Iterator

def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert path.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `path` must be absolute but is {path}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(path).as_posix()
        if child.is_dir():
            normalized_path += "/"
        exclude_match = exclude.search(normalized_path)
        if exclude_match and exclude_match.group(0):
            report.path_ignored(child, f"matches the --exclude regular expression")
            continue

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, include, exclude, report)

        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```
