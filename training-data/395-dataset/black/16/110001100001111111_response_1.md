The issue was caused by the function trying to resolve the path of a symlink that points to a resource outside of the root directory. This caused an error because the resolved path couldn't be made relative to the root directory.

To fix this issue, we can modify the function to handle symlinks to resources outside of the root directory by adding a try-except block. If the resolved path cannot be made relative to the root directory, the function should continue without yielding the symlinked file.

Here's the corrected code for the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function:

```python
def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        try:
            normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
        except ValueError:
            if child.is_symlink():
                continue

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```

With this modification, the function will handle symlinks to resources outside of the root directory by ignoring them and continuing with the iteration. This should prevent the crash caused by the original issue.
