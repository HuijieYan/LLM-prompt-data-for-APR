The error occurs on line 2942 of the `black.py` file where the resolved path of the files is being made relative to the root directory. This causes an issue when the file is outside of the root directory, resulting in a `ValueError`.

The problematic function `gen_python_files_in_dir` is attempting to generate all files under a given path while excluding certain patterns defined by `include` and `exclude` regular expressions. The function encounters an issue when dealing with symbolic links pointing to files or directories outside of the root directory.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to handle cases where the child is a symbolic link and its resolved path is outside the root directory. We can modify the logic to skip processing such symbolic links rather than attempting to make their path relative to the root directory.

Here is the corrected code for the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function:

```python
def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: 'Report',
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        if child.is_symlink() and child.resolve().parent != root:
            # Child is a symlink outside of the root directory, skip processing it
            continue

        normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
        if child.is_dir():
            normalized_path += "/"
        exclude_match = exclude.search(normalized_path)
        if exclude_match and exclude_match.group(0):
            report.path_ignored(child, f"matches the --exclude regular expression")
            continue

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```
With this modification, the function will skip processing symbolic links that resolve outside of the root directory, avoiding the `ValueError` that was occurring.
