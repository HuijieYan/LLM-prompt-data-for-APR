The issue described is related to the handling of symbolic links pointing to files or directories outside of the root directory. The error occurs at line 2942 of the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function, where the resolved path of the files is made relative to the root directory. This causes a ValueError when the file is located outside of the root directory.

The root cause of the bug is that the function does not handle symbolic links properly when resolving the path relative to the root directory.

To fix the bug, the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function needs to be modified to handle symbolic links appropriately. When resolving the path of a file or directory, if a ValueError occurs, it means that the item is a symbolic link outside of the root directory. In this case, the function should simply continue to the next item without raising an error.

Here's the corrected code for the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function:

```python
def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        try:
            normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
        except ValueError:
            if child.is_symlink():
                continue  # Skip symbolic links pointing outside of the root directory
            else:
                raise
        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)
        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```

In this corrected code, the `try-except` block is used to handle symbolic links pointing outside of the root directory. If a ValueError occurs, it checks if the item is a symbolic link and continues to the next item without raising an error. This approach addresses the issue described in the bug report.
