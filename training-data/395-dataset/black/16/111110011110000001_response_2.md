The error occurs in the `gen_python_files_in_dir` method when it attempts to resolve the relative path of a directory outside the root directory. This is because the method tries to resolve the path relative to the root directory (`root`) by using the `relative_to` method, which ends up raising a `ValueError`.

The bug is occurring because the `normalized_path` is being calculated incorrectly when the child is a symlink or a file outside the root directory. This causes the `relative_to` comparison to fail, leading to the `ValueError`.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify how the `normalized_path` is calculated when the child is a symlink or a file outside the root directory. Instead of trying to calculate the relative path using `relative_to`, the normalized path can be constructed directly using the appropriate logic to handle symlink paths and paths outside the root directory.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from typing import Pattern, Iterator
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Iterator

def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        if child.is_dir():
            normalized_path = (child / "").resolve().as_posix()
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)
        elif child.is_file():
            normalized_path = child.resolve().as_posix()
            if include.search(normalized_path) and not exclude.search(normalized_path):
                yield child
```

In the corrected function, the normalized path is constructed directly based on whether the child is a directory or a file, avoiding the use of `relative_to` in cases where it could lead to a `ValueError`. This should resolve the issue and prevent the error from occurring in the test case.
