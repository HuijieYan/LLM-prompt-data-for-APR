The error is occurring in the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function at line 2942. The error message indicates that the resolved path of the files is made relative to the root directory, which is impossible if the file is outside of the root directory. This is consistent with the test case that tries to simulate a symlink that resolves to a path outside the root directory.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to handle cases where the resolved path is outside the root directory, such as when dealing with symlinks. Instead of trying to get the relative path to the root directory, we will handle exceptions and continue if the file is a symlink with a resolved path outside the root directory.

Here's the corrected code for the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function:

```python
def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().as_posix()
        if child.is_dir():
            normalized_path += "/"
        exclude_match = exclude.search(normalized_path)
        if exclude_match and exclude_match.group(0):
            report.path_ignored(child, f"matches the --exclude regular expression")
            continue

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```

In this corrected code, we remove the attempt to find the relative path to the root directory and instead use the resolved path directly. We also remove the condition that checks whether the resolved path is a symlink, as we now handle all paths in the same way.

With these changes, the function should be able to handle cases where the resolved path is outside the root directory, such as with symlinks, and continue generating python files without raising errors.
