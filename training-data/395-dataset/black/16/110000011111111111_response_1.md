The error occurs when the function `gen_python_files_in_dir` tries to find the relative path of a child (symlink) which points to a resource outside of the root directory. This is causing a ValueError because the resolved path does not start with the root directory.

To fix this bug, we can add a try-except block to catch the ValueError and continue if the child is a symlink. This will prevent the ValueError from being raised and allow the function to continue processing other files.

Here's the corrected code for the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function:

```python
from pathlib import Path, PurePath
from typing import Iterator, Pattern

def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().as_posix()
        if child.is_dir():
            normalized_path += "/"
        exclude_match = exclude.search(normalized_path)
        if exclude_match and exclude_match.group(0):
            report.path_ignored(child, f"matches the --exclude regular expression")
            continue

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

        elif child.is_file():
            try:
                relative_path = child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
                include_match = include.search(relative_path)
                if include_match:
                    yield child
            except ValueError:
                if child.is_symlink():
                    continue  # ignore symlink pointing outside of the root
                else:
                    raise
```

With this fix, the function will catch the ValueError when resolving the relative path and continue processing other files if the child is a symlink pointing outside of the root.

This fix should address the issue described in the bug report and prevent the ValueError from being raised in the described scenario.
