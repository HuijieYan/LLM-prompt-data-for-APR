The error in the given function is the use of the `path_ignored` method which is not defined within the function. It seems to be a method of the `Report` class that is passed as a parameter to the function. 

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `path_ignored` method is being called incorrectly, causing a NameError. 

To fix this bug, we need to use the `report` parameter to call the `path_ignored` method. The corrected code is as follows:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Pattern, Iterator

class Report:
    def path_ignored(self, path: Path, message: str) -> None:
        # implementation of path_ignored method
        pass

def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
        if child.is_dir():
            normalized_path += "/"
        exclude_match = exclude.search(normalized_path)
        if exclude_match and exclude_match.group(0):
            report.path_ignored(child, f"matches the --exclude regular expression")
            continue

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```
