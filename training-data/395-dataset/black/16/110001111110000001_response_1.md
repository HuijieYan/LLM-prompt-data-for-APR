The error occurs in the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function, specifically in the line where `normalized_path` is being created. The error message indicates that the path "/a/b/c" does not start with the expected root path.

The reason for this error is that when creating the `normalized_path`, it is using the `/` as a separator rather than the operating system-specific path separator. This causes the `normalized_path` to not match the expected root path format.

To fix this bug, we need to use the appropriate path separator for the `normalized_path` variable. We can achieve this by using the `os.path` module to correctly join the paths and ensure operating system compatibility.

Here is the corrected code for the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function:

```python
import os

def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        normalized_path = os.path.normpath(os.path.join("/", child.resolve().relative_to(root)))
        if child.is_dir():
            normalized_path += "/"
        exclude_match = exclude.search(normalized_path)
        if exclude_match and exclude_match.group(0):
            report.path_ignored(child, f"matches the --exclude regular expression")
            continue

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```

In the corrected code, `os.path.normpath` and `os.path.join` are used to create the `normalized_path`, ensuring that the path separator is compatible with the operating system. This should resolve the error encountered in the test case.
