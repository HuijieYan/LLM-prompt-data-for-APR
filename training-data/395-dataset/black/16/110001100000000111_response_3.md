The error occurs in the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function on line 2942, where the resolved path of the files is made relative to the root directory. This causes an error when the file is located outside of the root directory.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code attempts to make the resolved path of the files relative to the root directory, which is not possible if the file is located outside of the root directory.

To fix the bug, we can modify the code to handle this case by ignoring symlinked resources. If the child is a symbolic link, we should skip it and continue with the loop.

Here's the corrected code for the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Pattern, Iterator

class Report:
    def path_ignored(self, path: Path, message: str) -> None:
        """Method to report when a path is ignored."""
        pass

def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: Report,
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        if child.is_symlink():
            continue
        
        normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
        if child.is_dir():
            normalized_path += "/"
        exclude_match = exclude.search(normalized_path)
        if exclude_match and exclude_match.group(0):
            report.path_ignored(child, f"matches the --exclude regular expression")
            continue

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```

In the corrected code, when iterating over the child paths, we check if the child is a symbolic link. If it is, we skip it and continue with the loop. This change will prevent the error from occurring when a symbolic link is encountered.
