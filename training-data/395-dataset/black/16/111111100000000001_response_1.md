The potential error in the given function is the use of the `report.path_ignored()` method. This method is being called as if it's an instance method of a class, but it's actually defined as a standalone function in the first part of the code.

The reason for the bug is that the `report.path_ignored()` method is being called as if it's a method of an object, but it's actually a standalone function. To fix this, the `path_ignored` function should be called directly without the `report` object.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
        if child.is_dir():
            normalized_path += "/"
        exclude_match = exclude.search(normalized_path)
        if exclude_match and exclude_match.group(0):
            path_ignored(child, f"matches the --exclude regular expression")
            continue

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude)

        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```
