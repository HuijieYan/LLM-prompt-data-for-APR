The issue occurs at line 2942 of the function `gen_python_files_in_dir`, where the resolved path of the files is made relative to the root directory. This causes an exception to be thrown when the file is outside of the root directory, such as in the case of a symbolic link.

The potential approach for fixing the bug is to modify the code to handle the case where the file is a symbolic link pointing outside of the root directory. This can be achieved by adding a try-except block to catch the `ValueError` and continue iterating if the file is a symbolic link.

Here's the corrected code for the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Pattern, Iterator

def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        try:
            normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
        except ValueError:
            if child.is_symlink():
                continue

        if child.is_dir():
            normalized_path += "/"
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)
        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```

With this modification, the function should handle the case of symbolic links pointing outside of the root directory and continue iterating without throwing an exception.
