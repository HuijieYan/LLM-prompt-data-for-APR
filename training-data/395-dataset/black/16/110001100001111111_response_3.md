Potential error location: The error is likely to occur at the line 2942, where the resolved path of the files is made relative to the root directory.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where the resolved path of a file is outside the root directory. When trying to make the resolved path relative to the root directory, it causes a ValueError because the path is not within the root directory.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
A possible approach for fixing the bug is to catch the ValueError and continue if the child is a symbolic link, as suggested in the workaround. This will handle the case of a symlinked resource outside the root directory.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def gen_python_files_in_dir(
        path: Path,
        root: Path,
        include: Pattern[str],
        exclude: Pattern[str],
        report: "Report",
    ) -> Iterator[Path]:
        """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
        `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.
    
        `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
        """
        assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
        for child in path.iterdir():
            try:
                normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
            except ValueError:
                if child.is_symlink():
                    continue
                raise
            if child.is_dir():
                yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)
            elif child.is_file():
                include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
                if include_match:
                    yield child
