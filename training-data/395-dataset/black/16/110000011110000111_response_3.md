The error occurs in the function `gen_python_files_in_dir` at the line `normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()`. The error is due to the fact that when the function tries to resolve the path of a symlink, and then make it relative to the root directory, if the resolved path of the symlink is outside of the root directory, it throws a ValueError.

To fix this issue, a possible approach is to catch the ValueError and continue if the path of the symlink is outside of the root directory.

Below is the corrected code for the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Pattern, Iterator

def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        try:
            normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
            if child.is_dir():
                normalized_path += "/"
            exclude_match = exclude.search(normalized_path)
            if exclude_match and exclude_match.group(0):
                report.path_ignored(child, f"matches the --exclude regular expression")
                continue

            if child.is_dir():
                yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

            elif child.is_file():
                include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
                if include_match:
                    yield child
        except ValueError:
            if child.is_symlink():
                continue
            else:
                raise
```

In the corrected code, a try-except block is added to catch the ValueError when resolving the path of the symlink. If the error is caught and the file is a symlink, it continues to the next iteration of the loop. If the error is caught and the file is not a symlink, it raises the error. This prevents the ValueError from being raised when the symlink points outside of the root directory.
