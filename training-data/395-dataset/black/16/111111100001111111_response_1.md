The error occurs because the `child.resolve().relative_to(root)` line assumes that the resolved path of the child is inside the root directory, and when it's not, a ValueError is raised.

To fix the bug, you can use a try-except block to catch the ValueError, indicating that the resolved path is outside the root directory. In this case, the symlink should be ignored and the loop should continue to the next child.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        try:
            normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
        except ValueError:
            if child.is_symlink():
                continue  # Ignore symlink pointing outside of root
            else:
                raise
        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)
        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```

With this modification, the function will handle symlinks correctly and continue iterating over the children without raising an error when encountering a symlink pointing outside of the root directory.
