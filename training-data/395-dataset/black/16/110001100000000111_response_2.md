The error occurs due to the `child.resolve().relative_to(root)` statement, which tries to resolve the relative path of the files from the root directory. This causes an error when a symbolic link points to a file or directory outside of the root directory, as the resolved path cannot be made relative to the root directory.

To fix this bug, we can introduce a try-except block to handle the `ValueError` that occurs when trying to resolve the relative path for files outside of the root directory. Within the except block, we can check if the `child` is a symbolic link, and if so, we can continue to the next iteration of the loop, effectively ignoring the symlinked resource.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        try:
            normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
        except ValueError:
            if child.is_symlink():
                continue
            raise

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

        elif child.is_file():
            exclude_match = exclude.search(normalized_path)
            if exclude_match and exclude_match.group(0):
                report.path_ignored(child, f"matches the --exclude regular expression")
                continue

            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```

With this fix, the function will ignore the symlinked resources that point outside of the root directory and continue processing the other files and directories as expected.
