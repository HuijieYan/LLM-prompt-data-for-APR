The error message states that the relative path operation is not possible because the path '/a/b/c' does not start with '/Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/black_16/tests'. This indicates that the issue is with the usage of the `relative_to` method.

The potential error location seems to be in the line:
```python
normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
```

The bug occurs because `child.resolve()` is resolving the symlink, and `relative_to` method is being called on it with `root` as an argument. The `relative_to` method in `pathlib` is used to get the relative path from one path to another, and in this case, it's being called with `child.resolve()` as an argument, which is resulting in the error.

A possible fix for this bug is to construct the normalized path using the `root` path's `relative_to` method instead of calling it on the `resolve` of `child`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from typing import Pattern, Iterator
from pathlib import Path

def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)
        elif child.is_file():
            relative_to_root = root.relative_to(path)
            normalized_path = child.relative_to(relative_to_root).as_posix()
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```

In this revised version, the `normalized_path` is constructed using the `relative_to` method of the `child` path with `root` as an argument, instead of calling it on `child.resolve()`. This should address the issue and prevent the ValueError from occurring.
