The potential error location within the problematic function is around the usage of the `path` and `root` variables, especially in the line `normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `root` variable is not being used correctly. Instead of using `root` to resolve relative paths, the function should use the absolute path of `root`. Additionally, the assertion `assert root.is_absolute()` checks if `root` is an absolute path, but the actual check should be on `path` instead.

Approach:
1. Replace `root.is_absolute()` with `path.is_absolute()`.
2. Use `root` directly as the reference path for resolving relative paths.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Pattern, Iterator
from pathlib import Path

class Report:
    def path_ignored(self, path: Path, message: str) -> None:
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: Report
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    assert path.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `path` must be absolute but is {path}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().as_posix()
        if child.is_dir():
            normalized_path += "/"
        exclude_match = exclude.search(normalized_path)
        if exclude_match and exclude_match.group(0):
            report.path_ignored(child, f"matches the --exclude regular expression")
            continue

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```
