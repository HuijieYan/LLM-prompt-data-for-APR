The error occurs in the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function on the line `normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()`. The error message indicates that the resolved path of the file cannot be made relative to the root directory.

This is happening because the function tries to calculate the relative path of the resolved file with respect to the root directory, but if the resolved file is outside the root directory (in this case, due to a symlink), it raises a `ValueError`.

To fix this issue, we can handle the case where the resolved file is outside the root directory, for example by catching the `ValueError` and continuing with the next file if it is a symlink.

Here's the corrected code for the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function:

```python
def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        try:
            normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
        except ValueError:
            if child.is_symlink():
                continue
            raise

        if exclude.search(normalized_path):
            report.path_ignored(child, f"matches the --exclude regular expression")
            continue

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)
        elif child.is_file() and include.search(normalized_path):
            yield child
```

In the corrected code, we catch the `ValueError` when trying to calculate the relative path and check if the `child` is a symlink. If it is, we continue to the next iteration of the loop. If not, we re-raise the `ValueError` to handle any other unexpected errors.
