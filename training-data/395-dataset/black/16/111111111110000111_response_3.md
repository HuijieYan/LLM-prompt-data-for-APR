The error occurs while trying to resolve the relative path of the child file with respect to the root directory. When encountering a symbolic link pointing to a file or directory outside of the root directory, the `ValueError` is raised because it is not possible to create a relative path between the child file and the root directory.

To fix this issue, a possible approach is to catch the `ValueError` exception when trying to resolve the relative path. If the child is a symbolic link, we can simply continue to the next iteration of the loop, as it does not make sense to calculate a relative path for symbolic links pointing to resources outside of the root directory.

Here's the corrected code for the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function:

```python
def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        try:
            normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
        except ValueError:
            if child.is_symlink():
                continue  # Skip the symbolic link pointing to a resource outside of the root
            else:
                raise
          
        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```

By adding the `try-except` block, we catch the `ValueError` when trying to resolve the relative path and simply continue the loop if the child is a symbolic link. This ensures that the function does not raise an exception when encountering symbolic links pointing to resources outside of the root directory.
