The error occurs when calling the method `child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()`. The error message indicates that the path '/a/b/c' does not start with '/Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/black_16/tests'.

This error occurs because the `child` path is being resolved without the proper normalization process, leading to incorrect relative path calculations.

To fix the bug, the `resolve()` method should be replaced with `resolve(strict=True)`. This will ensure that the `resolve()` method normalizes the path, resolves symbolic links, and raises a `FileNotFoundError` if the path does not exist.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        resolved_child = child.resolve(strict=True)  # Normalizing and resolving symbolic links
        normalized_path = "/" + resolved_child.relative_to(root).as_posix()
        if resolved_child.is_dir():
            normalized_path += "/"
        exclude_match = exclude.search(normalized_path)
        if exclude_match and exclude_match.group(0):
            report.path_ignored(resolved_child, f"matches the --exclude regular expression")
            continue

        if resolved_child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(resolved_child, root, include, exclude, report)

        elif resolved_child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield resolved_child
```
