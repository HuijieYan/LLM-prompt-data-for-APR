The error occurs in the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function at the line `normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()` when trying to resolve the relative path to another path. The error message indicates that the path `'/a/b/c'` does not start with `'/Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/black_16/tests'`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function incorrectly constructs the `normalized_path` using the absolute path of the child and then tries to resolve its relative path to the root path. This results in an incorrect relative path, leading to the ValueError.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to construct the `normalized_path` correctly by using the child path relative to the root directly without trying to resolve the absolute path first.

Here's the corrected code for the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function:

```python
def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report",
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        normalized_path = "/" + child.relative_to(root).as_posix()
        if child.is_dir():
            normalized_path += "/"
        exclude_match = exclude.search(normalized_path)
        if exclude_match and exclude_match.group(0):
            report.path_ignored(child, f"matches the --exclude regular expression")
            continue

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```
