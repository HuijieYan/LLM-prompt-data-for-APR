The error message indicates that the relative_to method is failing when normalizing the path. The error occurs because the resolved path of the child is outside of the root directory. 

To fix the bug, a check needs to be added to prevent normalization of the paths that are outside the root directory. 

Here's the corrected code for the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function:

```python
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Pattern, Iterator


def gen_python_files_in_dir(
    path: Path,
    root: Path,
    include: Pattern[str],
    exclude: Pattern[str],
    report: "Report"
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        normalized_path = "/" + child.resolve().relative_to(root).as_posix()
        if not normalized_path.startswith('/'):
            report.path_ignored(child, "is outside of the root directory")
            continue

        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

        elif child.is_file():
            include_match = include.search(normalized_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```

In the corrected code, an additional check `if not normalized_path.startswith('/')` is added to prevent normalization of paths outside the root directory. When such a path is encountered, the `report.path_ignored` method is called to tag it as outside of the root directory. This should fix the bug and make the function behave as expected.
