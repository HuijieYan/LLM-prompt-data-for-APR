The test case calls the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function in the `black.py` script from the `black_16` repository. The error message suggests that there is an issue when calculating the `normalized_path` using the `relative_to` function. The error states that "/a/b/c" does not start with "/Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/black_16/tests".

This error occurs because the `relative_to` function is being used with incorrect arguments. The `relative_to` method is designed to return the relative path to another path identified by the passed arguments. In the given case, we are trying to find the relative path from `child.resolve()` to `root`. However, the usage is incorrect, and this leads to the ValueError.

To fix this issue, we need to construct the `normalized_path` using the `relative_to` method correctly. We should use `child` and `root` for the `relative_to` method.

The corrected code for the `gen_python_files_in_dir` function is as follows:
```python
from pathlib import Path
from typing import Pattern, Iterator

class Report:
    def path_ignored(self, path: Path, message: str) -> None:
        pass

def gen_python_files_in_dir(
        path: Path,
        root: Path,
        include: Pattern[str],
        exclude: Pattern[str],
        report: Report,
) -> Iterator[Path]:
    """Generate all files under `path` whose paths are not excluded by the
    `exclude` regex, but are included by the `include` regex.

    `report` is where output about exclusions goes.
    """
    assert root.is_absolute(), f"INTERNAL ERROR: `root` must be absolute but is {root}"
    for child in path.iterdir():
        if child.is_dir():
            yield from gen_python_files_in_dir(child, root, include, exclude, report)

        if child.is_file():
            relative_path = None
            try:
                relative_path = child.relative_to(root).as_posix().replace("\\", "/")
            except ValueError as e:
                report.path_ignored(child, f"Error getting relative path: {str(e)}")
                continue

            exclude_match = exclude.search(relative_path)
            if exclude_match and exclude_match.group(0):
                report.path_ignored(child, f"matches the --exclude regular expression")
                continue

            include_match = include.search(relative_path)
            if include_match:
                yield child
```
In this corrected code, we are using `child.relative_to(root).as_posix()` to get the `relative_path`. If a `ValueError` occurs during the `relative_to` call, it will be caught and reported using the `report.path_ignored` method.
