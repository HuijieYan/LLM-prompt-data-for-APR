The error message indicates a mismatch between the expected and actual output of the `assertFormatEqual` function within the `test_tuple_assign` test case. The expected output is a multi-line tuple assignment, whereas the actual output is a single-line tuple assignment.

The bug in the function `normalize_invisible_parens` is likely causing the issue. The function is responsible for handling the visibility of parentheses in certain cases, including tuple assignments. Judging from the error message, it seems that the function is not correctly handling the visibility of parentheses in tuple assignments, leading to incorrect formatting.

The function `normalize_invisible_parens` has a conditional logic to handle different cases when deciding whether to make parentheses visible or invisible. However, there might be a flaw in handling tuple assignments, specifically when the left side is backslashed, leading to the incorrect formatting.

To fix this bug, the logic for handling tuple assignments should be carefully reviewed and updated. Specifically, the function should correctly handle backslashed tuple assignments to ensure the correct formatting.

Here's the corrected code for the `normalize_invisible_parens` function, addressing the issue described:

```python
from typing import Set
from typing_extensions import Final
from lib2to3 import syms
from lib2to3.pytree import Node, Leaf
from lib2to3.pgen2 import token

FMT_OFF: Final = set()
# Update the above line with the actual set containing formatting options

def normalize_invisible_parens(node: Node, parens_after: Set[str]) -> None:
    for pc in list_comments(node.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
        if pc.value in FMT_OFF:
            return

    check_lpar = False
    for index, child in enumerate(list(node.children)):
        if check_lpar:
            if child.type == syms.atom:
                if maybe_make_parens_invisible_in_atom(child, parent=node):
                    lpar = Leaf(token.LPAR, "")
                    rpar = Leaf(token.RPAR, "")
                    index = child.remove() or 0
                    node.insert_child(index, Node(syms.atom, [lpar, child, rpar]))
            elif is_one_tuple(child):
                lpar = Leaf(token.LPAR, "(")
                rpar = Leaf(token.RPAR, ")")
                child.remove()
                node.insert_child(index, Node(syms.atom, [lpar, child, rpar]))
            elif (node.type == syms.small_stmt and
                  len(node.children) > 1 and
                  isinstance(node.children[1], Node) and
                  node.children[1].type == syms.import_name):
                if child.type == token.LPAR:
                    child.value = ""
                    node.children[-1].value = ""
                elif child.type != token.STAR:
                    node.insert_child(index, Leaf(token.LPAR, ""))
                    node.append_child(Leaf(token.RPAR, ""))
                break
            elif not (isinstance(child, Leaf) and is_multiline_string(child)):
                lpar = Leaf(token.LPAR, "")
                rpar = Leaf(token.RPAR, "")
                index = child.remove() or 0
                node.insert_child(index, Node(syms.atom, [lpar, child, rpar]))

        check_lpar = isinstance(child, Leaf) and child.value in parens_after
```

Please note that the actual conditions and logic for handling tuple assignments may vary based on the specific requirements and behavior of the `normalize_invisible_parens` function. Therefore, additional adjustments might be necessary based on the actual behavior and use cases of the function.
