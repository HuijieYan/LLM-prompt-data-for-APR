It seems that the `normalize_invisible_parens` function is not creating the expected output, leading to test failures. The error message indicates a mismatch between the expected and actual outputs.

The potential error in the function might be related to the logic for handling parentheses and inserting new nodes into the abstract syntax tree (AST).

The bug might be caused by incorrect handling of the `child.type` and the subsequent conditional blocks inside the for loop. It seems that the logic for handling different child types and inserting parentheses is not functioning as expected, leading to incorrect output.

To fix the bug, we can review the conditional blocks and the logic for handling different child types, and make necessary adjustments to ensure that the correct nodes are being inserted with parentheses.

Below is the corrected code for the `normalize_invisible_parens` function:

```python
def normalize_invisible_parens(node: Node, parens_after: Set[str]) -> None:
    for pc in list_comments(node.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
        if pc.value in FMT_OFF:
            # This `node` has a prefix with `# fmt: off`, don't mess with parens.
            return

    check_lpar = False
    for index, child in enumerate(list(node.children)):
        if check_lpar and isinstance(child, Node):
            if is_one_tuple(child):
                # wrap child in visible parentheses
                lpar = Leaf(token.LPAR, "(")
                rpar = Leaf(token.RPAR, ")")
                node.insert_child(index, Node(syms.atom, [lpar, child, rpar]))
            elif node.type == syms.import_from:
                if isinstance(child, Leaf) and child.type == token.LPAR:
                    # make parentheses invisible
                    child.value = ""  # type: ignore
                    node.children[-1].value = ""  # type: ignore
                elif child.type != token.STAR:
                    # insert invisible parentheses
                    node.insert_child(index, Leaf(token.LPAR, ""))
                    node.append_child(Leaf(token.RPAR, ""))
                break
            else:
                # wrap child in invisible parentheses
                lpar = Leaf(token.LPAR, "")
                rpar = Leaf(token.RPAR, "")
                node.insert_child(index, Node(syms.atom, [lpar, child, rpar]))

        check_lpar = isinstance(child, Leaf) and child.value in parens_after
```

In this corrected code, I simplified the conditional blocks for handling different child types and adjusted the logic for inserting parentheses, based on the child type and the parent node type.

This fix should address the incorrect output and resolve the test failures.
