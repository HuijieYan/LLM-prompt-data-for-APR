The test case `test_tuple_assign` is testing the format of the output from the `fs` function, which is likely the `normalize_invisible_parens` function. The error message indicates that the expected and actual outputs do not match, specifically related to line length and formatting of the tuple assignment.

The bug is likely occurring in the `normalize_invisible_parens` function inside the `list_comments` function, where the logic for handling parentheses and comments seems to be incorrect. This is likely causing incorrect formatting in tuple assignments, leading to the mismatch in the test case.

The bug seems to be related to the handling of parentheses, especially in cases with multi-line code or complex tuple assignments. This could be because the logic to handle different types of parentheses and comments is not correctly implemented.

To fix this bug, the logic for handling parentheses and comments needs to be reviewed and revised. Specifically, the logic for adding, removing, or modifying parentheses and comments based on different conditions needs to be updated to ensure correct formatting.

The corrected function `normalize_invisible_parens` is provided as follows:

```python
def normalize_invisible_parens(node: Node, parens_after: Set[str]) -> None:
    """Make existing optional parentheses invisible or create new ones.

    `parens_after` is a set of string leaf values immeditely after which parens
    should be put.

    Standardizes on visible parentheses for single-element tuples, and keeps
    existing visible parentheses for other tuples and generator expressions.
