The error message indicates a comparison failure between the expected and actual values of a tuple assignment. The expected value is a tuple with line breaks and indentation, while the actual value is a single line with no indentation. This suggests that the `normalize_invisible_parens` function is not handling tuple assignments correctly, leading to formatting issues.

The potential error location within the `normalize_invisible_parens` function is likely to be in the logic that deals with tuple assignments, specifically in the `is_one_tuple(child)` condition block. This logic is responsible for wrapping a child in visible parentheses, which seems to be causing the formatting issue.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely due to the incorrect handling of tuple assignments within the `normalize_invisible_parens` function. This results in the generation of incorrect formatted code, causing the test case to fail.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling tuple assignments needs to be revised within the `normalize_invisible_parens` function. Specifically, the condition for `is_one_tuple(child)` should be corrected to properly handle tuple assignments.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from typing import Set
from black.node import Node

def normalize_invisible_parens(node: Node, parens_after: Set[str]) -> None:
    """Make existing optional parentheses invisible or create new ones.

    `parens_after` is a set of string leaf values immeditely after which parens
    should be put.

    Standardizes on visible parentheses for single-element tuples, and keeps
    existing visible parentheses for other tuples and generator expressions.
    """
    for pc in node.prefix:
        if pc.value in FMT_OFF:
            # This `node` has a prefix with `# fmt: off`, don't mess with parens.
            return

    check_lpar = False
    for index, child in enumerate(node.children[:]):
        if check_lpar:
            # revise the logic for handling tuple assignments
            if child.type == syms.testlist_comp and len(child.children) == 1:
                lpar = Leaf(token.LPAR, "(")
                rpar = Leaf(token.RPAR, ")")
                child.remove()
                node.insert_child(index, Node(syms.testlist_comp, [lpar, child, rpar]))
        check_lpar = isinstance(child, Leaf) and child.value in parens_after
```

This correction includes modifying the tuple assignment handling logic to properly wrap a single-element tuple in visible parentheses. This should resolve the formatting issue reported in the test case.
