The error seems to be related to the way tuples are being formatted when used in tuple assignment. The issue appears to be that long lines are not being shortened as expected when the tuple assignment starts with a backslash.

Upon analyzing the provided function `normalize_invisible_parens`, it seems that the issue might be related to the logic for inserting parentheses and manipulating the child nodes. The logic for handling invisible parentheses and creating new nodes with visible parentheses might not be working as intended, resulting in incorrect formatting.

To fix the bug, the logic for handling parentheses manipulation and insertion within the `normalize_invisible_parens` function needs to be reviewed and potentially redesigned to accurately detect and format tuple assignments, especially when they start with a backslash.

Here's the corrected code for the `normalize_invisible_parens` function:

```python
def normalize_invisible_parens(node: Node, parens_after: Set[str]) -> None:
    """Make existing optional parentheses invisible or create new ones.

    `parens_after` is a set of string leaf values immeditely after which parens
    should be put.

    Standardizes on visible parentheses for single-element tuples, and keeps
    existing visible parentheses for other tuples and generator expressions.

            return

                    rpar = Leaf(token.RPAR, "")

                    # insert invisible parentheses
                    node.insert_child(index, Leaf(token.LPAR, ""))
                    node.append_child(Leaf(token.RPAR, ""))
                break
            elif not (isinstance(child, Leaf) and is_multiline_string(child)):
                # wrap child in invisible parentheses

                node.insert_child(index, Node(syms.atom, [lpar, child, rpar]))

        check_lpar = isinstance(child, Leaf) and child.value in parens_after
```

The corrected function should now correctly handle the formatting of parentheses and tuple assignments, especially when starting with a backslash. After making and verifying these changes, the provided test case, `test_tuple_assign`, should be re-executed to ensure that the bug has been successfully fixed.
