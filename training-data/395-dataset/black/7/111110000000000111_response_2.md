The error seems to be related to how the function `normalize_invisible_parens` handles the formatting of tuples in the given code. The issue description indicates that when a tuple assignment spans multiple lines and starts with a backslash, the line is not being shortened as expected.

Upon analyzing the buggy function, it appears that the error might be related to the condition that checks for `child.type == syms.atom`, which is responsible for handling the tuples and parentheses.

The potential error location is within the if-elif-else block where the function processes the child nodes of the `node`. It seems that the condition for handling the tuples and their parentheses might not be correctly addressing the specific case described in the issue.

The bug is likely occurring because the function is not correctly identifying and handling the formatting of tuples, specifically when they start as a backslashed tuple assignment left side.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to review and update the condition for handling tuples and their parentheses in the function. It may involve adjusting the logic to correctly identify the start of a backslashed tuple assignment left side and appropriately formatting it.

Here's the corrected code for the `normalize_invisible_parens` function:

```python
def normalize_invisible_parens(node: Node, parens_after: Set[str]) -> None:
    # ... (other parts of the function remains unchanged)

    check_lpar = False
    for index, child in enumerate(list(node.children)):
        if check_lpar:
            if child.type == syms.atom:
                # Check if it's a backslashed tuple assignment left side
                if child.value == "\\":
                    # wrap child in visible parentheses
                    lpar = Leaf(token.LPAR, "(")
                    rpar = Leaf(token.RPAR, ")")
                    child.remove()
                    node.insert_child(index, Node(syms.atom, [lpar, child, rpar]))
            # ... (other conditions for handling other types of nodes)

        check_lpar = isinstance(child, Leaf) and child.value in parens_after
```

In the corrected code, a specific condition checks for a backslashed tuple assignment left side and then wraps it in visible parentheses to handle the formatting issue described in the bug report.
