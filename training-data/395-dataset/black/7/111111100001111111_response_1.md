The error occurs in the `normalize_invisible_parens` function. It seems that the function is not handling the insertion and removal of parentheses correctly. This is causing the lines to not be shortened correctly, especially when they start with a backslashed tuple assignment left side.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle the insertion and removal of parentheses. Additionally, the logic for handling prefixes and comments should be reviewed to ensure that it does not interfere with the insertion and removal of parentheses.

Here's the corrected code for the `normalize_invisible_parens` function:

```python
from typing import List, Set

def normalize_invisible_parens(node: Node, parens_after: Set[str]) -> None:
    """Make existing optional parentheses invisible or create new ones.

    `parens_after` is a set of string leaf values immediately after which parens
    should be put.

    Standardizes on visible parentheses for single-element tuples, and keeps
    existing visible parentheses for other tuples and generator expressions.
    """
    # Keep track of the index of the child to insert parentheses
    insert_index = 0
    for pc in list_comments(node.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
        if pc.value in FMT_OFF:
            # This `node` has a prefix with `# fmt: off`, don't mess with parens.
            return

    check_lpar = False
    for index, child in enumerate(list(node.children)):
        if check_lpar:
            if child.type == syms.atom:
                if maybe_make_parens_invisible_in_atom(child, parent=node):
                    lpar = Leaf(token.LPAR, "")
                    rpar = Leaf(token.RPAR, "")
                    node.insert_child(insert_index, Node(syms.atom, [lpar, child, rpar]))
                    insert_index += 1
                    # Skip the next child, since its parentheses have already been inserted
                    index += 1

                # wrap child in visible parentheses
                lpar = Leaf(token.LPAR, "(")
                rpar = Leaf(token.RPAR, ")")
                node.insert_child(insert_index, Node(syms.atom, [lpar, child, rpar]))
