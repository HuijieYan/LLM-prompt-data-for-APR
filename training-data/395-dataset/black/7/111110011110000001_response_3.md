The error message from the test function `test_tuple_assign` indicates that the `assertFormatEqual` function is failing due to a mismatch between the expected and actual output. The assertion failure occurs because the expected output contains parentheses around the tuple, while the actual output does not.

The potential error location within the buggy function is likely in the `normalize_invisible_parens` function, specifically where it handles wrapping the child in visible parentheses.

The bug occurs because the function does not consistently handle wrapping tuples in visible parentheses. It seems to have inconsistent logic for when to wrap a child in parentheses, resulting in different outputs for the same input.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to standardize the approach for wrapping children in visible parentheses for single-element tuples and ensure consistency in handling parentheses for different node types.

Here's the corrected code for the `normalize_invisible_parens` function:

```python
from typing import Set
from typed_ast import ast3 as ast


def normalize_invisible_parens(node: ast.Node, parens_after: Set[str]) -> None:
    for pc in list_comments(node.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
        if pc.value in FMT_OFF:
            # This `node` has a prefix with `# fmt: off`, don't mess with parens.
            return

    check_lpar = False
    for index, child in enumerate(list(node.children)):
        if check_lpar:
            if isinstance(child, ast.Expr) and len(child.elts) == 1:
                # wrap single-element tuples in visible parentheses
                lpar = ast.LPar()
                rpar = ast.RPar()
                child.elts[0].remove()
                child.elts.insert(0, lpar)
                child.elts.append(rpar)

        check_lpar = isinstance(child, ast.Expr) and len(child.elts) == 1 and child.value in parens_after
```
In the corrected code:
1. The function signature is updated to use `ast3` module for abstract syntax trees.
2. The logic is modified to consistently wrap single-element tuples in visible parentheses.
3. The handling of `check_lpar` and `parens_after` is updated to ensure the correct placement of visible parentheses.

This corrected code aims to address the inconsistency in handling visible parentheses and provide a standardized approach for wrapping single-element tuples.
