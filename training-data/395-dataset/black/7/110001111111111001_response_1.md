The error message is indicating a mismatch between the expected and actual values returned by the `fs` function. The test case `test_tuple_assign` compares the expected and actual output from `fs` using the `assertFormatEqual` method. The error message suggests that the actual output is not matching the expected output.

Looking at the code of the `fs` function and the input parameters passed to it, the problem seems to lie within the `normalize_invisible_parens` function. The logic within this function might not be producing the expected output, leading to the test failure.

The bug in the `normalize_invisible_parens` function may be caused by the logic for inserting invisible parentheses or making existing parentheses invisible. The conditions and logic for handling different types of nodes and their children could be incorrect, leading to the mismatch between the expected and actual results.

To fix the bug, the logic within the `normalize_invisible_parens` function needs to be revised. While inserting or modifying parentheses, the correct conditions and order of operations need to be applied to ensure that the visible and invisible parentheses are handled properly based on the requirements.

Here's the corrected code for the `normalize_invisible_parens` function:

```python
from typing import Set, List
from black import FMT_OFF  # Assuming FMT_OFF is imported from the black module
from black.ProtoComment import ProtoComment
from black.LN import LN
from black.Leaf import Leaf
from black.Node import Node
from black.syms import syms
from black.token import LPAR, RPAR, NAME, COMMA, EQUAL, NUMBER, STAR
from black.LN import ProtoComment

def normalize_invisible_parens(node: Node, parens_after: Set[str]) -> None:
    """Make existing optional parentheses invisible or create new ones.

    `parens_after` is a set of string leaf values immediately after which parens should be put.

    Standardizes on visible parentheses for single-element tuples, and keeps
    existing visible parentheses for other tuples and generator expressions.
    """
    for pc in list_comments(node.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
        if pc.value in FMT_OFF:
            # This `node` has a prefix with `# fmt: off`, don't mess with parens.
            return

    check_lpar = False
    for index, child in enumerate(list(node.children)):
        if check_lpar:
            if child.type == syms.atom:
                if maybe_make_parens_invisible_in_atom(child, parent=node):
                    lpar = Leaf(LPAR, "")
                    rpar = Leaf(RPAR, "")
                    index = child.remove() or 0
                    node.insert_child(index, Node(syms.atom, [lpar, child, rpar]))
            elif is_one_tuple(child):
                # wrap child in visible parentheses
                lpar = Leaf(LPAR, "(")
                rpar = Leaf(RPAR, ")")
                child.remove()
                node.insert_child(index, Node(syms.atom, [lpar, child, rpar]))
            elif node.type == syms.import_from:
                # "import from" nodes store parentheses directly as part of the statement
                if child.type == LPAR:
                    # make parentheses invisible
                    child.value = ""
                    node.children[-1].value = ""
                elif child.type != STAR:
                    # insert invisible parentheses
                    node.insert_child(index, Leaf(LPAR, ""))
                    node.append_child(Leaf(RPAR, ""))
                break

            elif not (isinstance(child, Leaf) and is_multiline_string(child)):
                # wrap child in invisible parentheses
                lpar = Leaf(LPAR, "")
                rpar = Leaf(RPAR, "")
                index = child.remove() or 0
                node.insert_child(index, Node(syms.atom, [lpar, child, rpar]))

        check_lpar = isinstance(child, Leaf) and child.value in parens_after
```

The corrected code addresses the potential issues with inserting or modifying invisible parentheses and ensures that the logic is correctly handling different node types and their children. This should resolve the bug and make the `normalize_invisible_parens` function work as expected, passing the `test_tuple_assign` test case.
