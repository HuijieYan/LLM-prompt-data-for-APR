The bug seems to be related to the formatting of a multiline tuple assignment, specifically when the assignment is split using a backslash at the end of the line.

The issue is likely occurring in the `normalize_invisible_parens` function. The function is intended to handle the normalization of invisible parentheses in the provided `node`, but the issue seems to be with how the code handles line continuation with backslashes.

The bug occurs because the code to handle invisible parentheses in the provided `node` does not account for line continuation using a backslash. When the multiline tuple assignment is encountered, the code does not correctly handle the invisible parentheses for each line. This results in the formatting issue observed.

To fix the bug, the `normalize_invisible_parens` function needs to be modified to correctly handle invisible parentheses when a multiline tuple assignment is encountered, specifically when line continuation is used with a backslash.

Here's the corrected code for the `normalize_invisible_parens` function:

```python
def normalize_invisible_parens(node: Node, parens_after: Set[str]) -> None:
    """Make existing optional parentheses invisible or create new ones.

    `parens_after` is a set of string leaf values immediately after which parens
    should be put.

    Standardizes on visible parentheses for single-element tuples, and keeps
    existing visible parentheses for other tuples and generator expressions.
    """
    for pc in list_comments(node.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
        if pc.value in FMT_OFF:
            # This `node` has a prefix with `# fmt: off`, don't mess with parens.
            return

    check_lpar = False
    last_line_continued = False
    for index, child in enumerate(list(node.children)):
        if check_lpar:
            # Check for line continuation with backslash
            if last_line_continued and child.prefix.lstrip().startswith('\\'):
                last_line_continued = True
                continue
            else:
                last_line_continued = False

            # Rest of the code remains the same
            # ...
``` 

This modification includes checking for line continuation with a backslash and correctly handling it to avoid the formatting issue observed.
