The error occurs because the `normalize_invisible_parens` function is not handling the tuple assignment properly when it starts with a backslash. This causes the line to not be shortened as expected.

The bug occurs in the part of the code where it is checking for backslashes and handling tuple assignments.

To fix the bug, the function should check for backslashes and handle the tuple assignment left side correctly to ensure the line is shortened accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Set
from libcst import Node, Leaf, syms, FMT_OFF, token
from libcst.helpers import list_comments, maybe_make_parens_invisible_in_atom, is_one_tuple, is_multiline_string

def normalize_invisible_parens(node: Node, parens_after: Set[str]) -> None:
    """Make existing optional parentheses invisible or create new ones.

    `parens_after` is a set of string leaf values immediately after which parens
    should be put.

    Standardizes on visible parentheses for single-element tuples, and keeps
    existing visible parentheses for other tuples and generator expressions.
    """
    for pc in list_comments(node.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
        if pc.value in FMT_OFF:
            # This `node` has a prefix with `# fmt: off`, don't mess with parens.
            return

    check_slash = False
    for index, child in enumerate(list(node.children)):
        if check_slash:
            # handle backslash continuation for tuple assignment
            if isinstance(child, Leaf) and child.type == token.COMMA and child.prefix.lstrip().startswith("\\"):
                if index + 1 < len(node.children):
                    node.children[index+1].prefix = "\\" + node.children[index+1].prefix.lstrip()
            check_slash = False

        if isinstance(child, Leaf) and child.value == "\\":
            # detected backslash continuation
            check_slash = True
        
        if isinstance(child, Leaf) and child.value in parens_after:
            if is_one_tuple(child):
                lpar = Leaf(token.LPAR, "(")
                rpar = Leaf(token.RPAR, ")")
                child.remove()
                node.insert_child(index, Node(syms.atom, [lpar, child, rpar]))

            elif node.type == syms.import_from and child.type == token.LPAR:
                # make parentheses invisible
                child.value = ""
                node.children[-1].value = ""
            elif child.type != token.STAR:
                # insert invisible parentheses
                node.insert_child(index, Leaf(token.LPAR, ""))
                node.append_child(Leaf(token.RPAR, ""))
            break
```

In the corrected code, we have added a check for backslash continuation and handled tuple assignment correctly. This should fix the issue where the line was not being shortened as expected. After making these changes, the `normalize_invisible_parens` function should handle tuple assignments properly, ensuring the line is shortened when it starts with a backslash.
