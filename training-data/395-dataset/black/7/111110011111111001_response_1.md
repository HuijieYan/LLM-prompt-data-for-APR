The error seems to be related to the difference between the expected and actual outputs from the function `fs(source)`. It appears that the tuple formatting is not as expected, resulting in a failed assertion.

The potential error within the `normalize_invisible_parens` function could be in the logic responsible for handling the creation and modification of parentheses around nodes.

The bug might be occurring due to incorrect handling of parentheses insertion and removal based on the node types and their respective Leaf values.

To fix the bug, the conditional logic for handling the parentheses around nodes needs to be carefully reviewed and corrected.

Here's the corrected code for the `normalize_invisible_parens` function:

```python
from typing import Set
from typed_ast import Node

def normalize_invisible_parens(node: Node, parens_after: Set[str]) -> None:
    for pc in list_comments(node.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
        if pc.value in FMT_OFF:
            return

    check_lpar = False
    for index, child in enumerate(list(node.children)):
        if check_lpar:
            if isinstance(child, Node) and child.type == syms.atom:
                if maybe_make_parens_invisible_in_atom(child, parent=node):
                    lpar = Leaf(token.LPAR, "")
                    rpar = Leaf(token.RPAR, "")
                    index = child.remove() or 0
                    node.insert_child(index, Node(syms.atom, [lpar, child, rpar]))
            elif is_one_tuple(child):
                lpar = Leaf(token.LPAR, "(")
                rpar = Leaf(token.RPAR, ")")
                child.remove()
                node.insert_child(index, Node(syms.atom, [lpar, child, rpar]))
            elif node.type == syms.import_from:
                if isinstance(child, Leaf) and child.type == token.LPAR:
                    child.value = ""  # make parentheses invisible
                    node.children[-1].value = ""
                elif child.type != token.STAR:
                    node.insert_child(index, Leaf(token.LPAR, ""))  # insert invisible parentheses
                    node.append_child(Leaf(token.RPAR, ""))
                break
            elif not (isinstance(child, Leaf) and is_multiline_string(child)):
                lpar = Leaf(token.LPAR, "")  # wrap child in invisible parentheses
                rpar = Leaf(token.RPAR, "")
                index = child.remove() or 0
                node.insert_child(index, Node(syms.atom, [lpar, child, rpar]))

        check_lpar = isinstance(child, Leaf) and child.value in parens_after
```

In this corrected code, the conditional logic for handling parentheses around nodes based on their types and leaf values has been adjusted. This should address the issues observed in the test case and fix the potential bugs in the `normalize_invisible_parens` function.
