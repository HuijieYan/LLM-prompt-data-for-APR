Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the `normalize_invisible_parens` function due to issues with iterating through the children of the `node` and attempting to manipulate the nodes and leaves based on certain conditions.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug may be caused by incorrect manipulation of the nodes and leaves within the `normalize_invisible_parens` function. It seems that the function is trying to check and modify the parentheses visibility based on certain conditions, but the implementation is incorrect, leading to unexpected behavior.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Re-evaluate the logic of the function and ensure that the manipulation of nodes and leaves is done correctly according to the specified conditions.
2. Use proper iteration and indexing when interacting with the children of the `node` to avoid potential off-by-one errors or incorrect operations.
3. Validate the conditions and operations for checking and modifying the parentheses visibility to ensure it aligns with the intended behavior.

Corrected code for the `normalize_invisible_parens` function:

```python
from typing import List, Set
from tree import ProtoComment, LN, Leaf, Node

def normalize_invisible_parens(node: Node, parens_after: Set[str]) -> None:
    """Make existing optional parentheses invisible or create new ones.

    `parens_after` is a set of string leaf values immediately after which parens should be put.

    Standardizes on visible parentheses for single-element tuples, and keeps
    existing visible parentheses for other tuples and generator expressions.

        if pc.value in FMT_OFF:
            # This `node` has a prefix with `# fmt: off`, don't mess with parens.
            return

    for index, child in enumerate(list(node.children)):
        if isinstance(child, Leaf) and child.value in parens_after:
            if child.type == token.LPAR:

                child.value = ""

            elif is_one_tuple(child):
