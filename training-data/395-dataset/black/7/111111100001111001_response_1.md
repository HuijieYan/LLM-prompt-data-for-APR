The issue in the `normalize_invisible_parens` function seems to be related to modifying the child nodes of the `node` input parameter. The code tries to add or modify parentheses based on certain conditions, and it seems to be handling different types of nodes (e.g., `atom`, `import_from`, `multiline_string`) which might lead to the mismanagement of the child nodes.

The `normalized_invisible_parens` function should ideally traverse the `node` and check and update the children nodes as needed without incorrect insertion or manipulation.

One possible approach to resolve this issue is to carefully handle the insertion and removal of child nodes by tracking the indices and modifying the list of children. Additionally, it might be necessary to revisit the conditions for adding, removing, or modifying parentheses based on the specific types of nodes and their context.

Below is the corrected code for the `normalized_invisible_parens` function:

```python
def normalize_invisible_parens(node: Node, parens_after: Set[str]) -> None:
    """Make existing optional parentheses invisible or create new ones.

    `parens_after` is a set of string leaf values immediately after which parens
    should be put.

    Standardizes on visible parentheses for single-element tuples, and keeps
    existing visible parentheses for other tuples and generator expressions.
    """
    stmts = [item for item in node.children if isinstance(item, Node) and item.type == syms.atom]
    for stmt in stmts:
        if maybe_make_parens_invisible_in_atom(stmt, parent=node):
            lpar = Leaf(token.LPAR, "")
            rpar = Leaf(token.RPAR, "")
            index = node.children.index(stmt)
            node.children[index] = Node(syms.atom, [lpar, stmt, rpar])

    for i, stmt in enumerate(node.children):
        if is_one_tuple(stmt):
            lpar = Leaf(token.LPAR, "(")
            rpar = Leaf(token.RPAR, ")")
            node.children[i] = Node(syms.atom, [lpar, stmt, rpar])
```

The corrected code traverses the `node` and identifies the `stmts` based on certain conditions. For each statement, it checks if the invisible parentheses can be made in the `atom` and applies the changes accordingly. Then, it checks if the statement is a single-element tuple and wraps it with parentheses. The revised code simplifies the logic and should handle adding, removing, or modifying parentheses more accurately.
