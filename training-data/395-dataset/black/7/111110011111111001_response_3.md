The error message indicates a mismatch between the expected and actual output of the function `fs`. The test case involves tuple assignments, and it seems that the function `fs` is not handling them correctly.

Upon analyzing the provided code, it seems that the issue may be related to the `normalize_invisible_parens` function. The function is meant to handle the creation of parentheses for tuples and generator expressions. It checks for comments and then iterates through the children of a node to insert or update parentheses.

One potential reason for the bug could be the mishandling of parentheses insertion and removal within tuples. The function may not be correctly identifying the presence of parentheses and deciding whether to make them visible or invisible.

To fix the bug, the `normalize_invisible_parens` function should be revised to ensure that it properly handles the insertion and removal of parentheses for tuples and generator expressions.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from typing import Set
from typed_ast import Node


def normalize_invisible_parens(node: Node, parens_after: Set[str]) -> None:
    for pc in node.list_comments(is_endmarker=False):
        if pc.value in FMT_OFF:
            # This `node` has a prefix with `# fmt: off`, don't mess with parens.
            return

    check_lpar = False
    for index, child in enumerate(node.children):
        if check_lpar:
            if child.type == syms.atom:
                if maybe_make_parens_invisible_in_atom(child, parent=node):
                    lpar = Leaf(token.LPAR, "")
                    rpar = Leaf(token.RPAR, "")
                    index = child.remove() or 0
                    node.insert_child(index, Node(syms.atom, [lpar, child, rpar]))
            elif is_one_tuple(child):
                # wrap child in visible parentheses
                lpar = Leaf(token.LPAR, "(")
                rpar = Leaf(token.RPAR, ")")
                child.remove()
                node.insert_child(index, Node(syms.atom, [lpar, child, rpar]))
            elif node.type == syms.import_from:
                # "import from" nodes store parentheses directly as part of the statement
                if child.type == token.LPAR:
                    # make parentheses invisible
                    child.value = ""  # type: ignore
                    node.children[-1].value = ""  # type: ignore
                elif child.type != token.STAR:
                    # insert invisible parentheses
                    node.insert_child(index, Leaf(token.LPAR, ""))
                    node.append_child(Leaf(token.RPAR, ""))
                break

            elif not (isinstance(child, Leaf) and is_multiline_string(child)):
                # wrap child in invisible parentheses
                lpar = Leaf(token.LPAR, "")
                rpar = Leaf(token.RPAR, "")
                index = child.remove() or 0
                node.insert_child(index, Node(syms.atom, [lpar, child, rpar]))

        check_lpar = isinstance(child, Leaf) and child.value in parens_after
```

It's important to note that the provided code contains references to functions and variables (`FMT_OFF`, `syms`, etc.) that are not defined in the given code snippet. Therefore, these dependencies need to be resolved to ensure the corrected function works as intended.
