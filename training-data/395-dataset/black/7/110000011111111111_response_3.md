The error occurred when the `assertFormatEqual` function was called in the test case `test_tuple_assign`. The error message indicates that the expected and actual outputs are different, with the actual output not being formatted correctly.

The issue seems to be related to the formatting of a tuple assignment. When the tuple assignment has line breaks with backslashes at the end of the lines, the formatting of the tuples is not being handled correctly, resulting in incorrect output.

The potential error within the `normalize_invisible_parens` function could be in the logic that handles the formatting of tuples. The current implementation does not seem to handle tuple assignments with backslashes and line breaks correctly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
1. Implementing specific logic to handle tuple assignments with backslashes and line breaks to ensure correct formatting.
2. Checking for cases where a tuple assignment is being split across multiple lines with backslashes and adjusting the formatting accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `normalize_invisible_parens` function:

```python
def normalize_invisible_parens(node: Node, parens_after: Set[str]) -> None:
    for pc in list_comments(node.prefix, is_endmarker=False):
        if pc.value in FMT_OFF:
            return

    check_lpar = False
    for index, child in enumerate(list(node.children)):
        if check_lpar:
            if node.type == syms.expr_stmt:
                if child.type == syms.atom:
                    lpar = Leaf(token.LPAR, "")
                    rpar = Leaf(token.RPAR, "")
                    child.remove()
                    node.insert_child(index, Node(syms.atom, [lpar, child, rpar]))
            check_lpar = isinstance(child, Leaf) and child.value in parens_after
```

It's important to note that this is a partial correction, and further changes may be necessary to handle tuple assignments with backslashes and line breaks more effectively.
