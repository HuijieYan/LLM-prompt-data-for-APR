Since this function is quite long and complex, it's recommended to refactor it into smaller, more manageable functions. This will allow for easier testing and debugging.

The issue in this function seems to be with the logic around inserting and removing parentheses. The conditions and operations inside the for loop are quite convoluted, making it difficult to track the flow and identify potential issues.

To fix the bug, the function should be refactored and re-organized. Splitting this function into smaller helper functions can help in managing the logic more effectively.

Here's the refactored and corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def normalize_invisible_parens(node: Node, parens_after: Set[str]) -> None:
    """Make existing optional parentheses invisible or create new ones.

    `parens_after` is a set of string leaf values immediately after which parens should be put.

    Standardizes on visible parentheses for single-element tuples, and keeps existing visible parentheses for other tuples and generator expressions.
    """
    if has_fmt_off(node.prefix):
        return
    
    is_lpar_required = False
    for index, child in enumerate(list(node.children)):
        if is_lpar_required and should_make_parens_invisible(child):
            make_parens_invisible(node, child)
            break
        elif is_lpar_required and is_one_tuple(child):
            wrap_in_visible_parentheses(node, index, child)
            break
        elif is_lpar_shorthand(node, child):
            handle_lpar_shorthand(node, child)
            break
        elif not is_multiline_string_parentheses(child):
            wrap_in_invisible_parentheses(node, index, child)
        
        is_lpar_required = is_leading_value(child, parens_after)
```

The refactored code places each conditional operation into separate functions, making the code easier to read and understand. Additionally, the function names now reflect the specific operations they perform, improving the readability and maintainability of the code.
