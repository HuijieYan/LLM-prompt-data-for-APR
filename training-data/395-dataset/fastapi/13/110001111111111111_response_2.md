The error is occurring in the `include_router` function, where the responses for different paths are being merged when they should not be. This problem arises when defining routes with an APIRouter, as their alternative responses are being shared.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `include_router` function to ensure that the responses for different paths are not merged. One approach to achieve this is to initialize the `responses` variable outside the loop and then update it for each route. Additionally, for paths added directly to the FastAPI app instance, the responses should not be merged.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` function:

```python
def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
    responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    if responses is None:
        responses = {}
    
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            response_copy = responses.copy()  # Create a copy of responses for each route
            response_copy = {**response_copy, **route.responses}
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=response_copy,  # Use the updated responses for the route
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```
