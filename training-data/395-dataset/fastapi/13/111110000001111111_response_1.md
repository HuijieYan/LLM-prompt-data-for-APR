The bug occurs in the `include_router` function when iterating over the routes in the `router` parameter. The bug causes the `responses` to be shared among different routes, resulting in unexpected behavior when defining routes with an API router. This bug seems to occur due to the mutable nature of dictionaries and the incorrect handling of responses for different routes.

To fix the bug, the `responses` should be initialized outside of the loop and then updated for each route, instead of merging them with the existing `responses`. This will ensure that each route's responses are handled separately without being shared.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` function:

```python
def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
    responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    
    if responses is None:
        responses = {}
    
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            route_responses = responses.copy()  # create a copy of the responses for the current route
            route_responses.update(route.responses)  # update the responses with route-specific responses
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=route_responses,  # use the updated responses for the route
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```

With this corrected code, the `responses` dictionary is initialized within the function and then updated for each route, ensuring that responses are handled separately for each route and not shared among different routes.
