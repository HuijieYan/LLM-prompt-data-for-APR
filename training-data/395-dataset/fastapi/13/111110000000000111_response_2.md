The issue seems to be related to the shared `responses` when defining routes with the `APIRouter` instance. When including routes from the same `APIRouter` instance, their alternative responses are shared, causing unexpected behavior.

The potential error location is within the `include_router` function, where it is merging the responses from different routes into a single dictionary, causing the shared `responses` behavior.

The bug occurs because the `responses` dictionary is being shared across different routes within the same `APIRouter` instance. When a new route is added, its responses are merged with the existing responses, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, a new `responses` dictionary should be created for each route and then merged with the existing responses. This will ensure that the responses for different paths are not merged and behave as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` function:

```python
def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
    responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            route_responses = responses.copy() if responses else {}
            route_responses.update(route.responses)
            
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=route_responses,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```
