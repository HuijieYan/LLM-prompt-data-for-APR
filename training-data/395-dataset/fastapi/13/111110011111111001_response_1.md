The bug in the `include_router` function is causing the `response.json()` call in the `test_openapi_schema` test to fail. The function iterates through the routes of the provided router and adds them to the current router with certain modifications. However, the issue arises when combining the responses of the routes. It seems that the responses are not being combined correctly, leading to an unexpected result in the `openapi_schema`.

To fix the bug, we should update the `include_router` function to correctly combine the responses from the included router's routes. We should properly merge the responses from each route into a single dictionary and then add them to the existing responses dictionary.

The corrected function is as follows:
```python
def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
    responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    if responses is None:
        responses = {}
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            for status_code, response in route.responses.items():
                if status_code in responses:
                    responses[status_code].update(response)
                else:
                    responses[status_code] = response
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=route.responses,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```

With this correction, the `include_router` function should correctly combine the responses from the routes and the `test_openapi_schema` test should pass as expected.
