The error message is comparing the expected JSON response with the actual JSON response and finding differences in the "responses" key for the paths '/b' and '/c' when defined using a single APIRouter.

The bug is occurring in the `include_router` method, specifically in the code where existing responses are being updated. The issue seems to be with the merging of responses for different paths, as reported in the associated detailed issue description.

To fix the bug, one approach could be to refactor the code of the `include_router` method to properly update and include the responses for each route path. This could involve ensuring that responses are mapped to specific route paths and do not get merged unintentionally.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` method:

```python
def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
    responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            individual_responses = route.responses.copy()  # Create a separate copy of responses for each route
            if responses:
                individual_responses.update(responses)  # Update the individual responses with the shared responses
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=individual_responses,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```

This corrected code ensures that the responses for each route are handled individually and avoid unintended merging of responses for different paths.
