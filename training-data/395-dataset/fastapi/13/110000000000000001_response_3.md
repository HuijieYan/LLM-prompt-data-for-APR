The potential error in the given code is that the variable `responses` is not being properly handled. It is initialized as `None` in the function arguments, but then it is being reassigned inside the loop, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

The reason for the bug is that every time a new route is processed, the `responses` variable is being reassigned by creating a new dictionary with the current route's responses and any existing `responses`. This can lead to the loss of previous responses from other routes.

To fix this bug, we can initialize the `responses` dictionary outside of the loop, and then update it with the responses of each route without reassigning the variable. This way, all the responses from different routes will be properly accumulated.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Union, Any
from fastapi.routing import APIRouter, APIRoute, routing

def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
    responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    if responses is None:
        responses = {}
        
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            responses.update(route.responses)
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=responses,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```
