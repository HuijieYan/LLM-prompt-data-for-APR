Potential error location: The error likely occurs within the `include_router` function, specifically when handling the `responses` parameter. This is evident from the error message, which compares the expected openapi_schema with the actual response.json(), indicating a discrepancy in the responses.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the `responses` are not being properly handled. Inside the `include_router` function, the responses from each route are being merged into a single dictionary without properly accounting for duplicate keys. This causes unexpected behavior in the resulting responses.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Initialize the `responses` dictionary outside of the loop over the routes to prevent duplicate keys.
2. Merge the route responses with the existing `responses` dictionary instead of creating a new dictionary for each route.
3. Ensure that the `responses` dictionary is properly structured and not overwritten with each iteration.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"

    responses = {}
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            responses.update(route.responses)
            
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=responses,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,

                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,

            )
