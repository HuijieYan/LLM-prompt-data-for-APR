The bug occurs in the `include_router` function. When processing the routes in the `router`, the `responses` dictionary is being overwritten for each route, instead of being updated. This leads to only the `responses` of the last route being retained in the final `responses` dictionary.

To fix this bug, the `responses` dictionary should be updated with the responses from each route, rather than being reassigned on each iteration.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` function:

```python
def include_router(
        self,
        router: "APIRouter",
        *,
        prefix: str = "",
        tags: List[str] = None,
        responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
    ) -> None:
        if prefix:
            assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
            assert not prefix.endswith(
                "/"
            ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"

        update_responses = {}
        if responses:
            update_responses = responses.copy()

        for route in router.routes:
            if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
                update_responses.update(route.responses)

                self.add_api_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    response_model=route.response_model,
                    status_code=route.status_code,
                    tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                    summary=route.summary,
                    description=route.description,
                    response_description=route.response_description,
                    responses=update_responses,
                    deprecated=route.deprecated,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    operation_id=route.operation_id,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    content_type=route.content_type,
                    name=route.name,
                )
            elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
                self.add_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    name=route.name,
                )
            elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
                self.add_websocket_route(
                    prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
                )
```
