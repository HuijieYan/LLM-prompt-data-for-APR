The bug in the given function is that the `responses` variable is being overwritten in each iteration of the loop, instead of being combined with the responses from each route.

The `responses` variable is initialized as an empty dictionary at the beginning of the function. However, in each iteration of the loop, it is being reassigned to only the responses of the current route, effectively overwriting the previous responses. This results in the loss of responses from previous routes.

To fix this bug, we should combine the responses from each route instead of overwriting the `responses` variable.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Union, Any
from fastapi.routing import APIRouter, APIRoute

def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
    responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    combined_responses = responses if responses is not None else {}
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            combined_responses = {**combined_responses, **route.responses}
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=combined_responses,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```

In the corrected code, we introduced a new variable `combined_responses` to store the combined responses from each route. This ensures that the responses from all routes are included in the final dictionary.
