The bug occurs in the `include_router` function, where the `responses` dictionary is being shared between routes, causing unexpected behavior.

The issue is likely due to the responses variable being initialized outside of the loop and then used to accumulate responses from different routes. However, this approach is causing the responses to be shared across routes.

To fix the bug, initialize the responses variable inside the loop for each route. This way, responses will be specific to each route and not shared among them.

Here is the corrected code for the `include_router` function:

```python
def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
    responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            combined_responses = responses.copy() if responses else {}
            combined_responses.update(route.responses)
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=combined_responses,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```
