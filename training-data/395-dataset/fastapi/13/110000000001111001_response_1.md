The issue with the buggy function is that the `responses` dictionary is being overwritten in each iteration of the loop. This causes the previously collected responses to be lost. To fix this, we need to move the `responses` initialization outside of the loop, and then we can properly collect and merge the responses from each route.

The corrected code for the `include_router` method is as follows:

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter, APIRoute
from typing import List, Dict, Union, Any

def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
    responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    
    if responses is None:
        responses = {}  # Initialize outside the loop to collect and merge responses
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            responses = {**responses, **route.responses}  # Merge the responses from each route
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=responses,  # Use the merged responses
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```
With this correction, the `responses` dictionary will be properly collected and merged from each route, and none of the previously collected responses will be lost.
