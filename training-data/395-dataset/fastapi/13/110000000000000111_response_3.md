The bug occurs when defining routes with an API router, where their alternative responses are shared. This results in the responses for different paths being merged when included in the same APIRouter instance.

The potential error location within the `include_router` function is the handling of the `responses` dictionary. When iterating through the routes and merging responses, the responses are being combined and shared across different routes.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that each route's responses are kept separate and not shared.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` function:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Union, Any
from fastapi.routing import APIRoute
from fastapi.routing import routing
from fastapi import APIRouter

def include_router(
    self,
    router: APIRouter,
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"

    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            responses = dict(route.responses)  # create a new dictionary for each route's responses
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=responses,  # use the new responses dictionary for this route
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```

In the corrected code, for each route that is being added, a new dictionary `responses` is created with the route's responses. This ensures that each route's responses are separate and not shared.
