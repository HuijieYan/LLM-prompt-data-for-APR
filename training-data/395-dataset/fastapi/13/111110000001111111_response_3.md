The bug occurs in the `include_router` function of the `APIRouter` class. The issue is that when iterating through the routes in the given `router`, the responses are being combined into a single dictionary `responses`, and this combined `responses` dictionary is then used for every route without clearing it for each route.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `responses` dictionary is cleared for each route before adding the responses from that route.

Below is the corrected code for the `include_router` function:

```python
def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
    responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            # Clear the responses for each route
            route_responses = responses.copy() if responses else {}
            route_responses.update(route.responses)
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=route_responses,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```

In the corrected code, we create a new dictionary `route_responses` for each route, copy the contents of `responses` into it (if `responses` is not `None`), and then update `route_responses` with the responses from the current `route`. This ensures that the responses for each route are not shared or combined with other routes.
