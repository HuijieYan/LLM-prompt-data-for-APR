The issue is occurring in the `include_router` method of the `APIRouter` class. When adding routes to the router, the alternative responses are being shared across different routes, causing unexpected behavior.

The bug is happening because the responses dictionary is being shared and accumulated across different routes within the `include_router` method. This causes responses from different routes to be merged and overwritten, resulting in unexpected behavior when defining the routes.

To fix this bug, the responses dictionary for each route should be handled separately and not be shared across routes. One approach to achieve this is to create a new responses dictionary for each route and only merge it with the accumulated responses at the end when adding the route. This ensures that each route has its own separate responses and they are not shared across routes.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` method:

```python
def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
    responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            route_responses = route.responses.copy() if route.responses else {}
            if responses:
                route_responses.update(responses)

            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=route_responses,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```
