The error message suggests that there is an issue with generating the OpenAPI schema for the API routes. The error specifically points to the responses for the paths '/b' and '/c', indicating that the responses are not being merged correctly.

The issue lies in the `include_router` function, and more specifically, in the loop where the responses from the routes are being merged. The bug occurs because the `responses` variable is being reset for each iteration of the loop, rather than being updated with the new responses.

To fix the bug, the `include_router` function needs to correctly merge the responses from the routes and then pass them to the `add_api_route` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` function:

```python
def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
    responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    merged_responses = responses if responses is not None else {}
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            merged_responses = {**merged_responses, **route.responses}
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=merged_responses,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```

In the corrected code, the `merged_responses` variable is used to accumulate the responses from the routes, and it is then passed to the `add_api_route` function. This ensures that the responses are correctly merged and passed to the `add_api_route` function for each route.
