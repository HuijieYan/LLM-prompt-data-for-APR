The error message indicates that there is a mismatch between the expected OpenAPI schema and the actual OpenAPI schema generated by the `include_router` function. This suggests that the `include_router` function is not correctly including the routes defined in the `APIRouter` object, resulting in a mismatch between the expected and actual OpenAPI schemas.

The bug in the `include_router` function is related to how it iterates over the routes of the provided `APIRouter` and adds them to the current router. It fails to properly handle the `responses` parameter and does not include them accurately when adding routes.

To fix the bug, the `include_router` function needs to correctly iterate over the routes of the provided `APIRouter` and add them to the current router. It should also correctly handle the `responses` parameter to ensure that it includes them accurately when adding routes.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` function:

```python
def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
    responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            if responses is None:
                responses = {}
            responses.update(route.responses)
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=responses,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```

In the corrected code, I changed the line `responses = {**responses, **route.responses}` to `responses.update(route.responses)` to properly merge the responses from each route being added. Additionally, I made some adjustments to the concatenation of tags to ensure they are included correctly when adding routes.
