The error message from the test function asserts that the JSON response does not match the expected openapi_schema. This can be caused by a bug in the functionality of the `include_router` method that is not properly handling the alternate responses defined for routes.

The bug is likely due to the `include_router` method not properly handling the responses defined on the router routes. When including a router into the current router using the `include_router` method, the method is supposed to merge the routes and properly handle the responses defined for each path.

To fix the bug, the `include_router` method needs to be updated to merge the route responses correctly without overwriting or sharing the responses for different paths.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` method:

```python
def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
    responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            merged_responses = responses.copy() if responses else {}
            if route.responses:
                for status_code, response in route.responses.items():
                    if status_code in merged_responses:
                        # Merge the responses by updating the existing keys
                        merged_responses[status_code].update(response)
                    else:
                        # Add new responses to the merged_responses
                        merged_responses[status_code] = response
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=merged_responses,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```

In the corrected code, the responses are merged properly by updating the existing response keys or adding new responses to the merged_responses dictionary. This ensures that alternate responses for different paths are properly handled without overwriting or sharing the responses.
