Potential Error Location:
The issue appears to be related to the `include_router` function where responses are being shared between routes defined with the same APIRouter instance.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the `include_router` function is not properly handling the responses from different routes. When an APIRouter includes a new router, the responses are being merged with the existing responses, causing the shared responses issue.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the `include_router` function should handle responses in a way that doesn't allow them to be shared between different routes. One possible approach is to create a new instance of the responses dictionary for each route being added.

Corrected Code:
```python
def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
    responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            route_responses = route.responses
            if responses is not None:
                route_responses = {**responses, **route.responses}
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=route_responses,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```
In the corrected code, each route's responses are handled separately, and a new instance of `route_responses` is created for each route being added. This ensures that the responses are not shared between different routes, fixing the bug described in the issue.
