Potential Error Location:
The error is likely occurring within the for loop that iterates over the routes in the APIRouter. Specifically, the issue may be related to the handling of the route responses while adding API routes.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `responses` dictionary is being shared across different routes added to the APIRouter. As a result, responses from different routes are getting merged, leading to unexpected behavior.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, a new `responses` dictionary should be created for each route within the for loop. This will ensure that the responses for each route are separate and do not get merged with responses from other routes.

Corrected Code:
```python
from typing import List, Dict, Union, Any
from fastapi.routing import APIRoute
from fastapi.dependencies.utils import get_dependant, get_typed_signature
from fastapi import routing

def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
    responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            route_responses = route.responses.copy() if route.responses else {}
            if responses:
                route_responses.update(responses)
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=route_responses,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```

In the corrected code, we create a new `route_responses` dictionary for each route and update it with the global `responses` if it exists. This ensures that the responses for each route are separate and do not get merged with responses from other routes.
