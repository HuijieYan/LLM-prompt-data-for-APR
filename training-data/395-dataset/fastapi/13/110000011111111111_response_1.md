The bug is caused by the usage of a mutable default value in the function definition for the `responses` parameter. This causes the `responses` to be shared between different routes when defining the API router. As a result, the responses are being merged and overwritten in the test case leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the default value for the `responses` parameter should be set to `None`, and a new empty dictionary should be created inside the function if `responses` is `None`.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Union
from fastapi.routing import APIRouter, APIRoute, Route, WebSocketRoute

def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
    responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            if responses is None:
                responses = {}
            combined_responses = {**responses, **route.responses}
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=combined_responses,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```

By making the change to initialize `responses` as an empty dictionary if it is `None`, the bug is fixed and the responses for different paths are no longer merged.
