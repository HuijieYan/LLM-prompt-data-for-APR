Potential Error:
The issue is with the assignment of the 'responses' variable within the loop. Every time the loop iterates, the 'responses' dictionary is being re-initialized to `{}` which causes the responses of previous routes to be overwritten.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the 'responses' dictionary is re-initialized to an empty dictionary within the loop, leading to the loss of responses from previous routes.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, we need to initialize the 'responses' dictionary outside of the loop and then update it with the responses from each route.

Corrected Code:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Union, Any
from fastapi.routing import APIRouter, APIRoute

def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
    responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    
    # Initialize the responses dictionary outside of the loop
    all_responses = responses or {}

    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            # Update the all_responses dictionary with the responses from the current route
            all_responses = {**all_responses, **route.responses}
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=all_responses,  # Use the updated all_responses dictionary
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
