The bug is occurring in the `include_router` function, specifically within the for loop where it iterates over `router.routes`. The bug causes the alternative responses (defined using the `responses` parameter) for different routes to be shared and merged, which is not the expected behavior.

The reason for this bug is that the `responses` dictionary is being merged for all routes, and this merging occurs within the for loop for each route. As a result, the alternative responses for different paths are being combined, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, the `responses` should only be accumulated from the individual routes if a new `responses` dictionary is not provided. If a new `responses` dictionary is provided, it should not combine with the accumulated responses for other routes.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` function:

```python
def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: list[str] = None,
    responses: dict[Union[int, str], dict[str, Any]] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/")
        assert not prefix.endswith("/")

    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            route_responses = route.responses
            if responses is not None:
                route_responses = responses
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=route_responses,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```
