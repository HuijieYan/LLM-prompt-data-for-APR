The error occurs due to the `include_router` method improperly merging responses when routes are defined within the same `APIRouter` instance, leading to unexpected results.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `responses` for different paths are not merged. This can be achieved by modifying the logic of the `include_router` method.

Below is the corrected code for the `include_router` method:

```python
def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            responses = route.responses.copy()  # Create a copy of the route responses
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=responses,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```

In the corrected code, when adding an `APIRoute`, we create a copy of the `route.responses` to avoid sharing the responses between routes. This ensures that responses for different paths are not merged.

By using the `responses=responses` parameter in the `add_api_route` call, we incorporate the copied responses for each route without sharing among different paths, addressing the issue of responses being shared between routes.
