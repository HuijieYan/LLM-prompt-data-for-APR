The error seems to be related to a mismatch between the expected and actual responses in the test case. The expected and actual responses are being compared, and they do not match in terms of the content of the "responses" field.

The potential error location within the `include_router` function is the handling of the `responses` parameter. The function seems to be collecting responses from multiple routes and combining them into a single responses dictionary. However, it is not handling the responses from different routes properly, leading to the mismatch in the test case.

The bug occurs because the `responses` dictionary is being overwritten in each iteration for a new route, instead of properly combining the responses from different routes.

To fix the bug, the `responses` dictionary should be updated in each iteration to include the responses from the current route, without overwriting the existing responses.

The corrected code for the `include_router` function is as follows:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Any, Union
from fastapi import APIRouter
from fastapi.routing import APIRoute

def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
    responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            if responses is None:
                responses = {}
            for status_code, response in route.responses.items():
                if status_code in responses:
                    responses[status_code].update(response)
                else:
                    responses[status_code] = response
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=responses,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```

In the corrected code, the `responses` dictionary is properly updated to include responses from all the routes without overwriting the existing responses. This should fix the bug and make the function work as intended.
