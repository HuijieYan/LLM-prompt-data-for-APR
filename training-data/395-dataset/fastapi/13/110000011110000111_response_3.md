The error message from the test_openapi_schema function indicates that the responses for different paths are being incorrectly merged, leading to unexpected behavior when defining routes with the API router.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line where it iterates through the routes in the router and processes them. The issue arises from how the responses are being handled and merged for each route.

The bug occurs because the responses dictionary is being shared across different routes within the same APIRouter instance. When responses are combined, the responses from previous routes are carried over to subsequent routes, resulting in unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that each route's responses are handled independently without carrying over responses from previous routes.

Here's the corrected code for the include_router function:

```python
from typing import List, Dict, Union, Any
from fastapi import APIRouter, routing, Depends  # Import dependencies as needed

def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, routing.APIRoute):
            responses = route.responses.copy()  # create a copy of the route's responses
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=responses,  # use the copied responses for the route
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```

In the corrected code, we create a copy of the route's responses and use the copied responses for each route, ensuring that they are handled independently and do not carry over responses from previous routes.
