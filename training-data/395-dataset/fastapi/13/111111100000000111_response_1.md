Potential error location: 
The issue occurs in the include_router function, particularly in the loop where it iterates over the routes of the provided APIRouter. Within this loop, the code is adding routes to the main router without properly handling the responses for different paths.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the responses dictionary is being shared between different routes of the APIRouter. When the routes are iterated over and added to the main router using the add_api_route method, the responses dictionary is not being handled properly. As a result, the responses for different paths are being merged, which leads to unexpected behavior as described in the bug report.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, each route's responses dictionary should be handled independently to avoid merging responses from different paths. The responses for each route should be added separately to the main router to ensure they are not shared.

Here's the corrected code for the include_router function:
```python
def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith("/"), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"

    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            new_responses = dict(route.responses) if route.responses else {}
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=new_responses,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,

                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,

        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
