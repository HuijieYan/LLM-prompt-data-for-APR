The potential error in the given function `include_router` is that the `add_api_route` method is being called with more arguments than it can accept. The `add_api_route` method expects `path` and `endpoint` arguments, but it is also being passed additional keyword arguments (`response_model`, `status_code`, `tags`, `summary`, etc.).

This bug occurred because the `add_api_route` method is being called with additional arguments that it is not designed to handle. This is likely a coding mistake where the function signature for `add_api_route` was not updated to handle the additional parameters.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the additional arguments being passed to the `add_api_route` method in the `include_router` function.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
    responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            if responses is None:
                responses = {}
            responses = {**responses, **route.responses}
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint
            )
```
