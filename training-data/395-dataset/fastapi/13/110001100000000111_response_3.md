1. The test case provided demonstrates that when routes with alternative responses are defined with the same APIRouter instance, their responses are shared. This results in incorrect behavior when accessing different paths. The expected behavior is that responses for different paths should not be merged.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the `include_router` method, particularly in the for loop where it processes the routes from the specified router.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `responses` dictionary is being updated and merged for all routes within the `include_router` method. This results in the sharing of responses between routes and the incorrect behavior observed in the test case.

4. To fix the bug, one approach is to modify the `include_router` method to ensure that the responses for different paths are not merged. This can be achieved by creating a separate responses dictionary for each route and then adding it to the `add_api_route` method accordingly.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` method:

```python
def include_router(
        self,
        router: "APIRouter",
        *,
        prefix: str = "",
        tags: List[str] = None,
    ) -> None:
        if prefix:
            assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
            assert not prefix.endswith(
                "/"
            ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
        for route in router.routes:
            if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
                response_dict = route.responses or {}  # Create a new responses dictionary for each route
                self.add_api_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    response_model=route.response_model,
                    status_code=route.status_code,
                    tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                    summary=route.summary,
                    description=route.description,
                    response_description=route.response_description,
                    responses=response_dict,  # Use the separate responses dictionary for each route
                    deprecated=route.deprecated,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    operation_id=route.operation_id,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    content_type=route.content_type,
                    name=route.name,
                )
            elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
                self.add_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    name=route.name,
                )
            elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
                self.add_websocket_route(
                    prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
                )
