The error message suggests that there is a mismatch between the expected and actual JSON response. This indicates that the `include_router` function, particularly the `add_api_route` method called within it, is not adding the expected responses to the routes.

The potential error location is within the loop that iterates over the routes. There seems to be an issue with how the responses are being combined and added to the routes.

The bug occurs because the `responses` dictionary is being reinitialized with each iteration of the loop. This causes the responses to only contain the responses from the last route instead of accumulating all responses from each route.

To fix this bug, you can modify the code to initialize `responses` at the start of the loop instead of inside the loop. Then, for each route, you can accumulate the responses by updating the `responses` dictionary with the responses from the current route.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` function:

```python
def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
    responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith("/"), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    
    if responses is None:
        responses = {}  # Initialize responses if it is None
    
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            responses.update(route.responses)  # Accumulate responses from the current route
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=responses,  # Use the accumulated responses
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```

By initializing `responses` outside the loop and updating it with the responses from each route, the responses for each route will be correctly accumulated and added to the routes.
