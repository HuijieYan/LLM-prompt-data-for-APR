Potential Error Location:
The issue in the code is occurring at the line `responses = {**responses, **route.responses}`. This line overwrites any existing `responses` with `route.responses`, rather than combining them.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the code is reassigning the `responses` variable inside the loop, resulting in the loss of previous responses.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to combine the existing `responses` with `route.responses` instead of overwriting the entire `responses` dictionary.

Corrected Code:
```python
def include_router(
        self,
        router: "APIRouter",
        *,
        prefix: str = "",
        tags: List[str] = None,
        responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
    ) -> None:
        if prefix:
            assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
            assert not prefix.endswith(
                "/"
            ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
        combined_responses = responses.copy() if responses else {}
        for route in router.routes:
            if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
                combined_responses.update(route.responses)
                self.add_api_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
