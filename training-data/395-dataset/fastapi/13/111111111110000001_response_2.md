The error message indicates that there is a mismatch in the responses of the openapi schema returned by the test function and the expected openapi schema. This suggests that there might be an issue with how the responses are being processed and included in the openapi schema.

The potential error location within the include_router function is the way responses are being handled when adding new routes. The bug is that the responses from the new route are being added to a dictionary without properly merging the existing responses. This causes mismatches when comparing the openapi schema.

The bug occurs because the responses from the new route are simply being merged into the responses dictionary without taking into account the existing responses. This leads to incorrect responses being included in the openapi schema.

One approach to fixing this bug is to properly merge the existing responses with the new responses. This can be achieved by iterating through the new responses and adding them to the existing responses dictionary, while ensuring that any existing responses are not overwritten.

Here's the corrected code for the include_router function:

```python
def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
    responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            if responses is None:
                responses = {}
            for code, response in route.responses.items():
                if code in responses:
                    # Merge with existing response
                    responses[code] = {**responses[code], **response}
                else:
                    responses[code] = response
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,

            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
