The bug seems to be in the `include_router` function where the `responses` dictionary is being overwritten in every iteration of the loop, causing the responses to be merged multiple times. This results in unexpected behavior when comparing the response with the `openapi_schema` in the `test_openapi_schema` test function.

To fix the bug, we need to merge the responses of each route properly and update the `responses` dictionary outside of the loop, rather than inside it.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Any, Dict, List, Union
from fastapi.routing import APIRoute

def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
    responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    combined_responses = responses.copy() if responses else {}
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            combined_responses.update(route.responses)
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=combined_responses,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        # (similar for other route types)
```

With this modification, the `responses` are now correctly merged without overwriting any existing values. This should fix the issue observed in the `test_openapi_schema` function.
