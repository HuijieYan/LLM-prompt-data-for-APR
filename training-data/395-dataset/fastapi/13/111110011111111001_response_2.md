The error message from the test function indicates that the `responses` dictionary in the OpenAPI schema is not as expected. It seems that when combining responses from different routes in the `include_router` function, the responses are not being merged correctly.

The potential error location within the `include_router` function is the logic for combining responses from different routes. It seems that the responses are being overridden instead of being merged.

The bug occurs because when combining responses from different routes, the `responses` dictionary is being overridden instead of being merged with the existing responses.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for combining responses. Instead of overriding the `responses` dictionary, we should merge the responses from different routes by updating the existing `responses` dictionary with the responses from each route.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` function:

```python
def include_router(
    self,
    router: "APIRouter",
    *,
    prefix: str = "",
    tags: List[str] = None,
    responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"

    if responses is None:
        responses = {}

    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            combined_responses = responses.copy()
            combined_responses.update(route.responses)

            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                responses=combined_responses,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
            )
```

In the corrected code, I have added a new variable `combined_responses` to merge the responses from different routes. This ensures that the responses are correctly combined and updated, instead of being overridden.
