The issue seems to be related to the `add_api_websocket_route` function not adding the `dependency_overrides_provider` to the `APIWebSocketRoute`, which prevents the overrides from being taken into account.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely at the point where the `APIWebSocketRoute` is created and added to `self.routes`. It seems that the `dependency_overrides_provider` is not being passed to the `APIWebSocketRoute`.

To fix this issue, the `dependency_overrides_provider` needs to be added to the `APIWebSocketRoute`. This can be achieved by modifying the `add_api_websocket_route` function as follows:

```python
from fastapi.routing import APIWebSocketRoute
from typing import Callable

def add_api_websocket_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None, dependency_overrides_provider=None
) -> None:
    route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependency_overrides_provider=dependency_overrides_provider)
    self.routes.append(route)
```

By adding the `dependency_overrides_provider` parameter to the `add_api_websocket_route` function and passing it to the `APIWebSocketRoute` when creating a new route, we ensure that the overrides are taken into account for websockets.

This modified function should resolve the issue of dependency overrides not working for websockets.
