The issue is occurring because the `add_api_websocket_route` function is not properly incorporating the `dependency_overrides_provider` when creating an `APIWebSocketRoute`.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `add_api_websocket_route` function to pass the `dependency_overrides_provider` to the `APIWebSocketRoute` constructor.

Here's the corrected function code:

```python
def add_api_websocket_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
) -> None:
    route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependency_overrides_provider=self.dependency_overrides_provider)
    self.routes.append(route)
```

By including `dependency_overrides_provider=self.dependency_overrides_provider` in the `APIWebSocketRoute` constructor, we ensure that the dependency overrides are properly passed to the websocket routes.

This should address the issue reported in the test case and the associated GitHub issue.
