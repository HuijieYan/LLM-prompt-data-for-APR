The bug occurs in the add_api_websocket_route function where an APIWebSocketRoute is created and added to the routes list, but the dependency_overrides_provider is not being passed to the APIWebSocketRoute.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the add_api_websocket_route function to accept the dependency_overrides_provider parameter and pass it to the APIWebSocketRoute.

Here's the corrected add_api_websocket_route function:

```python
from typing import Callable
from fastapi.routing import APIWebSocketRoute

def add_api_websocket_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, dependency_overrides_provider, name: str = None
) -> None:
    route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependency_overrides_provider=dependency_overrides_provider)
    self.routes.append(route)
```

With this modification, the dependency_overrides_provider will be included when creating the APIWebSocketRoute, and it should resolve the issue of dependency override not working for websockets.
