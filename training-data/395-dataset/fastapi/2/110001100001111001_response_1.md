The problem with the provided function is that it is trying to append a new route to the `self.routes` list, but the `self.routes` attribute is already initialized with a different type of routes (e.g., `WebSocketRoute` objects). This causes a type error.

To fix this issue, we can create a new list containing the existing routes and the new route, and then assign this new list to the `self.routes` attribute.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def add_api_websocket_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
) -> None:
    new_route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name)
    self.routes = self.routes + [new_route]
```
