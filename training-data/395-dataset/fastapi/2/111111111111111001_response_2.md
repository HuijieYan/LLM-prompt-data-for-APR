The error in the `add_api_websocket_route` function is that it appends the `route` object to `self.routes` regardless of the value of `name`. This results in incorrectly adding routes to `self.routes` and it doesn't take into account the specific route name specified by the `name` parameter.

The buggy function adds the `route` object to `self.routes` without checking if a route with the same name already exists. This can cause duplicate routes with the same path but different names.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `add_api_websocket_route` function to check if a route with the same name already exists. If it does, it should update the route with the new endpoint and path. If it doesn't exist, it should add a new route.

Here's the corrected code for the `add_api_websocket_route` function:

```python
from typing import Callable
from fastapi.routing import APIRouter, APIWebSocketRoute

class APIRouter(routing.Router):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def add_api_websocket_route(
        self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
    ) -> None:
        existing_route = next((r for r in self.routes if r.name == name), None)
        if existing_route:
            existing_route.path = path
            existing_route.endpoint = endpoint
        else:
            route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name)
            self.routes.append(route)
```

With this correction, the function checks if a route with the same name already exists. If it does, it updates the route with the new endpoint and path. If it doesn't exist, it adds a new route to `self.routes`. This should prevent the occurrence of duplicate routes with the same path but different names.

This correction should address the issue encountered in the test function and prevent the addition of duplicate routes.
