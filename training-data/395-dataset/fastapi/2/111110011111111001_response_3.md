The error occurs because the `add_api_websocket_route` function is creating and adding an `APIWebSocketRoute` object to the `routes` list, but the WebSocket route matching the test case is not being properly overridden.

The bug lies in the `add_api_websocket_route` function not properly utilizing the `name` parameter. This results in the WebSocket route not being overridden as expected in the test case.

To fix the function, it should properly utilize the `name` parameter and ensure that it is being used for WebSocket route matching when adding the route to the `routes` list.

Here's the corrected code for the `add_api_websocket_route` function:

```python
class APIRouter(routing.Router):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def add_api_websocket_route(
        self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
    ) -> None:
        route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name)
        # the route matching should be updated using the provided name
        self.routes.insert(0, route)  # Insert at the beginning to give higher priority for matching
```

By utilizing the `name` parameter and inserting the new route at the beginning of the `routes` list, it ensures that the correct WebSocket route will be matched, addressing the issues seen in the test case.
