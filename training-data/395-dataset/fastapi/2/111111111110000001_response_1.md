The error message suggests that the test is expecting the value "Override" but receiving "Socket Dependency" instead. This indicates that there is a problem with the dependency override within the WebSocket route.

Looking at the provided code, the issue is likely with the implementation of the `add_api_websocket_route` method in the `APIRouter` class. It seems that the `APIWebSocketRoute` is not properly handling the dependency overrides, which is causing the test failure.

To fix this issue, the `add_api_websocket_route` method needs to be modified to properly handle dependency overrides for WebSocket routes.

Here's the corrected `add_api_websocket_route` method:

```python
from fastapi.websockets import WebSocket

class APIRouter(routing.Router):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def add_api_websocket_route(
        self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None, dependencies: list = []
    ) -> None:
        async def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket):
            for dependency in self.depends:
                dependency_override = app.dependency_overrides.get(dependency)
                if dependency_override:
                    # Call the dependency override if available
                    await dependency_override(websocket)
                else:
                    # Call the original dependency
                    await dependency(websocket)

        route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=websocket_endpoint, name=name)
        self.routes.append(route)
```

In this corrected version, the `add_api_websocket_route` method now accepts a list of dependencies. Inside the method, a new `websocket_endpoint` is defined, which loops through the dependencies and checks for overrides using `app.dependency_overrides.get(dependency)`. If an override is found, it calls the override, otherwise, it calls the original dependency.

This correction allows the WebSocket routes to properly handle dependency overrides, addressing the issue experienced in the test case.
