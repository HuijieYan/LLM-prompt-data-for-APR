Potential error location:
The issue seems to be related to the websocket connection receiving "Socket Dependency" instead of "Override", which is expected.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug is likely in the `add_api_websocket_route` function. It seems that this function is not properly defining a websocket route that could potentially affect the websocket dependency override.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
The `add_api_websocket_route` function should be updated to properly define the websocket route and handle dependencies. Additionally, the websocket dependency override should be handled correctly in the test function.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Callable
from fastapi.routing import APIWebSocketRoute

def add_api_websocket_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None, dependencies=None
) -> None:
    route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependencies=dependencies)
    self.routes.append(route)
```
