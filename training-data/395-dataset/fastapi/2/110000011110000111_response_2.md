The error message indicates that the test is expecting the websocket to receive "Override", but it actually receives "Socket Dependency". This suggests that the dependency_override is not being applied to the websocket connection as expected.

The potential error location within the add_api_websocket_route function is that it is not handling the dependency overrides, resulting in the original dependency being used instead of the overridden one.

The reason for the bug is that the add_api_websocket_route function does not take into account the dependency overrides when creating the APIWebSocketRoute.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the add_api_websocket_route function to consider the dependency overrides when creating the APIWebSocketRoute.

Here's the corrected add_api_websocket_route function:

```python
from typing import Callable, Optional
from fastapi.websockets import APIWebSocketRoute

# corrected function
def add_api_websocket_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None, dependency_overrides_provider: Optional[dict] = None
) -> None:
    route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependency_overrides_provider=dependency_overrides_provider)
    self.routes.append(route)
```

With this correction, the add_api_websocket_route function now takes an additional parameter `dependency_overrides_provider`, which allows the passing of dependency overrides to the APIWebSocketRoute. This will ensure that the overridden dependencies are used when creating websockets, resolving the issue described in the error message.
