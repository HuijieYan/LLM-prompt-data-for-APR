Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the provided function seems to be with the `APIWebSocketRoute` class or the `self.routes` attribute where the `route` is being appended.

Reason for the Bug:
The error message from the test function indicates that the websocket is receiving 'Socket Dependency' instead of 'Override', which suggests that the websocket is not being overridden as expected. This points to a potential issue with the `add_api_websocket_route` method not properly handling dependency overrides for websockets.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
In order to fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `add_api_websocket_route` method properly handles dependency overrides for websockets. This may involve checking and properly applying dependency overrides within the method.

Corrected Code:
```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class APIRouter(routing.Router):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def add_api_websocket_route(
        self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
    ) -> None:
        route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name)
        if hasattr(self, 'dependency_overrides') and callable(getattr(self, 'dependency_overrides', None)):
            endpoint = self.dependency_overrides.get(endpoint, endpoint)
        self.routes.append(route)
```
