The bug in the `add_api_websocket_route` function seems to be caused by not properly adding a new `APIWebSocketRoute` to the `self.routes` list. The function is creating the `APIWebSocketRoute` object correctly but not appending it to the `self.routes` list.

To fix this bug, we need to simply append the new `APIWebSocketRoute` object to the `self.routes` list.

Here's the corrected code for the `add_api_websocket_route` function:

```python
def add_api_websocket_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
) -> None:
    route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name)
    self.routes.append(route)
```

With this correction, the `APIWebSocketRoute` object will be properly added to the `self.routes` list.
