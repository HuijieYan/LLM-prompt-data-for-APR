1. The test case is attempting to override a dependency for a websocket connection, but the override does not seem to be effective, leading to an assertion error.

2. The potential error location within the buggy function is the `add_api_websocket_route` method, which is not properly handling the dependency override.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `add_api_websocket_route` method is not incorporating the dependency overrides, causing the original dependency to be used instead of the overridden one when establishing the websocket connection.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the `add_api_websocket_route` method to include the dependency overrides when creating the APIWebSocketRoute.
   - Ensure that the APIWebSocketRoute uses the overridden dependencies instead of the original ones.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
class APIRouter(routing.Router):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def add_api_websocket_route(
        self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None, dependency_overrides: Dict = None
    ) -> None:
        route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependency_overrides=dependency_overrides)
        self.routes.append(route)
```

In the corrected code, the `add_api_websocket_route` method now includes a `dependency_overrides` parameter, allowing the user to pass in any dependency overrides. The `APIWebSocketRoute` is then created with the specified dependency overrides. This ensures that the overridden dependencies are used when establishing the websocket connection.
