The potential error in the provided function is that it is not updating the `self.routes` list with the new route that is being appended. This is leading to the inconsistency between the expected and actual values for `self.routes`.

To fix this bug, the function should update the `self.routes` list with the newly created `route` object.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def add_api_websocket_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
) -> None:
    route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name)
    self.routes.append(route)
```
With this corrected code, the `self.routes` list will be updated to include the newly added route, resolving the inconsistency between expected and actual values.
