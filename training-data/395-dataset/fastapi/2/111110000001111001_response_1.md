Potential Error Location: The buggy function `add_api_websocket_route` is not correctly adding the route to the `APIRouter` object's `routes` attribute.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The function is not adding the `APIWebSocketRoute` object to the `routes` attribute of the `APIRouter` object.
2. The `routes` attribute should contain a list of routes, but the function is not correctly appending the new route to the list.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the `append` method to add the new route to the existing list of routes in the `APIRouter`.
2. Ensure that the type of the `self.routes` attribute matches the type of the `route` being added.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class APIRouter(routing.Router):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def add_api_websocket_route(
        self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
    ) -> None:
        route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name)
        if not isinstance(self.routes, list):
            self.routes = []
        self.routes.append(route)
```
