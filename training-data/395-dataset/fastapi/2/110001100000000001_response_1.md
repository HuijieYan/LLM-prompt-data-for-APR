Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the `self.routes.append(route)` line in the `add_api_websocket_route` function. It is likely that `self.routes` is not defined or initialized, resulting in an AttributeError.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The `self.routes` attribute is not initialized or defined within the `add_api_websocket_route` function, which leads to the AttributeError when trying to append `route` to it.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Initialize the `self.routes` attribute (if it's a list) outside of the `add_api_websocket_route` function, possibly in the class constructor or another appropriate place.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/fastapi_2/fastapi/routing.py

# corrected function
def add_api_websocket_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
) -> None:
    # Assuming self.routes is a list attribute of the class
    if not hasattr(self, 'routes'):
        self.routes = []  # Initialize self.routes if it doesn't exist
    route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name)
    self.routes.append(route)
```
