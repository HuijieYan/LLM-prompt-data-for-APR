Potential error location:
The issue seems to be with the addition of a new APIWebSocketRoute to the existing list of routes.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the function is not actually updating the `self.routes` attribute of the APIRouter object. Instead, it is simply appending the new APIWebSocketRoute to the local variable `routes`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the function needs to update the `self.routes` attribute of the APIRouter object rather than appending the new APIWebSocketRoute to a local variable.

Corrected code:

```python
def add_api_websocket_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
) -> None:
    route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name)
    self.routes.append(route)
    # Update the routes attribute of the APIRouter object
    setattr(self, "routes", self.routes)
```
