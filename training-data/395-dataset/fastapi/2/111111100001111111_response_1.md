The bug is occurring in the `add_api_websocket_route` function of the `APIRouter` class. The issue is related to the `dependency_overrides_provider` not being added to the `APIWebSocketRoute` when the route is created.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `add_api_websocket_route` function to include the `dependency_overrides_provider` when creating the `APIWebSocketRoute`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def add_api_websocket_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
) -> None:
    route = APIWebSocketRoute(
        path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependency_overrides_provider=self.dependency_overrides_provider
    )
    self.routes.append(route)
```

By adding the `dependency_overrides_provider` parameter to the creation of the `APIWebSocketRoute`, we ensure that the dependency overrides are taken into account for websockets as well. This should resolve the issue with dependency override not working for websockets.
