Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the given function is the append operation on the 'routes' attribute of the 'self' object. It seems like 'routes' attribute is not being correctly initialized as a list in some cases, leading to a type mismatch when trying to append an APIWebSocketRoute object to it.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the 'routes' attribute of the 'self' object is not consistently initialized as a list. In some cases, it contains WebSocketRoute objects, which causes a type mismatch when trying to append an APIWebSocketRoute object.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Initialize the 'routes' attribute of the 'self' object as an empty list when it is created, to ensure that it is always a list and ready to accept APIWebSocketRoute objects.

2. Check the type of the 'routes' attribute in the '__init__' method of the class and make sure it is always set to a list.

3. If the 'routes' attribute can contain different types of routes, consider using a more generic superclass for all route types to allow for a more flexible implementation.

Corrected Code:
```python
class APIRouter:
    def __init__(self):
        self.routes = []

    def add_api_websocket_route(
        self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
    ) -> None:
        route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name)
        self.routes.append(route)
```
