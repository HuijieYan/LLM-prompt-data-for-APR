The error occurs in the function `add_api_websocket_route`, where it should add the `dependency_overrides_provider` to the `APIWebSocketRoute` but it doesn't. This causes the dependency overrides not to be taken into account when testing with websockets.

To fix the bug, the `add_api_websocket_route` function needs to be updated to include the `dependency_overrides_provider` in the `APIWebSocketRoute` when creating a new route.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class APIRouter(routing.Router):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the fixed function
    def add_api_websocket_route(
        self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
    ) -> None:
        route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependency_overrides_provider=self.dependency_overrides_provider)
        self.routes.append(route)
```
