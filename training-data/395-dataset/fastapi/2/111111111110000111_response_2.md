Based on the error message and the provided information, it seems that the bug is related to the dependency override not being applied to the websockets.

The potential error location is within the add_api_websocket_route function, where the dependency overrides are not being passed to the APIWebSocketRoute.

The reason behind the bug is that the add_api_websocket_route function does not handle the dependency overrides when creating the APIWebSocketRoute.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the add_api_websocket_route function to accept dependency overrides and pass them to the APIWebSocketRoute.

Here's the corrected code for the add_api_websocket_route function:

```python
def add_api_websocket_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None, dependencies: List[Depends] = []
) -> None:
    route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependencies=dependencies)
    self.routes.append(route)
```

In this corrected code, the add_api_websocket_route function now accepts a list of dependencies, which includes the dependency overrides. This list of dependencies is then passed to the APIWebSocketRoute when it is created.

With these changes, the dependency overrides should now be properly applied to the websockets, resolving the bug related to dependency override not working for websockets.
