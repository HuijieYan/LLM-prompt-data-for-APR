The issue seems to be related to the `add_api_websocket_route` function not properly handling the `dependency_overrides_provider` for `APIWebSocketRoute`. This leads to the WebSocket dependency not being properly overridden when the `dependency_overrides` are set in the FastAPI app.

To fix this bug, the `add_api_websocket_route` function needs to be updated to properly handle the `dependency_overrides_provider`. We need to ensure that the dependency overrides are correctly propagated to the `APIWebSocketRoute`.

Here's the corrected code for the `add_api_websocket_route` function:

```python
from fastapi.dependencies.utils import get_dependant_fastapi_websocket

def add_api_websocket_route(
        self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None, dependency_overrides_provider=None
) -> None:
    route = APIWebSocketRoute(
        path,
        endpoint=endpoint,
        name=name,
        dependency_overrides_provider=dependency_overrides_provider
    )
    handler = route.handler
    dependant = get_dependant_fastapi_websocket(handler)
    self.routes.append(route)
```

This corrected code includes an additional `dependency_overrides_provider` parameter in the function signature and ensures that the `dependency_overrides_provider` is properly handled when creating the `APIWebSocketRoute`.

With this corrected code, the issue with dependency overrides for WebSocket routes should be resolved, and the associated test case should pass without any assertion errors.
