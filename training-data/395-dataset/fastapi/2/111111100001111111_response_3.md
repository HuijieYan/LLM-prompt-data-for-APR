The bug occurs in the `add_api_websocket_route` method of the `APIRouter` class. The problematic behavior stems from the fact that the `add_api_websocket_route` method does not take the `dependency_overrides_provider` into account when creating an `APIWebSocketRoute`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `add_api_websocket_route` method to add the `dependency_overrides_provider` to the created `APIWebSocketRoute`. Here's the corrected code for the method:

```python
class APIRouter(routing.Router):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def add_api_websocket_route(
        self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
    ) -> None:
        route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependency_overrides_provider=self.dependency_overrides_provider)
        self.routes.append(route)
```

By adding the `dependency_overrides_provider=self.dependency_overrides_provider` parameter when creating an `APIWebSocketRoute`, we ensure that the dependency overrides are taken into account for WebSocket routes.

This fix addresses the bug where the dependency overrides were not being used for WebSocket routes.
