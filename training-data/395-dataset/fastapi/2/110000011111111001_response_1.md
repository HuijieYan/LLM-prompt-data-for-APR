The error in the buggy function is that it is not properly creating an instance of the APIWebSocketRoute and adding it to the routes list. This leads to incorrect handling of websocket connections and overrides.

Based on the test case and the error message, it seems that the buggy function is not properly handling the dependency overrides for websocket connections. The test case is trying to override a dependency called "ws_dependency", but the buggy function is not handling this override correctly.

To fix this bug, the buggy function should properly handle the dependency overrides for websocket routes.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
from fastapi.routing import APIWebSocketRoute
from typing import Callable

def add_api_websocket_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None, dependencies=None
) -> None:
    route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependencies=dependencies)
    self.routes.append(route)
```

In the corrected code, a new parameter "dependencies" has been added to the function signature, and it is also used to pass any dependencies required for the websocket route. This will allow the function to handle dependency overrides correctly.

By adding support for dependencies in the websocket routes, the corrected function should now properly handle the dependency overrides for websocket connections and resolve the error in the test case.
