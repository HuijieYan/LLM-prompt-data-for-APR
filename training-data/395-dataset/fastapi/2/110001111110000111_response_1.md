Potential error location: The issue seems to be related to the dependency override not working for websockets due to the add_api_websocket_route function not adding dependency_overrides_provider to APIWebSocketRoute.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The add_api_websocket_route function is not properly adding the dependency overrides to APIWebSocketRoute, causing the test to use the original dependency instead of the overridden one.

Approach for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, we need to modify the add_api_websocket_route function to properly handle dependency overrides for APIWebSocketRoute.

Corrected function:

```python
from typing import Callable
from fastapi.routing import APIWebSocketRoute

def add_api_websocket_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
) -> None:
    route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name)
    route.dependency_overrides_provider = self.dependency_overrides_provider  # Add dependency overrides
    self.routes.append(route)
```

In the corrected function, we are assigning the dependency_overrides_provider from the current scope to the APIWebSocketRoute, allowing it to use the overridden dependencies. This should ensure that the dependency overrides are taken into account when using websockets.
