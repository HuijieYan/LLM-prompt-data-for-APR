The potential error in the 'add_api_websocket_route' function is that it is not importing the 'routing' module and 'Callable' type. Additionally, the 'APIWebSocketRoute' class needs to be imported.

The error occurs because the 'routing' module and 'Callable' type are not imported, and the 'APIWebSocketRoute' class is not defined.

To fix this, we need to import the 'routing' module, 'Callable' type, and the 'APIWebSocketRoute' class at the beginning of the file.

Here's the corrected code for the 'add_api_websocket_route' function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/fastapi_2/fastapi/routing.py

from typing import Callable
from .websocket import APIWebSocketRoute  # assuming APIWebSocketRoute is defined in websocket module

# class declaration containing the corrected function
class APIRouter(routing.Router):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def add_api_websocket_route(
        self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
    ) -> None:
        route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name)
        self.routes.append(route)
```

In the corrected code:
- we import the 'Callable' type from the 'typing' module.
- we import the 'APIWebSocketRoute' class assuming it is defined in the 'websocket' module.
- We can then use the 'APIWebSocketRoute' class to create a new route and append it to the list of routes.
