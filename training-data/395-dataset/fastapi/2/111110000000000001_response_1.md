# Corrected function source code
```python
# class declaration containing the fixed function
class APIRouter(routing.Router):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def add_api_websocket_route(
        self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
    ) -> None:
        route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint, name=name)
        self.routes.append(route)
```

The potential error in the original function is with the `APIWebSocketRoute` instantiation. The original code was using `endpoint=endpoint` which is incorrect because it is missing the parameter name. The third parameter should be passed as `name=name` instead. 

This bug occurred because the original code had a syntax error by not specifying the parameter name when instantiating the `APIWebSocketRoute` class.

The corrected code fixes the bug by passing the parameters in the correct order `path, endpoint, name` when instantiating the `APIWebSocketRoute` class.
