The bug is occurring in the `add_api_websocket_route` method of the `APIRouter` class. The function is not adding the `dependency_overrides_provider` to the `APIWebSocketRoute`, causing the override to not work for websockets.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the `dependency_overrides_provider` is added to the `APIWebSocketRoute`.

Here is the corrected code for the `add_api_websocket_route` method:

```python
def add_api_websocket_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
) -> None:
    route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependency_overrides_provider=self.dependency_overrides_provider)
    self.routes.append(route)
```

By adding the `dependency_overrides_provider` to the `APIWebSocketRoute` during its creation, the bug is fixed and the dependency override should work for websockets as expected.
