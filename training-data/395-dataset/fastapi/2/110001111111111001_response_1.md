The provided code is a method to add an API WebSocket route. The bug seems to be in adding the route to the list of routes.

The bug is causing the websocket dependency to be incorrectly overridden, resulting in the assertion error in the test case.

Potential error location:
The potential error location within the problematic function is the incorrect addition of the websocket route.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The buggy code is not adding the APIWebSocketRoute to the list of routes correctly, which is causing the websocket dependency to be incorrectly overridden. As a result, the assertion in the test case fails.

Approach for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the APIWebSocketRoute needs to be added to the list of routes by using the correct method to append it.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def add_api_websocket_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
) -> None:
    route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name)
    self.routes.extend([route])
```

By using the extend method instead of append, the APIWebSocketRoute is correctly added to the list of routes. This should resolve the issue with the websocket dependency override and the assertion error in the test case.
