The issue seems to be related to the `add_api_websocket_route` function not correctly adding the `dependency_overrides_provider` to the `APIWebSocketRoute`. This is causing the test to fail as it's not using the overridden dependency as expected.

The bug occurs in the `add_api_websocket_route` function. The `dependency_overrides_provider` is not being added to the `APIWebSocketRoute` when the route is created.

To fix the bug, the `add_api_websocket_route` function needs to be updated to add the `dependency_overrides_provider` to the `APIWebSocketRoute` when the route is created.

Here is the corrected code for the `add_api_websocket_route` function:

```python
class APIRouter(routing.Router):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def add_api_websocket_route(
        self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
    ) -> None:
        route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependency_overrides_provider=self.dependency_overrides_provider)
        self.routes.append(route)
```

With this correction, the `dependency_overrides_provider` will be correctly added to the `APIWebSocketRoute` when the route is created, and the test should now use the overridden dependency as expected.
