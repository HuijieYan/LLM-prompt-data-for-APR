The error in the code seems to be related to the websocket dependency being overridden, but the websocket is not receiving the expected text.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `add_api_websocket_route` method where the route is being added.

The bug occurred because the `add_api_websocket_route` method is not correctly constructing the `APIWebSocketRoute` object. It does not correctly handle the dependency overrides for websockets.

To fix the bug, the `add_api_websocket_route` method should be updated to handle dependency overrides for websocket routes.

Here's the corrected code for the `add_api_websocket_route` method:

```python
# corrected function
def add_api_websocket_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None, dependencies: List[Depends] = []
) -> None:
    route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependencies=dependencies)
    self.routes.append(route)
```

In this corrected code, an additional parameter `dependencies` of type `List[Depends]` is added to the method, allowing for explicit handling of dependencies for the websocket routes.

By providing this additional parameter, the `add_api_websocket_route` method can better handle dependency overrides for websocket routes.
