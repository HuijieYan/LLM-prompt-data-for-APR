The error occurs because the `add_api_websocket_route` function does not take into account the dependency overrides provided by the FastAPI application when creating a new `APIWebSocketRoute`. This results in the original dependency being used instead of the overridden one when handling websocket connections.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `add_api_websocket_route` function to include the `dependency_overrides_provider` when creating a new `APIWebSocketRoute`.

Here is the corrected code for the `add_api_websocket_route` function:

```python
class APIRouter(routing.Router):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def add_api_websocket_route(
        self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
    ) -> None:
        route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependency_overrides_provider=self.dependency_overrides_provider)
        self.routes.append(route)
```

By including `dependency_overrides_provider=self.dependency_overrides_provider` when creating a new `APIWebSocketRoute`, it ensures that the dependency overrides provided by the FastAPI application are taken into account when handling websocket connections.

This correction will address the bug and allow the `test_router_ws_depends_with_override` test case to work as expected, using the overridden dependency as intended.
