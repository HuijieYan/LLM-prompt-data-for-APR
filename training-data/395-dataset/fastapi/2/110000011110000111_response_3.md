The error occurs in the `test_router_ws_depends_with_override` test function. When the `websocket.receive_text()` is called, it is expected to return "Override", but instead, it returns "Socket Dependency", which indicates that the dependency override is not working for websockets.

The potential error is in the `add_api_websocket_route` function. It seems that when creating an APIWebSocketRoute, the `dependency_overrides_provider` is not being added to the route, causing the overrides to not take effect.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `add_api_websocket_route` function to include the `dependency_overrides_provider` when creating the route.

Below is the corrected code for the `add_api_websocket_route` function:

```python
# corrected function
def add_api_websocket_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, dependency_overrides_provider: Optional[Callable] = None, name: str = None
) -> None:
    route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, dependency_overrides_provider=dependency_overrides_provider, name=name)
    self.routes.append(route)
```

In the corrected code, we added the `dependency_overrides_provider` parameter to the function and included it when creating the APIWebSocketRoute. This change allows the dependency overrides to be added to the websocket route, resolving the issue with dependency override not working for websockets.
