The buggy function `add_api_websocket_route` is supposed to add a new APIWebSocketRoute to the `routes` list of the APIRouter. However, the issue is that it is not creating the APIWebSocketRoute object correctly and not assigning the provided `name` parameter.

The buggy function is not properly creating the APIWebSocketRoute object and not handling the `name` parameter. The `add_api_websocket_route` function should create a new APIWebSocketRoute with the provided `path`, `endpoint`, and `name`, and then append it to the `routes` list.

Here's the corrected code for the `add_api_websocket_route` function:

```python
class APIRouter(routing.Router):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def add_api_websocket_route(
        self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
    ) -> None:
        route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name)
        self.routes.append(route)
```

In this corrected code, the `APIWebSocketRoute` object is created with the provided `path`, `endpoint`, and `name`, and then it is appended to the `routes` list. This will ensure that the `name` parameter is properly handled and the APIWebSocketRoute is added to the list of routes as expected. This should fix the bug.
