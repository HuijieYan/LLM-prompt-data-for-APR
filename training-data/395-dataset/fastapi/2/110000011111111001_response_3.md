The error message from the test function indicates that there is an issue with the websocket connection receiving unexpected data.

The potential error in the code lies in the `add_api_websocket_route` function. The issue seems to be related to the creation of the route object and appending it to the `self.routes` list. The `APIWebSocketRoute` objects are being created correctly, but there might be an issue with how they are being appended to the `self.routes` list.

The bug may be occurring because when the `APIWebSocketRoute` object is being appended to the `self.routes` list, it is not being properly handled or identified by the websocket connection, causing the unexpected data received error in the test.

To fix the bug, you can ensure that the `APIWebSocketRoute` object is being handled correctly when it is appended to the `self.routes` list. Additionally, it's important to verify that the websocket connection is properly receiving the expected data.

Here's the corrected code for the `add_api_websocket_route` function:

```python
def add_api_websocket_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
) -> None:
    route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name)
    self.routes.extend([route])
```

This corrected code uses the `extend` method to add the `APIWebSocketRoute` object to the `self.routes` list, ensuring that each element is added as a single element rather than adding the entire object. This should fix the bug and ensure that the websocket connections are handled correctly.
