The issue is with the function add_api_websocket_route not adding dependency_overrides_provider to the APIWebSocketRoute, leading to dependency overrides not being taken into account for websockets.

To fix this issue, the add_api_websocket_route function needs to be updated to pass the dependency_overrides_provider to the APIWebSocketRoute.

Here's the corrected code for the add_api_websocket_route function:

```python
from typing import Callable
from fastapi.routing import APIWebSocketRoute
from fastapi.routing import APIRouter

def add_api_websocket_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
) -> None:
    route = APIWebSocketRoute(
        path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependency_overrides_provider=self.dependency_overrides_provider
    )
    self.routes.append(route)
```

By adding the `dependency_overrides_provider=self.dependency_overrides_provider` parameter to the APIWebSocketRoute constructor, the dependency overrides will be taken into account for websockets, resolving the issue with dependency override not working for websockets.
