The bug occurs in the add_api_websocket_route function, where it is supposed to add a new APIWebSocketRoute to the routes list, but it doesn't take into account the dependency overrides.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the add_api_websocket_route function to take into account the dependency_overrides_provider when creating a new APIWebSocketRoute.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
from typing import Callable
from fastapi.routing import APIWebSocketRoute

def add_api_websocket_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
) -> None:
    route = APIWebSocketRoute(
        path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependency_overrides_provider=self.dependency_overrides_provider
    )
    self.routes.append(route)
```

In the corrected code, we have added the dependency_overrides_provider as a parameter when initializing the APIWebSocketRoute, so it will take into account the dependency overrides when creating a new route.

This should resolve the issue of dependency override not working for websockets in the FastAPI application.
