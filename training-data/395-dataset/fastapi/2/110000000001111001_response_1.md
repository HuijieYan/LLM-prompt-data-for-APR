The potential error in the provided function is that it is creating a new `APIWebSocketRoute` object and appending it to the `routes` list, but it is not updating the `name` attribute of the `APIWebSocketRoute` object with the provided `name` parameter.

The bug occurs because the `name` parameter is not being used to update the `name` attribute of the `APIWebSocketRoute` object. This causes the `name` attribute to remain as `None` even if a `name` parameter is provided.

To fix the bug, the `name` parameter should be used to update the `name` attribute of the `APIWebSocketRoute` object before appending it to the `routes` list.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from typing import Callable

def add_api_websocket_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
) -> None:
    route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name)
    route.name = name  # Update the name attribute with the provided name parameter
    self.routes.append(route)
```
