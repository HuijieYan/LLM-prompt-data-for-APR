The bug occurs in the add_api_websocket_route function, where it creates a new APIWebSocketRoute but does not add the dependency_overrides_provider to it.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the add_api_websocket_route function to include the dependency_overrides_provider when creating a new APIWebSocketRoute.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def add_api_websocket_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
) -> None:
    route = APIWebSocketRoute(
        path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependency_overrides_provider=self.dependency_overrides_provider
    )
    self.routes.append(route)
```

By adding the dependency_overrides_provider parameter when creating a new APIWebSocketRoute, we ensure that the dependency overrides are included for websockets as well.

This should resolve the issue of dependency override not working for websockets.
