## Bug analysis

The buggy function `add_api_websocket_route` is not adding the `dependency_overrides_provider` to the `APIWebSocketRoute` object. This could be the reason why the dependency override does not work for websockets, as reported in the issue description.

## Error location

The issue lies in the `add_api_websocket_route` function where the `dependency_overrides_provider` is not being added to the `APIWebSocketRoute` object.

## Reasons behind the bug

The `add_api_websocket_route` function does not include the `dependency_overrides_provider` when creating an `APIWebSocketRoute` object. This leads to the dependency override not being applied to the websocket routes.

## Possible approaches for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, the `add_api_websocket_route` function needs to be updated to include the `dependency_overrides_provider` when creating an `APIWebSocketRoute` object.

## Corrected code

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/fastapi_2/fastapi/routing.py

# corrected function
def add_api_websocket_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None, dependency_overrides_provider=None
) -> None:
    route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependency_overrides_provider=dependency_overrides_provider)
    self.routes.append(route)
```
