Potential error location:
The issue is with the add_api_websocket_route method where the APIWebSocketRoute is being added to self.routes without considering the dependency_overrides_provider.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the dependency_overrides_provider is not being added to the APIWebSocketRoute when the add_api_websocket_route method is called.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the add_api_websocket_route method to include the dependency_overrides_provider when creating the APIWebSocketRoute.
2. Ensure that the dependency_overrides_provider is passed down to the APIWebSocketRoute in the add_api_websocket_route method.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class APIRouter(routing.Router):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def add_api_websocket_route(
        self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
    ) -> None:
        route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependency_overrides_provider=self.dependency_overrides_provider)
        self.routes.append(route)
```
In the corrected code, the add_api_websocket_route method has been modified to include the dependency_overrides_provider when creating the APIWebSocketRoute. This ensures that the dependency overrides are taken into account when adding websocket routes.
