Potential Error Location: The bug could be in the way the WebSocket dependency (`ws_dependency`) is overridden.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The error message indicates that the assertion failed because the `websocket.receive_text()` method returned "Socket Dependency" instead of "Override". This suggests that the WebSocket endpoint is not using the overridden dependency as expected.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check that the WebSocket endpoint is using the correct dependency and is not indirectly accessing the original dependency.
2. Verify that the dependency_override is properly set before making the WebSocket connection within the test function.

Corrected Code:
```python
# Corrected function
def add_api_websocket_route(
        self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None, dependencies: List[Depends] = None
) -> None:
    if dependencies is None:
        dependencies = []
    route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependencies=dependencies)
    self.routes.append(route)
```

In the test function, ensure that the dependency is properly overridden before making the WebSocket connection:
```python
# Updated test function
def test_router_ws_depends_with_override():
    client = TestClient(app)
    app.dependency_overrides[ws_dependency] = lambda: "Override"
    with client.websocket_connect("/router-ws-depends/") as websocket:
        assert websocket.receive_text() == "Override"
```
