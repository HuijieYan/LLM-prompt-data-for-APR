Potential Error:
The error message suggests that the websocket is receiving "Socket Dependency" instead of "Override" as expected.

Reason for the Bug:
The buggy function `add_api_websocket_route` is not properly adding the websocket route, which might be causing the dependency override to not work as expected.

Possible Fix:
The buggy function `add_api_websocket_route` needs to properly add the websocket route so that the dependency override can apply correctly.

Corrected Code:
```python
from fastapi.routing import APIWebSocketRoute
from typing import Callable

def add_api_websocket_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
) -> None:
    route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name)
    self.routes.append(route)
    self.websocket_routes.append(route)  # Add the websocket route to the websocket_routes list
```
