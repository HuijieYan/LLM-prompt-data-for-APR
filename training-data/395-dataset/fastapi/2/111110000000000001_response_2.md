Potential Error Location: The `add_api_websocket_route` function seems to be attempting to add a new route but it is missing the `routes` attribute. 

Reasons for the Bug:
The `self.routes` attribute is not initialized or declared within the `APIRouter` class. As a result, it is not possible to append a new route to `self.routes` without initializing it first.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
Initialize the `self.routes` attribute as a list within the `APIRouter` class before attempting to append routes to it. This will ensure that the `add_api_websocket_route` function has a place to store the new routes.

Corrected Code:
```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class APIRouter(routing.Router):
    def __init__(self):
        self.routes = []

    def add_api_websocket_route(
        self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
    ) -> None:
        route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name)
        self.routes.append(route)
```
