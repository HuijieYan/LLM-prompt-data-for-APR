The bug in the provided function is that it seems to be missing the definition of the `APIWebSocketRoute` class. Additionally, there is no `Callable` type defined. This could be the reason for the error in the test case `test_router_ws_depends_with_override`.

To fix the bug and update the function, the `APIWebSocketRoute` class needs to be defined, and the `typing` module needs to be imported to use the `Callable` type.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from typing import Callable
class APIWebSocketRoute:
    def __init__(self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None):
        self.path = path
        self.endpoint = endpoint
        self.name = name

def add_api_websocket_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
) -> None:
    route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name)
    self.routes.append(route)
```

This corrected function defines the `APIWebSocketRoute` class and imports `Callable` from the `typing` module. This should resolve the issues with the function and potentially fix the error encountered in the test case.
