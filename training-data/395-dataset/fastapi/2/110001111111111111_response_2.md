The error occurs because the function `add_api_websocket_route` does not take into account the `dependency_overrides_provider` when creating an `APIWebSocketRoute`. This leads to the `websocket_connect` test using the original dependency instead of the overridden one.

To fix this bug, the `add_api_websocket_route` function needs to include the `dependency_overrides_provider` when creating an `APIWebSocketRoute` so that the WebSocket routes can take advantage of dependency overrides.

Here's the corrected code for the `add_api_websocket_route` function:

```python
def add_api_websocket_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None
) -> None:
    route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependency_overrides_provider=self.dependency_overrides_provider)
    self.routes.append(route)
```

By including the `dependency_overrides_provider` in the creation of the `APIWebSocketRoute`, the websocket routes will now consider the dependency overrides, and the `test_router_ws_depends_with_override` test should pass as expected.
