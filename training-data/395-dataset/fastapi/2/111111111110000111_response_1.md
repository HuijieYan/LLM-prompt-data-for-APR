Upon analyzing the provided information, it seems that the issue lies in the add_api_websocket_route function of the APIRouter class. The error message indicates that the websocket receive_text() method is not returning the expected value "Override". This suggests that the dependency_override is not being properly applied to the websocket connection.

The reason behind this bug could be that the add_api_websocket_route function does not incorporate dependency overrides when creating the APIWebSocketRoute.

To fix this bug, the add_api_websocket_route function should be modified to include the dependency_override when creating the APIWebSocketRoute.

Here's the corrected code for the add_api_websocket_route function:

```python
from typing import Callable
from fastapi.routing import APIWebSocketRoute

class APIRouter(routing.Router):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def add_api_websocket_route(
        self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, name: str = None, dependency_overrides: dict = {}
    ) -> None:
        route = APIWebSocketRoute(path, endpoint=endpoint, name=name, dependency_overrides=dependency_overrides)
        self.routes.append(route)
```

In the corrected code, the add_api_websocket_route function now takes an additional parameter dependency_overrides, which is a dictionary containing the dependency overrides. This allows the function to pass the dependency overrides to the APIWebSocketRoute when creating a new route.

By incorporating the dependency overrides in the creation of the APIWebSocketRoute, the bug should be fixed, and the test should work as expected.
