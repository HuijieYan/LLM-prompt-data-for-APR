The error message indicates that the AttributeError is being raised because the object "Config" does not have an attribute called "json_encoders". This implies that the ModelWithConfig class does not have the json_encoders attribute in its Config class.

To fix this, we need to modify the jsonable_encoder function to properly handle the case where the obj is an instance of ModelWithConfig, and the Config class does not have the json_encoders attribute.

Here's the corrected code for the jsonable_encoder function:

```python
def jsonable_encoder(
    obj: Any,
    include: Set[str] = None,
    exclude: Set[str] = set(),
    by_alias: bool = False,
    include_none: bool = True,
    custom_encoder: dict = {},
) -> Any:
    if hasattr(obj, "Config") and hasattr(obj.Config, "json_encoders") and obj.Config.json_encoders:
        return jsonable_encoder(
            obj.dict(include=include, exclude=exclude, by_alias=by_alias),
            include_none=include_none,
            custom_encoder=obj.Config.json_encoders,
        )
    elif isinstance(obj, BaseModel):
        return jsonable_encoder(
            obj.dict(include=include, exclude=exclude, by_alias=by_alias),
            include_none=include_none,
        )
    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

In this corrected code, we check if the obj has a Config attribute, and if it does, whether it has the json_encoders attribute. If it does, we use that for custom encoding. Otherwise, we fall back to the default behavior for BaseModel instances.

This modification will handle the case where the Config class does not have the json_encoders attribute, and prevent the AttributeError from occurring.
