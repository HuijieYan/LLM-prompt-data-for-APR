The test case `test_encode_model_with_config` is trying to encode a model using the `jsonable_encoder` function, but it fails with an `AttributeError` stating that `Config` has no attribute `json_encoders`. This suggests that the `ModelWithConfig` class has a `Config` attribute that is being accessed but does not have the expected `json_encoders` attribute.

The potential error location within the `jsonable_encoder` function is the following block of code:
```python
if isinstance(obj, BaseModel):
        if not obj.Config.json_encoders:
```
This is where the function is trying to access `json_encoders` from the `Config` attribute of the `obj`, assuming that it exists.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `ModelWithConfig` class does not have the `json_encoders` attribute defined in its `Config` class, leading to the `AttributeError`.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `jsonable_encoder` function to handle the `Config` attribute of the `obj` more gracefully. We can check if the `Config` attribute is present and if it has the `json_encoders` attribute before attempting to access it.

Here's the corrected code for the `jsonable_encoder` function:
```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from pydantic.types import Any, Set

def jsonable_encoder(
    obj: Any,
    include: Set[str] = None,
    exclude: Set[str] = set(),
    by_alias: bool = False,
    include_none: bool = True,
    custom_encoder: dict = {},
) -> Any:
    if isinstance(obj, BaseModel):
        if hasattr(obj, "Config") and hasattr(obj.Config, "json_encoders"):
            if not obj.Config.json_encoders:
                return jsonable_encoder(
                    obj.dict(include=include, exclude=exclude, by_alias=by_alias),
                    include_none=include_none,
                )
            else:
                return jsonable_encoder(
                    obj.dict(include=include, exclude=exclude, by_alias=by_alias),
                    include_none=include_none,
                    custom_encoder=obj.Config.json_encoders,
                )
        else:
            return obj.dict(include=include, exclude=exclude, by_alias=by_alias).copy()
    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```
