The error message indicates that the attribute `json_encoders` is not found in the `Config` class of the object `obj`. This is causing an AttributeError within the `jsonable_encoder` function.

The bug seems to be located within the conditional block that checks for `obj.Config.json_encoders`. The function is assuming that the `Config` class of the object `obj` has an attribute called `json_encoders`, which is not always the case.

To fix the bug, you can modify the conditional block to handle cases where `obj.Config.json_encoders` does not exist. This can be achieved by using a try-except block to handle the AttributeError and fall back to a default behavior when `json_encoders` is not present.

Here's the corrected code for the `jsonable_encoder` function:

```python
def jsonable_encoder(
    obj: Any,
    include: Set[str] = None,
    exclude: Set[str] = set(),
    by_alias: bool = False,
    include_none: bool = True,
    custom_encoder: dict = {},
) -> Any:
    if isinstance(obj, BaseModel):
        if hasattr(obj.Config, 'json_encoders') and obj.Config.json_encoders:
            return jsonable_encoder(
                obj.dict(include=include, exclude=exclude, by_alias=by_alias),
                include_none=include_none,
                custom_encoder=obj.Config.json_encoders,
            )
        else:
            return jsonable_encoder(
                obj.dict(include=include, exclude=exclude, by_alias=by_alias),
                include_none=include_none,
            )
    # ... (remaining code remains the same)
```

With this modification, the function first checks if `obj.Config` has the attribute `json_encoders`. If it does, it uses the custom encoder; otherwise, it falls back to the default behavior. This should resolve the AttributeError issue and handle both cases appropriately.
