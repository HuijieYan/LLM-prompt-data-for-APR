The error message indicates that the attribute 'json_encoders' is not found in the 'Config' class of the 'ModelWithConfig' object. This is causing an AttributeError in the `jsonable_encoder` function.

The potential error location within the `jsonable_encoder` function is the following line:
```python
if not obj.Config.json_encoders:
```

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the function is trying to access the attribute 'json_encoders' directly from the 'Config' class of the object, but it seems that the attribute is not defined in the 'Config' class.

To fix this bug, we can modify the code to check if the 'json_encoders' attribute is defined in the 'Config' class of the object before accessing it. If it's not defined, we can use a default value to avoid the AttributeError.

Here's the corrected code for the `jsonable_encoder` function:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel
from enum import Enum
from typing import Any, Set, GeneratorType

def jsonable_encoder(
    obj: Any,
    include: Set[str] = None,
    exclude: Set[str] = set(),
    by_alias: bool = False,
    include_none: bool = True,
    custom_encoder: dict = {},
) -> Any:
    if isinstance(obj, BaseModel):
        if not hasattr(obj.Config, 'json_encoders') or not obj.Config.json_encoders:
            return jsonable_encoder(
                obj.dict(include=include, exclude=exclude, by_alias=by_alias),
                include_none=include_none,
            )
        else:
            return jsonable_encoder(
                obj.dict(include=include, exclude=exclude, by_alias=by_alias),
                include_none=include_none,
                custom_encoder=obj.Config.json_encoders,
            )
    # The rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this modification, the `jsonable_encoder` function will first check if the 'json_encoders' attribute is defined in the 'Config' class before attempting to access it. If it's not defined or if it's empty, the function will proceed with the default behavior.
