The error location in the provided function is when it tries to access the json_encoders attribute of the obj's Config. This is causing an error because json_encoders is not a predefined attribute of the Config class.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the code to check for the presence of json_encoders attribute within the Config class and then use it if available.

Here's the corrected code for the jsonable_encoder function:

```python
# corrected function
def jsonable_encoder(
    obj: Any,
    include: Set[str] = None,
    exclude: Set[str] = set(),
    by_alias: bool = False,
    include_none: bool = True,
    custom_encoder: dict = {},
) -> Any:
    if isinstance(obj, BaseModel):
        if hasattr(obj.Config, 'json_encoders') and obj.Config.json_encoders:
            return jsonable_encoder(
                obj.dict(include=include, exclude=exclude, by_alias=by_alias),
                include_none=include_none,
                custom_encoder=obj.Config.json_encoders,
            )
        else:
            return jsonable_encoder(
                obj.dict(include=include, exclude=exclude, by_alias=by_alias),
                include_none=include_none,
            )
    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this modification, the corrected function will first check if the json_encoders attribute is present in the obj's Config class before attempting to access it. If it's present and not empty, it will be used in the subsequent call to jsonable_encoder. Otherwise, the function will continue with the default behavior.
