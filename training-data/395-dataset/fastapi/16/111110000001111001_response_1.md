The error in the provided code appears to be related to the recursive calls to the `jsonable_encoder` function inside the function itself, causing a stack overflow. This is likely due to the condition for `BaseModel` objects not reaching a base case and continuing to call the function indefinitely.

To fix this issue, we can modify the condition for `BaseModel` objects so that it checks if custom encoders are present in the Config, and if so, uses them for encoding. If not, it should handle the encoding directly without recurring back into the `jsonable_encoder` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `jsonable_encoder` function:

```python
from typing import Any, Set
from pydantic import BaseModel

def jsonable_encoder(
    obj: Any,
    include: Set[str] = None,
    exclude: Set[str] = set(),
    by_alias: bool = False,
    include_none: bool = True,
    custom_encoder: dict = {},
) -> Any:
    if isinstance(obj, BaseModel):
        if obj.Config.json_encoders:
            return {
                key: jsonable_encoder(
                    value,
                    include=include,
                    exclude=exclude,
                    by_alias=by_alias,
                    include_none=include_none,
                    custom_encoder=custom_encoder,
                )
                for key, value in obj.dict(include=include, exclude=exclude, by_alias=by_alias).items()
                if value is not None or include_none
            }
        else:
            return {
                key: value
                for key, value in obj.dict(include=include, exclude=exclude, by_alias=by_alias).items()
                if value is not None or include_none
            }
    # ... (other conditions and logic remain the same)
```

In the corrected code, we have explicitly handled the case when the `BaseModel` object has custom encoders present in its configuration. This resolves the issue of indefinite recursive calls to the `jsonable_encoder` function and should prevent the stack overflow error.
