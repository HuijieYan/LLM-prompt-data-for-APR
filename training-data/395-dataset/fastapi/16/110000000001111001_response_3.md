The potential error in the provided function is within the conditional statements where the function recursively calls itself. This can lead to an infinite loop and result in a "RecursionError" if not handled properly.

When the function is called with an object of type "BaseModel", it checks if "obj.Config.json_encoders" is empty. If it's empty, the function calls itself recursively. Similarly, when the function is called with a dictionary, list, set, etc., it calls itself recursively for each item in the collection. If the "custom_encoder" is not defined properly, it could also lead to errors.

To fix this, we can modify the conditional statements to handle these cases differently and ensure that the function does not go into an infinite recursion.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from typing import Any, Set, GeneratorType
from enum import Enum
from pydantic import BaseModel

def jsonable_encoder(
    obj: Any,
    include: Set[str] = None,
    exclude: Set[str] = set(),
    by_alias: bool = False,
    include_none: bool = True,
    custom_encoder: dict = {},
) -> Any:
    if isinstance(obj, BaseModel):
        if not obj.Config.json_encoders:
            return obj.dict(include=include, exclude=exclude, by_alias=by_alias)
        else:
            return obj.dict(include=include, exclude=exclude, by_alias=by_alias)
    if isinstance(obj, Enum):
        return obj.value
    if isinstance(obj, (str, int, float, type(None))):
        return obj
    if isinstance(obj, dict):
        return {
            jsonable_encoder(
                key,
                by_alias=by_alias,
                include_none=include_none,
                custom_encoder=custom_encoder,
            ): jsonable_encoder(
                value,
                by_alias=by_alias,
                include_none=include_none,
                custom_encoder=custom_encoder,
            )
            for key, value in obj.items()
            if value is not None or include_none
        }
    if isinstance(obj, (list, set, frozenset, GeneratorType, tuple)):
        return [
            jsonable_encoder(
                item,
                include=include,
                exclude=exclude,
                by_alias=by_alias,
                include_none=include_none,
                custom_encoder=custom_encoder,
            )
            for item in obj
        ]
    
    # handle custom encoders
    if custom_encoder and type(obj) in custom_encoder:
        encoder = custom_encoder[type(obj)]
        return encoder(obj)
    
    # handle other cases
    try:
        data = dict(obj)
    except Exception:
        try:
            data = vars(obj)
        except Exception as e:
            raise ValueError(e)
    return data
``` 
In the corrected code, we've removed the recursive calls within the conditional statements and handled the BaseModel, Enum, and other data types separately. We've also added a try-except block for handling custom encoders and non-standard objects. Additionally, we've refactored the conditional statements to improve readability and maintainability.
