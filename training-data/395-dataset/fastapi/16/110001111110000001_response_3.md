The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError raised at line 18 in the `jsonable_encoder` function within the `fastapi/encoders.py` file. It mentions that the type object 'Config' has no attribute 'json_encoders', which suggests that the `Config` object does not have the attribute `json_encoders`.

The potential error location within the function is likely to be the condition `if not obj.Config.json_encoders`, where it's trying to access the attribute `json_encoders` of the `Config` object.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `Config` object associated with the `BaseModel` does not have the attribute `json_encoders`, leading to the AttributeError.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be modified to handle this specific scenario. The function should check for the existence of `json_encoders` in the `Config` object before attempting to access it.

Here's the corrected code for the `jsonable_encoder` function:

```python
from typing import Any, Set, Generator

def jsonable_encoder(
    obj: Any,
    include: Set[str] = None,
    exclude: Set[str] = set(),
    by_alias: bool = False,
    include_none: bool = True,
    custom_encoder: dict = {},
) -> Any:
    # Check if the object is an instance of a BaseModel
    if isinstance(obj, BaseModel):
        if hasattr(obj, 'Config') and hasattr(obj.Config, 'json_encoders') and obj.Config.json_encoders:
            return jsonable_encoder(
                obj.dict(include=include, exclude=exclude, by_alias=by_alias),
                include_none=include_none,
                custom_encoder=obj.Config.json_encoders,
            )
        else:
            return jsonable_encoder(
                obj.dict(include=include, exclude=exclude, by_alias=by_alias),
                include_none=include_none,
            )
    # ... (rest of the function remains the same)
```

This updated code checks for the existence of `Config` and `json_encoders` attributes before accessing them. If `Config` and `json_encoders` exist and `json_encoders` is not empty, the function uses `jsonable_encoder` with the custom encoder. Otherwise, it falls back to the default behavior.
