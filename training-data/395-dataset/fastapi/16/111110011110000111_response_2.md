The error message indicates that the `ModelWithConfig` class has a `Config` attribute, which does not have the `json_encoders` attribute. This is causing an `AttributeError` when trying to access `obj.Config.json_encoders` in the `jsonable_encoder` function.

To fix this issue, we can modify the function to check if the `Config` attribute exists and if it has the `json_encoders` attribute. If it does not exist or does not have the `json_encoders` attribute, we should handle this case appropriately.

Here is the corrected code for the `jsonable_encoder` function:

```python
from typing import Any, Set, Generator


def jsonable_encoder(
    obj: Any,
    include: Set[str] = None,
    exclude: Set[str] = set(),
    by_alias: bool = False,
    include_none: bool = True,
    custom_encoder: dict = {},
) -> Any:
    if hasattr(obj, "Config") and hasattr(obj.Config, "json_encoders") and obj.Config.json_encoders:
        return jsonable_encoder(
            obj.dict(include=include, exclude=exclude, by_alias=by_alias),
            include_none=include_none,
            custom_encoder=obj.Config.json_encoders,
        )
    elif isinstance(obj, BaseModel):
        return jsonable_encoder(
            obj.dict(include=include, exclude=exclude, by_alias=by_alias),
            include_none=include_none,
        )
    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the `obj` has a `Config` attribute and if the `Config` attribute has the `json_encoders` attribute. If it does, we use `obj.Config.json_encoders` for custom encoding. If not, we handle the `obj` as a `BaseModel` without `json_encoders`.

This should fix the `AttributeError` that was occurring and allow the function to handle the `ModelWithConfig` object appropriately.
