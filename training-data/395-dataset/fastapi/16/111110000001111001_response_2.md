The buggy function `jsonable_encoder` is designed to handle different types of input objects and convert them into a JSON-serializable format. The function takes into account different object types such as BaseModel, Enum, str, int, float, dict, list, set, frozenset, GeneratorType, tuple, and custom encoders. However, the function has some issues related to recursive calls and handling of custom encoders.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the recursive calls of `jsonable_encoder` and the handling of custom encoders.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug are as follows:
1. The recursive calls of `jsonable_encoder` may lead to an infinite loop in certain scenarios, causing the function to keep calling itself indefinitely.
2. The handling of custom encoders is not appropriately implemented, leading to errors in identifying the type and encoder for a given object.

To fix the bug, the following approaches can be considered:
1. Implement a base case for the recursive calls of `jsonable_encoder` to ensure that the function does not keep calling itself indefinitely.
2. Improve the handling of custom encoders by properly identifying the type and corresponding encoder for a given object.

Here's the corrected code for the `jsonable_encoder` function:

```python
from typing import Any, Set, Generator, Type, Dict
from enum import Enum
from pydantic import BaseModel

def jsonable_encoder(
    obj: Any,
    include: Set[str] = None,
    exclude: Set[str] = None,
    by_alias: bool = False,
    include_none: bool = True,
    custom_encoder: Dict[Type, Any] = None,
) -> Any:
    exclude = exclude or set()
    custom_encoder = custom_encoder or {}

    if isinstance(obj, BaseModel):
        if not obj.Config.json_encoders:
            return jsonable_encoder(
                obj.dict(
                    include=include,
                    exclude=exclude,
                    by_alias=by_alias
                ),
                include_none=include_none
            )
        else:
            return jsonable_encoder(
                obj.dict(
                    include=include,
                    exclude=exclude,
                    by_alias=by_alias
                ),
                include_none=include_none,
                custom_encoder=obj.Config.json_encoders
            )
    elif isinstance(obj, Enum):
        return obj.value
    elif isinstance(obj, (str, int, float, type(None))):
        return obj
    elif isinstance(obj, dict):
        return {
            jsonable_encoder(
                key,
                by_alias=by_alias,
                include_none=include_none,
                custom_encoder=custom_encoder
            ): jsonable_encoder(
                value,
                by_alias=by_alias,
                include_none=include_none,
                custom_encoder=custom_encoder
            )
            for key, value in obj.items()
            if value is not None or include_none
        }
    elif isinstance(obj, (list, set, frozenset, Generator, tuple)):
        return [
            jsonable_encoder(
                item,
                include=include,
                exclude=exclude,
                by_alias=by_alias,
                include_none=include_none,
                custom_encoder=custom_encoder
            )
            for item in obj
        ]
    else:
        if custom_encoder and type(obj) in custom_encoder:
            encoder = custom_encoder[type(obj)]
        else:
            # Handle other types here, for example:
            if isinstance(obj, bytes):
                return obj.decode('utf-8')
            else:
                raise ValueError(f"Type {type(obj)} is not serializable")
        return encoder(obj)
```

In the corrected code:
1. The base case for recursive calls is properly handled for different object types to prevent infinite loops.
2. The handling of custom encoders is improved by checking the type of the object and appropriately identifying the encoder for serialization. Additionally, a default case is added to handle other types of objects.

These changes help to fix the issues related to recursive calls and handling custom encoders within the `jsonable_encoder` function.
