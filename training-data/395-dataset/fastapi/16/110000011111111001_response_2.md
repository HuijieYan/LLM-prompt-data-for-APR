The error message indicates that the attribute 'json_encoders' is not found in the 'Config' class of the 'ModelWithConfig'. This suggests that the 'Config' class does not have the 'json_encoders' attribute, which leads to the AttributeError.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line:
```python
if not obj.Config.json_encoders:
```
This line assumes that the 'Config' class has a 'json_encoders' attribute, which is not the case based on the error message.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function attempts to access an attribute that does not exist in the 'Config' class of the 'ModelWithConfig', leading to an AttributeError.

To fix the bug, you can modify the code to check if the 'Config' class has a 'json_encoders' attribute using hasattr() method before attempting to access it. If the attribute exists, use it; otherwise, fall back to the default behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Any, Set
from enum import Enum
from fastapi.encoders import jsonable_encoder
from fastapi import BaseModel

def jsonable_encoder(
    obj: Any,
    include: Set[str] = None,
    exclude: Set[str] = set(),
    by_alias: bool = False,
    include_none: bool = True,
    custom_encoder: dict = {},
) -> Any:
    if isinstance(obj, BaseModel):
        if hasattr(obj.Config, "json_encoders") and obj.Config.json_encoders:
            return jsonable_encoder(
                obj.dict(include=include, exclude=exclude, by_alias=by_alias),
                include_none=include_none,
                custom_encoder=obj.Config.json_encoders,
            )
        else:
            return jsonable_encoder(
                obj.dict(include=include, exclude=exclude, by_alias=by_alias),
                include_none=include_none,
            )
    
    # rest of the code remains unchanged
```

By using the hasattr() method to check for the existence of 'json_encoders' attribute in the 'Config' class, we can prevent the AttributeError and handle the behavior accordingly.
