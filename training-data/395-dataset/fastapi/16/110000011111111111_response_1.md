The error message suggests that there is an AttributeError related to the 'json_encoders' attribute within the 'Config' type.

The potential error location in the code is within the 'if not obj.Config.json_encoders' condition.

The bug occurs because the code is trying to access 'json_encoders' directly from 'Config', but 'json_encoders' is not a direct attribute of 'Config'. It might be an attribute of an instance of 'Config' or a subclass of 'Config'.

To fix this bug, you can access 'json_encoders' from the instance of 'Config' instead of directly from 'Config'. You may achieve this by accessing it through 'obj.Config' instead of 'Config' directly.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def jsonable_encoder(
    obj: Any,
    include: Set[str] = None,
    exclude: Set[str] = set(),
    by_alias: bool = False,
    include_none: bool = True,
    custom_encoder: dict = {},
) -> Any:
    if isinstance(obj, BaseModel):
        if obj.Config.json_encoders:  # Accessing 'json_encoders' from the instance of 'Config'
            return jsonable_encoder(
                obj.dict(include=include, exclude=exclude, by_alias=by_alias),
                include_none=include_none,
                custom_encoder=obj.Config.json_encoders,  # Accessing 'json_encoders' from the instance of 'Config'
            )
        else:
            return jsonable_encoder(
                obj.dict(include=include, exclude=exclude, by_alias=by_alias),
                include_none=include_none,
            )
    
    # ... (the rest of the code remains unchanged)
```
