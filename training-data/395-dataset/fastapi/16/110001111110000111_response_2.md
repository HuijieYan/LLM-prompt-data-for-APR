The error message indicates that the attribute `json_encoders` is not found in the `Config` object of the `ModelWithConfig` instance. This points to a potential issue in the function where it tries to access `obj.Config.json_encoders`.

The bug occurs because the function is assuming that `obj` is an instance of `BaseModel` and has a `Config` attribute with `json_encoders`, which might not be the case for all objects passed to the function.

To fix this issue, we can modify the function to handle the case where `obj` is not an instance of `BaseModel`, and safely access the `Config` and `json_encoders` attributes without raising an AttributeError.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
from typing import Any, Set, GeneratorType
from enum import Enum
from pydantic import BaseModel

def jsonable_encoder(
    obj: Any,
    include: Set[str] = None,
    exclude: Set[str] = set(),
    by_alias: bool = False,
    include_none: bool = True,
    custom_encoder: dict = {},
) -> Any:
    if isinstance(obj, BaseModel):
        if hasattr(obj, 'Config') and hasattr(obj.Config, 'json_encoders') and obj.Config.json_encoders:
            return jsonable_encoder(
                obj.dict(include=include, exclude=exclude, by_alias=by_alias),
                include_none=include_none,
                custom_encoder=obj.Config.json_encoders,
            )
        else:
            return jsonable_encoder(
                obj.dict(include=include, exclude=exclude, by_alias=by_alias),
                include_none=include_none,
            )
    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged) ...
```

With this modification, we first check if the `obj` has a `Config` attribute and if it has a `json_encoders` attribute. If it does, we use the custom encoder from the `Config` attribute. If not, we proceed with the default behavior.
