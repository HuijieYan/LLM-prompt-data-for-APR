The bug in the `include_router` function is that it is calling `self.add_api_route` with more arguments than the function signature allows for. This results in a TypeError.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `add_api_route` method to accept the additional parameters being passed to it from the `include_router` method.

Here's the corrected function/method:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class APIRouter(routing.Router):
    # ... omitted code ...


    # signature of a corrected function in this class
    def add_api_route(
        self,
        path: str,
        endpoint: Callable,
        response_model: Any = None,
        status_code: int = 200,
        tags: List[str] = None,
        summary: str = None,
        description: str = None,
        response_description: str = None,
        deprecated: bool = False,
        methods: List[str] = None,
        operation_id: str = None,
        include_in_schema: bool = True,
        content_type: Optional[Dict[str, Union[str, Any]]] = None,
        name: str = None,
    ) -> None:
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass



    # this is the corrected function
    def include_router(
        self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
    ) -> None:
        if prefix:
            assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
            assert not prefix.endswith(
                "/"
            ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
        for route in router.routes:
            if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
                self.add_api_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    response_model=route.response_model,
                    status_code=route.status_code,
                    tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                    summary=route.summary,
                    description=route.description,
                    response_description=route.response_description,
                    deprecated=route.deprecated,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    operation_id=route.operation_id,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    content_type=route.content_type,
                    name=route.name,
                )
            elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
                self.add_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    name=route.name,
                )
```

The `add_api_route` method is modified to accept all the additional parameters being passed to it from the `include_router` method, which resolves the TypeError.
