The bug is likely occurring in the "websocket_connect" method of the "TestClient" class. The error message indicates that a WebSocket disconnect is being raised with the code 1000.

Looking at the function "include_router" provided, the bug is likely related to the construction of the routes for the WebSocket connections in the "TestClient" class. The issue may be that the websocket paths are not being correctly constructed based on the provided prefix.

To fix this bug, it's important to ensure that the path for the WebSocket connection is constructed properly, taking into account any prefix specified for the router.

Here's the corrected code for the "include_router" function:

```python
from fastapi import APIRouter
from starlette.routing import Route as RoutingRoute
from fastapi.routing import APIRoute
from typing import List, Optional

def include_router(
        self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: Optional[List[str]] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, RoutingRoute):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
```

In this corrected code, the type hint for the "tags" parameter has been updated to explicitly allow None as a possible option by making it an Optional type. Additionally, the check for the type of the route has been updated to handle both "APIRoute" and "RoutingRoute" types. Also, the correction has been made in the import statement for "APIRoute".
