The error message from the test function indicates that there is an issue with the WebSocket connection, and it raises a `WebSocketDisconnect` exception with a code of 1000. This error suggests that there might be an issue with the WebSocket connection due to the incorrect handling of the prefix in the `include_router` function.

The issue occurs due to the incorrect handling of the path prefix when adding routes to the router. The `include_router` function is not correctly concatenating the prefix with the path of each route when calling the `add_api_route` method. This results in the WebSocket connection attempting to connect to the incorrect path, leading to the `WebSocketDisconnect` error.

To fix this issue, the `include_router` function should correctly concatenate the prefix with the path of each route before adding it to the router.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` function:

```python
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):  # Check for WebSocketRoute
            self.websocket_route(  # Add WebSocketRoute
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                name=route.name
            )
```

In the corrected function, I added the condition to check if the route is an instance of `routing.WebSocketRoute` and then used the `websocket_route` method to add the WebSocket route with the prefix. This should solve the issue with the WebSocket connections.
