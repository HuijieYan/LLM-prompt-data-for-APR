```python
# Fix for the include_router function
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_api_route(prefix + route.path, route.endpoint)
```
The repaired function removes additional parameters from `self.add_api_route()` and uses `isinstance(route, WebSocketRoute)` instead of `isinstance(route, APIRoute)` for type checking the `route`.
