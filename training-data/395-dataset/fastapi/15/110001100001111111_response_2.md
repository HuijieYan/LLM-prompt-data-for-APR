The issue is that the `include_router` function in FastAPI does not properly handle websocket routes when used with an APIRouter object. When using a websocket route with an APIRouter object, it throws a 403 error.

The bug likely occurs because `include_router` does not handle websocket routes correctly when used with an APIRouter object. This could be due to a missing or incorrect implementation for websocket routes in the `include_router` function.

One possible approach to fix this bug is to update the `include_router` function to handle websocket routes correctly when used with an APIRouter object. This may involve modifying the function logic to properly add websocket routes to the APIRouter object.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` function:

```python
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            if route.websocket:
                self.add_websocket_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                )
            else:
                self.add_api_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    response_model=route.response_model,
                    status_code=route.status_code,
                    tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                    summary=route.summary,
                    description=route.description,
                    response_description=route.response_description,
                    deprecated=route.deprecated,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    operation_id=route.operation_id,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    content_type=route.content_type,
                    name=route.name,
                )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
```
