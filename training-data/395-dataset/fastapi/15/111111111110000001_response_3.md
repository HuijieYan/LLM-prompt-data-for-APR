The error occurs when trying to establish a websocket connection in the test function `test_router()` and `test_prefix_router()`. This error is likely caused by a bug in the `include_router` function. It seems that the `add_api_route` method is being called with more arguments than it expects, which is causing the error.

The `add_api_route` function is currently accepting the arguments `path` and `endpoint`, but is being called with additional arguments such as `response_model`, `status_code`, `tags`, etc. This is causing the functions in the test cases to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `include_router` function to handle the additional arguments and pass them to the `add_api_route` function.

Here's the corrected `include_router` function:

```python
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
```

By removing the additional arguments passed to `add_api_route` and only passing `path` and `endpoint`, we can fix the bug and successfully establish websocket connections in the given test cases.
