The bug occurs in the include_router method where the add_api_route method is called with too many arguments. The add_api_route method only accepts two parameters (self, path), but in the include_router method, it's being called with multiple additional parameters.

To fix the bug, create an APIRoute instance using the parameters from the router and route objects. Then, pass the APIRoute instance to the add_api_route method.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from typing import Callable, List
from fastapi.routing import APIRoute, APIRouter

def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            api_route = APIRoute(
                path=prefix + route.path,
                endpoint=route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                api_route.endpoint
            )
        else:
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
```
