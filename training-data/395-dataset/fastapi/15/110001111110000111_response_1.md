The error message indicates that there is an issue with WebSocket routes not working properly when using APIRouter objects. This suggests that the `include_router` method is not correctly handling WebSocket routes.

The potential error location within the `include_router` function is the handling of WebSocket routes.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `include_router` method is not correctly handling WebSocket routes when using APIRouter objects.

To fix the bug, the `include_router` method needs to be modified to correctly handle WebSocket routes. This may involve checking for the type of route and handling WebSocket routes separately.

The corrected code for the `include_router` method is as follows:

```python
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            if hasattr(route, 'websocket'):  # Check if the route is a WebSocket route
                self.add_websocket_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                )
            else:
                self.add_api_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    response_model=route.response_model,
                    status_code=route.status_code,
                    tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                    summary=route.summary,
                    description=route.description,
                    response_description=route.response_description,
                    deprecated=route.deprecated,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    operation_id=route.operation_id,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    content_type=route.content_type,
                    name=route.name,
                )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
```

This corrected code includes a check for WebSocket routes and uses a separate method (`add_websocket_route`) to handle WebSocket routes individually.
