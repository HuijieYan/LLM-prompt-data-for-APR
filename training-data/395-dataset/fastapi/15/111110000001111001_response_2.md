The issue with the `include_router` function is that it is trying to add a `response_model`, `status_code`, `tags`, `summary`, `description`, `response_description`, `deprecated`, `methods`, `operation_id`, `include_in_schema`, `content_type`, and `name` to the `add_api_route` function, but the `add_api_route` function does not have parameters for all of these attributes.

To fix the bug, the `include_router` function should be modified to remove the unnecessary attributes and their values when calling the `add_api_route` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` function:

```python
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
```
