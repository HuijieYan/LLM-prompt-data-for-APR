The error messages indicate that there is a problem with the websocket connection when using the APIRouter. The issue seems to be related to how websocket routes are handled within the APIRouter.

The potential error location in the code is the `include_router` function, specifically where it handles the websocket routes.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `include_router` function is not properly handling the websocket routes when included in the APIRouter.

To fix the bug, the `include_router` function needs to be modified to properly handle the websocket routes within the APIRouter.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` function:

```python
# relative function's signature in this file
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            if hasattr(route, "websocket"):
                self.add_websocket_route(
                    path=prefix + route.path,
                    endpoint=route.endpoint,
                )
            else:
                self.add_api_route(
                    path=prefix + route.path,
                    endpoint=route.endpoint,
                    response_model=route.response_model,
                    status_code=route.status_code,
                    tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                    summary=route.summary,
                    description=route.description,
                    response_description=route.response_description,
                    deprecated=route.deprecated,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    operation_id=route.operation_id,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    content_type=route.content_type,
                    name=route.name,
                )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
```

In the above code, `add_websocket_route` is added to handle the websocket routes within the APIRouter. This will ensure that the websocket routes work properly when included in the APIRouter.
