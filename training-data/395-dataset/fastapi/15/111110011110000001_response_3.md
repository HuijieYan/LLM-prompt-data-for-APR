The error in the `include_router` method is caused because the `add_api_route` is not expecting the `response_model`, `status_code`, `tags`, `summary`, `description`, `response_description`, `deprecated`, `methods`, `operation_id`, `include_in_schema`, `content_type`, and `name` parameters.

To fix this issue, we need to remove these parameters from the call to `add_api_route` or update the `add_api_route` method to accept these additional parameters.

Here is the corrected code where the unnecessary parameters are removed:

```python
class APIRouter(routing.Router):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def add_api_route(self, path: str, endpoint: Callable) -> None:
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def include_router(
        self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
    ) -> None:
        if prefix:
            assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
            assert not prefix.endswith("/"), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
        for route in router.routes:
            if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
                self.add_api_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint
                )
            elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
                self.add_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    name=route.name
                )
```

By removing the unnecessary parameters from the `add_api_route` method call, we can fix the bug.
