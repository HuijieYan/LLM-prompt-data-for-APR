Potential Error: The `add_api_route` function is being called with too many arguments.

Reason for the Bug: The `add_api_route` function is being called with more arguments than it is defined to accept.

Approach for Fixing the Bug: Remove the additional arguments from the function call to `add_api_route`.

```python
class APIRouter(routing.Router):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def add_api_route(self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, **kwargs) -> None:
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def include_router(
        self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
    ) -> None:
        if prefix:
            assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
            assert not prefix.endswith(
                "/"
            ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
        for route in router.routes:
            if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
                self.add_api_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    **{
                        key: value for key, value in route.__dict__.items() if key in {"response_model", "status_code", "summary", "description", "response_description", "deprecated"}
                    },
                    tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                    methods=route.methods,
                    operation_id=route.operation_id,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    content_type=route.content_type,
                    name=route.name,
                )
            elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
                self.add_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    name=route.name,
                )
