Potential error location: The `add_api_route` function call inside the `include_router` function is passing more arguments than the function definition allows.

Reason for the bug: The `add_api_route` function accepts 3 positional arguments (self, path, endpoint) but the `include_router` function is passing additional keyword arguments.

Approach for fixing the bug: Modify the `add_api_route` function to accept keyword arguments and then update the `include_router` function to pass the necessary keyword arguments.

Corrected code:

```python
# class declaration containing the fixed function
class APIRouter(routing.Router):
    # ... omitted code ...


    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def add_api_route(self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, **kwargs) -> None:
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass



    # this is the fixed function
    def include_router(
        self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
    ) -> None:
        if prefix:
            assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
            assert not prefix.endswith(
                "/"
            ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
        for route in router.routes:
            if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
                self.add_api_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    response_model=route.response_model,
