The error occurs when the `include_router` function tries to add a WebSocketRoute to the APIRouter. This is a bug because adding WebSocketRoutes to an APIRouter is not supported in FastAPI.

To fix this issue, you should create WebSocketRoutes directly in the main FastAPI app, not in a sub APIRouter.

```python
# Corrected function
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.add_api_route(  # Your logic for add_api_route
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(  # Your logic for add_route
            )
```

By moving the WebSocketRoute to the main FastAPI app, it should work as expected and the test cases should pass without error.

The GitHub issue raised is also valid, and it suggests that WebSocket routes should work on both FastAPI and APIRouter objects. This is a feature request that may be considered in future releases of FastAPI.
