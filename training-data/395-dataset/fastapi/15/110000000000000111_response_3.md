The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the section that handles websocket routes.

The reason behind the bug is that the `include_router` function does not handle websocket routes properly when copying the function from a FastAPI object to an APIRouter object. WebSocket routes only work on the main FastAPI object, not on APIRouter objects.

To fix the bug, the `include_router` function needs to be updated to properly handle websocket routes when adding routes from an APIRouter to a FastAPI object.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` function:

```python
from fastapi.routing import APIRoute
from fastapi.routing import APIRouter
from fastapi.routing import APIWebSocketRoute
from fastapi.routing import APIRoute
from fastapi.routing import routing


def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, APIWebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(  # Add WebSocket route
                prefix + route.path,  # Add prefix
                route.endpoint,  # Add endpoint
                name=route.name,  # Add name
            )

```
