Sure, here's the fully fixed `include_router` function:

```python
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None, responses: Dict[Union[int, str], Dict[str, Any]] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        self.add_api_route(
            prefix + route.path,
            route.endpoint,
        )
```
