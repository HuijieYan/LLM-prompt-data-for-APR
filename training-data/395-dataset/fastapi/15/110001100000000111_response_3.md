The issue seems to be related to the `include_router` method within the `APIRouter` class, where websocket routes are not working as expected when included in the router. The issue may lie in how the `add_api_route` method is used within the `include_router` method.

The bug occurs because the `add_api_route` method is not properly handling websocket routes when adding them to the APIRouter. This could be due to the fact that websocket routes require different handling compared to regular HTTP routes.

To fix the bug, the `include_router` method needs to be updated to properly handle websocket routes when adding them to the APIRouter. This likely involves implementing separate logic for websocket routes within the `add_api_route` method to ensure they are correctly processed.

```python
# Corrected include_router method
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            if route.websocket:
                self.websocket_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    name=route.name,
                )
            else:
                self.add_api_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    response_model=route.response_model,
                    status_code=route.status_code,
                    tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                    summary=route.summary,
                    description=route.description,
                    response_description=route.response_description,
                    deprecated=route.deprecated,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    operation_id=route.operation_id,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    content_type=route.content_type,
                    name=route.name,
                )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
``` 

In this corrected method, we have added a conditional check to handle websocket routes separately, using the `websocket_route` method instead of `add_api_route` for websocket routes. This should resolve the issue with websocket routes not working properly when added to the APIRouter.
