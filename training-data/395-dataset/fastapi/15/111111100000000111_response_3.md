Potential error location: The issue seems to be occurring in the `include_router` method of the `APIRouter` class.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: It appears that the `include_router` method is trying to add a websocket route to the `APIRouter` object, which is not being handled properly, leading to a 403 error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
- To handle websocket routes properly in the `include_router` method, the `add_api_route` method should be updated to support websocket routes.
- It may require changes to the `add_api_route` method to handle websocket routes, which may involve modifying the method signature and its implementation to support websocket routes.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import List, Callable
from fastapi.routing import APIRoute
from fastapi.routing import router as routing

class APIRouter(routing.APIRouter):
    def include_router(
        self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
    ) -> None:
        if prefix:
            assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
            assert not prefix.endswith(
                "/"
            ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
        for route in router.routes:
            if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
                if route.is_websocket:
                    self.add_websocket_route(
                        prefix + route.path,
                        route.endpoint,
                        name=route.name,
                    )
                else:
                    self.add_api_route(
                        prefix + route.path,

                        response_model=route.response_model,

                        tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),

                    )
            elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
                self.add_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
