The bug seems to be related to the inability of websocket routes to work on APIRouter objects, as they only seem to work on the main FastAPI object. 

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `include_router` method. It is trying to add API routes to the APIRouter, but it is missing the logic to handle websocket routes.

The bug occurs because the `include_router` method does not handle websocket routes properly. It only handles API routes, so when trying to include a router with a websocket route, it throws a 403 error.

To fix the bug, the `include_router` method needs to be updated to handle websocket routes as well.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` method:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class APIRouter(routing.Router):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # corrected include_router method
    def include_router(
        self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
    ) -> None:
        if prefix:
            assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
            assert not prefix.endswith(
                "/"
            ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
        for route in router.routes:
            if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
                if route.websocket:
                    # handle websocket route
                    self.websocket_route(
                        prefix + route.path,
                        route.endpoint,
                    )
                else:
                    self.add_api_route(
                        prefix + route.path,
                        route.endpoint,
                        response_model=route.response_model,
                        status_code=route.status_code,
                        tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                        summary=route.summary,
                        description=route.description,
                        response_description=route.response_description,
                        deprecated=route.deprecated,
                        methods=route.methods,
                        operation_id=route.operation_id,
                        include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                        content_type=route.content_type,
                        name=route.name,
                    )
            elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
                self.add_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    name=route.name,
                )
```

This corrected function now handles both API routes and websocket routes when including a router.
