The error occurs when the `WebSocketDisconnect` exception is raised in the test functions. This exception is related to the `websocket_connect` method and is likely caused by an issue in the `include_router` function, particularly in how it handles the `prefix` parameter.

The bug occurs because `include_router` function calls the `add_api_route` function with the wrong number of arguments. 

To fix the bug:
- Update the `add_api_route` function to accept the correct set of arguments. The `include_router` function passes additional arguments to `add_api_route`, so the signature of `add_api_route` should include those arguments.
- Remove the additional arguments passed to `add_api_route` from the `include_router` function to match the signature of `add_api_route`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from typing import List, Callable
from fastapi.routing import APIRoute, APIRouter

def add_api_route(
    self, path: str, endpoint: Callable, response_model=None, status_code=None, tags=None, 
    summary=None, description=None, response_description=None, deprecated=None, methods=None, 
    operation_id=None, include_in_schema=None, content_type=None, name=None
) -> None:
    # ... implementation ...
    pass

def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
