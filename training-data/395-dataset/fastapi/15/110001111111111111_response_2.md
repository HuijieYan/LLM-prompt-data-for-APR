The bug seems to be located in the `include_router` method of the `APIRouter` class. When this method is called with a router that includes a websocket route, it fails to properly handle the route.

The issue stems from the fact that the `include_router` method does not handle websocket routes properly. In the second test case, the websocket route is mapped to the wrong endpoint, leading to a failed connection when trying to establish a websocket connection.

To fix this bug, the `include_router` method should be updated to handle websocket routes correctly. This may involve checking the route type and handling websocket routes differently from standard HTTP routes.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` method:

```python
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
```

This code checks for `WebsocketRoute` instances and adds websocket routes if found. It also ensures that standard HTTP routes are handled correctly. With this update, the `include_router` method should be able to handle websocket routes correctly and fix the issue with the failing websocket connections.
