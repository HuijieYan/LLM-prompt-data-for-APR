The issue is that the `include_router` method is not including WebSocket routes when using `APIRouter`. This is evident from the error message which indicates that there is a problem with WebSocket routes when using `APIRouter`.

The potential error location is the `include_router` method within the `APIRouter` class. It seems that the method is not correctly handling WebSocket routes when including them from another router.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `include_router` method of the `APIRouter` class is not properly handling WebSocket routes when including them from another router. This results in WebSocket routes not being registered and causing the test functions to fail.

To fix the bug, the `include_router` method needs to be modified to correctly handle WebSocket routes. The method should iterate over all routes in the router being included and register WebSocket routes in addition to HTTP routes.

Here's the corrected `include_router` method:

```python
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            if route.websocket:
                self.add_websocket_route(
                    prefix + route.path, route.endpoint, name=route.name
                )
            else:
                self.add_api_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    response_model=route.response_model,
                    status_code=route.status_code,
                    tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                    summary=route.summary,
                    description=route.description,
                    response_description=route.response_description,
                    deprecated=route.deprecated,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    operation_id=route.operation_id,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    content_type=route.content_type,
                    name=route.name,
                )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
```

In the corrected code, a check is added to identify WebSocket routes and register them using the `add_websocket_route` method, which should resolve the issue with WebSocket routes not being properly included.
