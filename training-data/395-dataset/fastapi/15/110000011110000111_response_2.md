The error message from the test functions indicates that there is an issue with `websocket_connect` function, and it is related to the websocket routes. 

Upon analyzing the provided code, it seems that the issue is due to how the `include_router` function handles the websocket routes, as it focuses on adding API and routing routes, but doesn't account for websocket routes.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `include_router` function to handle websocket routes as well.

Here's the corrected `include_router` function:

```python
from fastapi import WebSocket, WebSocketDisconnect
from fastapi import APIRouter, Request, Response, HTTPException
from fastapi.responses import HTMLResponse
from typing import List, Optional

def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.WebSocketRoute):
            async def websocket_endpoint(websocket: WebSocket):
                try:
                    await route.call(websocket=websocket)
                except WebSocketDisconnect:
                    await websocket.close()
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                websocket_endpoint,
                name=route.name,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
            )
```

In this corrected function, we added an additional check for websocket routes by including an `elif` statement. We then define a new `websocket_endpoint` function to handle the websocket routes, and add the websocket route using `self.add_websocket_route` method.

This fix allows the `include_router` function to handle websocket routes properly, and should resolve the issue with the websocket routes not working when defined within an `APIRouter`.
