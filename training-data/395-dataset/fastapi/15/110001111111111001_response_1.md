The buggy function `include_router` is trying to iterate through the routes provided by the `router` and add them to the API routes with the specified prefix. However, it fails to do so because it calls `add_api_route` inside the loop but the `add_api_route` only accepts two arguments, `path` and `endpoint`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to use the `add_api_route` method by providing only the `path` and `endpoint`, and assign other attributes directly to the APIRoute instance.

Here is the corrected code for the `include_router` function:

```python
def include_router(
        self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
    ) -> None:
        if prefix:
            assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
            assert not prefix.endswith(
                "/"
            ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
        for route in router.routes:
            if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
                modified_route = APIRoute(
                    path = prefix + route.path,
                    endpoint = route.endpoint,
                    response_model = route.response_model,
                    status_code = route.status_code,
                    tags = (route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                    summary = route.summary,
                    description = route.description,
                    response_description = route.response_description,
                    deprecated = route.deprecated,
                    methods = route.methods,
                    operation_id = route.operation_id,
                    include_in_schema = route.include_in_schema,
                    content_type = route.content_type,
                    name = route.name,
                )
                self.add_api_route(
                    modified_route.path,
                    modified_route.endpoint
                )
            elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
                self.add_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    name=route.name,
                )
```

This modified function creates a new `APIRoute` instance with the modified path and other attributes and then calls `add_api_route` with the path and endpoint of the modified route.
