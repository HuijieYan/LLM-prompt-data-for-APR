Potential Error Location:
The error is occurring when the client tries to establish a websocket connection using the provided URL. This error is related to the way the URL prefix is being handled in the `include_router` function.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug seems to be related to how the URL prefix is handled when connecting to the websocket. There may be an issue in how the prefix is being added to the endpoint when establishing the websocket connection, leading to a malformed URL.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Verify that the `include_router` function correctly handles the addition of the prefix to the route paths.
2. Ensure that the prefix doesn't end with a '/' to prevent the final URL from being malformed.
3. Modify the function to correctly handle adding the prefix to the route paths, ensuring that the URL is constructed correctly.

Corrected Code for the problematic function `include_router`:
```python
from typing import List
from fastapi import APIRoute, routing

def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith("/"), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"

    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            route_prefix = prefix + ("" if prefix.endswith("/") else "/")  # Adjust the route prefix based on the '/' ending
            self.add_api_route(
                route_prefix + route.path.lstrip("/"),  # Handle leading '/' in route path
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            route_prefix = prefix + ("" if prefix.endswith("/") else "/")  # Adjust the route prefix based on the '/' ending
            self.add_route(
                route_prefix + route.path.lstrip("/"),  # Handle leading '/' in route path
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
```
In the corrected code, we ensure that the route prefix is handled appropriately by adding or removing the '/' as necessary. Additionally, we handle the leading '/' in the route path to construct the correct URL.
