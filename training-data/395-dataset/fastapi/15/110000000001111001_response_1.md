The bug occurs when the function `include_router` adds a prefix to the route paths. The bug is likely related to the prefix concatenation as it is not handled correctly.

When the `prefix` is empty, it should not be concatenated with the `route.path` directly. Instead, it should only use the `route.path` as it is. Also, the condition for checking if the prefix ends with "/" is incorrect.

To fix the bug, a simple if-else condition can be used to handle the concatenation of the prefix with the route path based on whether the prefix is empty or not.

Below is the corrected code for the `include_router` function:

```python
from fastapi.routing import APIRoute, APIRouter
from starlette.routing import WebSocketRoute, Route

def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            if prefix:
                path = f"{prefix}{route.path}" if not prefix.endswith('/') else f"{prefix}{route.path[1:]}"
            else:
                path = route.path
            self.add_api_route(
                path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, Route):
            if prefix:
                path = f"{prefix}{route.path}" if not prefix.endswith('/') else f"{prefix}{route.path[1:]}"
            else:
                path = route.path
            self.add_route(
                path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
```

This code now correctly handles the concatenation of the prefix with the route paths.
