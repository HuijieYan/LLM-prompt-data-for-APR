The error seems to occur when attempting to use a WebSocket route with a route that has a prefix. This could be due to the WebSocket routes being added using the `add_api_route` function, which does not support WebSocket routes. Instead, WebSocket routes should be added using the `add_websocket_route` function.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `include_router` function to properly handle WebSocket routes when adding routes from an APIRouter to the main FastAPI app.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` function:

```python
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            if route.websocket:
                self.add_websocket_route(  # Use add_websocket_route for WebSocket routes
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    name=route.name,
                )
            else:
                self.add_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    name=route.name,
                )
```

By using `add_websocket_route` for WebSocket routes, we eliminate the error when trying to establish a WebSocket connection and also fix the issue where WebSocket routes were only working on the main FastAPI object, not on APIRouter objects.
