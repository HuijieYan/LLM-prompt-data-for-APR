The bug occurs in the function `include_router` within the `APIRouter` class. The issue is that the `include_router` function does not handle the route's attributes correctly. It attempts to call the `add_api_route` function and assigns a variety of parameters, but the `add_api_route` function only takes `path` and `endpoint` as arguments.

The bug occurs because the `include_router` tries to pass extra parameters to the `add_api_route` function, which it doesn't accept.

To fix this bug, the `include_router` function should be modified to extract the necessary information from the `router` and then call `add_api_route` with only the `path` and `endpoint` parameters. Any other route attributes should be handled within the `add_api_route` function of the `APIRouter` class.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` function within the `APIRouter` class:

```python
def include_router(self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
        
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.add_api_route(prefix + route.path, route.endpoint)
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(prefix + route.path, route.endpoint)
```

In this corrected code, we have removed the additional attributes from the `self.add_api_route` function call within the `include_router` function and retained only the `path` and `endpoint` parameters. Any additional attributes should be handled within the `add_api_route` function of the `APIRouter` class.
