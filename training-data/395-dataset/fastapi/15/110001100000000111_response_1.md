The bug occurs in the `include_router` method of the `routing.py` file. The issue is that when a websocket route is added to an APIRouter object using the `include_router` method, it throws a 403 error.

The reason behind the bug is that the `include_router` method does not properly handle websocket routes when adding them to an APIRouter object.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `include_router` method to handle websocket routes properly when adding them to an APIRouter object.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` method:

```python
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith("/"), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            if route.websocket:
                self.add_websocket_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    name=route.name,
                )
            else:
                self.add_api_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    response_model=route.response_model,
                    status_code=route.status_code,
                    tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                    summary=route.summary,
                    description=route.description,
                    response_description=route.response_description,
                    deprecated=route.deprecated,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    operation_id=route.operation_id,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    content_type=route.content_type,
                    name=route.name,
                )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
```

In the corrected code, we added a condition to check if the route is a websocket route, and if so, use the `add_websocket_route` method to add the websocket route instead of the `add_api_route` method. This should resolve the issue with websocket routes not working properly on APIRouter objects.
