The bug occurs when trying to use WebSocket routes on an APIRouter object instead of the main FastAPI object. This results in a 403 error.

The potential error location within the code is the `include_router` method of the `APIRouter` class. The method is trying to add WebSocket routes to the router but is not handling them properly, resulting in a 403 error.

The bug occurs because the `add_api_route` method does not handle WebSocket routes properly when adding routes from an APIRouter to the main FastAPI object.

To fix the bug, the `add_api_route` method needs to properly handle WebSocket routes when adding them to the router.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` method:

```python
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            if isinstance(route, WebSocketRoute):
                self.websocket_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    name=route.name
                )
            else:
                self.add_api_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    response_model=route.response_model,
                    status_code=route.status_code,
                    tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                    summary=route.summary,
                    description=route.description,
                    response_description=route.response_description,
                    deprecated=route.deprecated,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    operation_id=route.operation_id,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    content_type=route.content_type,
                    name=route.name,
                )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
``` 

In the corrected code, we have added a check for `WebSocketRoute` and used the `websocket_route` method to add WebSocket routes to the router. This should resolve the issue of WebSocket routes not working properly on the APIRouter object.
