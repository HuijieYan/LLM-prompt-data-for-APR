The error seems to be occurring during the WebSocket connection to the routes "/router" and "/prefix/". This indicates that the `include_router` method is not correctly adding the routes to the APIRouter, which later causes the WebSocket connection to fail.

Potential Error Location:
The error seems to be in the `include_router` function within the `APIRouter` class, as it attempts to add routes to the router, but it is not doing so correctly.

Reasons for the Bug:
The `include_router` function is not correctly adding the routes from the `router` parameter to the current `APIRouter` instance.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `include_router` function to correctly add the routes from the `router` parameter to the current instance of `APIRouter`.
2. Ensure that the `add_api_route` function within the `APIRouter` class is called with the correct parameters.

Corrected Code:
```python
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
