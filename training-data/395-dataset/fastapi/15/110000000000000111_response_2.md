The bug appears to be related to the inclusion of websocket routes in APIRouter objects. The code provided in the "include_router" function seems to be missing the implementation for handling websocket routes, which is causing the 403 error when trying to include websocket routes in APIRouter objects.

The bug is occurring because the "include_router" function does not have the necessary logic to handle websocket routes when including them from APIRouter objects.

To fix this bug, the "include_router" function should be updated to include the logic for handling websocket routes when including them from APIRouter objects.

Here's the corrected code for the "include_router" function:

```python
from fastapi.routing import APIRoute, APIWebSocketRoute
from fastapi.routing import APIRouter, routing
from typing import List

def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, APIWebSocketRoute):
            self.add_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                name=route.name
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
```

In the corrected code, I added a condition to check if the route is an instance of APIWebSocketRoute, and if so, it calls the "add_websocket_route" method to include the websocket route in the main FastAPI object. With this update, the "include_router" function should now handle both regular HTTP routes and websocket routes when included from APIRouter objects.
