The error message indicates that there is an issue with connecting to websocket routes when they are included in an APIRouter object. The issue seems to be related to the `include_router` function and how it handles websocket routes.

It seems that the `include_router` function does not properly handle websocket routes when including them from another APIRouter object. This is likely causing the websocket connections to fail when using the APIRouter.

To fix this issue, the `include_router` function needs to be modified to also handle websocket routes correctly when including them from another APIRouter object.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` function:

```python
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            if isinstance(route, WebSocketRoute):
                self.add_websocket_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    name=route.name,
                )
            else:
                self.add_api_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    response_model=route.response_model,
                    status_code=route.status_code,
                    tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                    summary=route.summary,
                    description=route.description,
                    response_description=route.response_description,
                    deprecated=route.deprecated,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    operation_id=route.operation_id,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    content_type=route.content_type,
                    name=route.name,
                )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
```

In the corrected code, the `include_router` function has been updated to handle WebSocketRoute objects separately from APIRoute objects. When it encounters a WebSocketRoute, it calls the `add_websocket_route` function instead of the `add_api_route` function. This ensures that websocket routes are handled correctly when including them from another APIRouter object.
