The function `include_router` seems to be adding routes based on the provided `router` and `prefix`. The error messages show that the `websocket_connect` is failing.

The bug seems to be related to the `prefix` variable. The function is supposed to add the prefix to the route path, but it is not working as expected when the prefix is provided.

The issue is that when a non-empty prefix is being provided, it is not being handled correctly when adding the routes. The `prefix` is not being manipulated correctly when being concatenated with the route path.

To fix this bug, the logic for handling the `prefix` needs to be adjusted. When adding the routes, instead of simply concatenating the `prefix` and the `route.path`, it should be ensured that the resulting path is correctly formatted (i.e., ensuring there are no double slashes). Also, consider handling edge cases when the `prefix` is an empty string.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` function:

```python
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            route_path = prefix + route.path
            # Ensure the resulting path is correctly formatted
            route_path = "/" + route_path.strip("/")
            self.add_api_route(
                route_path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            route_path = prefix + route.path
            # Ensure the resulting path is correctly formatted
            route_path = "/" + route_path.strip("/")
            self.add_route(
                route_path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
```
This corrected code ensures that the `prefix` is concatenated with the route path correctly and formatted properly. It should resolve the issue and allow the `websocket_connect` to work as expected in the provided test cases.
