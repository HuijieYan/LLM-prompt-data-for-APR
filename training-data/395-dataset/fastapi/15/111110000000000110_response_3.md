# Corrected function

```python
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
            )
```
The explanation is clearly given the issue description. The problem is with the `include_router` function, where it is trying to add a websocket route to an APIRouter object. The corrected function removes unnecessary parameters and only includes the `prefix` and `endpoint` while calling `add_api_route`.
