The error message indicates that the WebSocket connection is being closed with a 1000 status code. This suggests that the WebSocket connection is not being established properly, likely due to an issue in the `include_router` function. 

The bug in the `include_router` function arises from the fact that the function is trying to call `self.add_api_route` with incorrect arguments. The original code is trying to pass more arguments to `self.add_api_route` than it accepts, leading to errors.

To fix the bug, the `include_router` function should be modified to properly handle the WebSocketRoute objects. It should call the `add_route` function for WebSocketRoute objects and `router.add_api_route` for APIRoute objects, while considering the prefix. The correct number of arguments for these functions should be provided.

Here's the corrected `include_router` function:

```python
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
```
