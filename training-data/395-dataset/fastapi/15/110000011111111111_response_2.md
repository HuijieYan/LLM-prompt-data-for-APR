The bug in the provided function is due to the incorrect usage of `websocket_connect` in the test functions. The function `include_router` itself seems to be working fine given the provided details.

The error message from the test function indicates a `WebSocketDisconnect` error, which is likely due to the incorrect handling of the websocket connection in the test functions. This error is not related to the `include_router` function.

As a solution, the `websocket_connect` method should be used with the correct URL for the websocket endpoint. Based on the error message, it seems that the path for the websocket connection is incorrect, leading to a 403 (Forbidden) error. 

The correct paths for the websocket connections should be "/router" and "/prefix/" based on the test function names "test_router" and "test_prefix_router" respectively.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Buggy function corrected
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
```

It is important to note that the issues described in the error messages are not related to the `include_router` function, but rather to the testing methods. The function itself does not need to be fixed based on the provided details.
