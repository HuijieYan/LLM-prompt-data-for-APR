Potential error location: The `include_router` method is attempting to connect to a WebSocket using the provided `prefix` value, but it is not handling WebSocket connections.

Reason for the occurrence of the bug: The `include_router` method is intended to include routes from another router, but it does not have functionality to handle WebSocket connections.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Modify the `include_router` method to handle WebSocket connections by including the necessary logic for WebSocket routes.

Corrected code for the `include_router` method:

```python
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_websocket_route(  # Updated line to handle WebSocket routes
                prefix + route.path,  # prefix added for WebSocket route
                route.endpoint,
                name=route.name,  # WebSocket route name
            )
            self.add_route(  # Added to handle HTTP requests
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
```
