The bug occurs in the `include_router` function. The issue is that it is not properly handling WebSocket routes when included in another router.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `include_router` function to correctly handle WebSocket routes when included in the APIRouter.

Here is the corrected code for the `include_router` function:

```python
# corrected function
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            if isinstance(route, WebSocketRoute):
                websocket_route = WebSocketRoute(route.path, route.endpoint)
                router.routes.remove(route)
                router.routes.append(websocket_route)
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
```

In the corrected function, we are checking if the route is a WebSocketRoute, and if so, we are creating a new WebSocketRoute and replacing the original route with the new WebSocketRoute. Then we continue to add the routes as before. This modification should fix the issue with WebSocket routes when included in the APIRouter.
