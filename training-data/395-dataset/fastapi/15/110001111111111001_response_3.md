Potential Issues:
1. The `add_api_route` function is being called without a `response_model`, `status_code`, `tags`, `summary`, `description`, `response_description`, `deprecated`, `methods`, `operation_id`, `include_in_schema`, and `content_type` as per its signature.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the `add_api_route` call to include only the required parameters as per its signature.
2. Use the `**kwargs` syntax to pass all parameters without explicitly specifying each one.

Corrected Code:
```python
# relative function's signature in this file
from typing import Callable
from fastapi.routing import APIRouter, APIRoute

def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: list = None
) -> None:
    if prefix and not prefix.endswith("/"):
        prefix += "/"

    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.add_api_route(prefix + route.path, route.endpoint)
```
