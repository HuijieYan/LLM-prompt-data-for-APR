The issue with the provided `include_router` function is that it is trying to add WebSocket routes using `router.websocket_route` method. However, the correct method to add WebSocket routes inside an APIRouter object is `router.add_api_websocket_route`. This is causing the WebSocket routes to fail when using APIRouter.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `include_router` function to use the `add_api_websocket_route` method instead of `websocket_route`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# corrected include_router function
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            self.add_api_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                response_model=route.response_model,
                status_code=route.status_code,
                tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                summary=route.summary,
                description=route.description,
                response_description=route.response_description,
                deprecated=route.deprecated,
                methods=route.methods,
                operation_id=route.operation_id,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                content_type=route.content_type,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, routing.Route):
            self.add_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                methods=route.methods,
                include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                name=route.name,
            )
        elif isinstance(route, WebSocketRoute):
            self.add_api_websocket_route(
                prefix + route.path,
                route.endpoint,
                name=route.name
            )
```

With this corrected function, WebSocket routes added to an APIRouter will work as expected, and the provided test cases should pass without any issues.
