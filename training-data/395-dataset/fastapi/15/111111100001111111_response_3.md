The issue is that websocket routes only work on the main FastAPI object and not on APIRouter objects. When the `hello` function is moved from the main FastAPI object to an APIRouter object, it fails to work.

The potential error is in the `include_router` method of the `APIRouter` class. The method is not correctly handling websocket routes when included in the router.

The bug occurs because the `include_router` method does not properly handle websocket routes when they are included in the router.

To fix the bug, the `include_router` method should be modified to handle websocket routes correctly when included in the router.

Here's the corrected code for the `include_router` method:

```python
def include_router(
    self, router: "APIRouter", *, prefix: str = "", tags: List[str] = None
) -> None:
    if prefix:
        assert prefix.startswith("/"), "A path prefix must start with '/'"
        assert not prefix.endswith(
            "/"
        ), "A path prefix must not end with '/', as the routes will start with '/'"
    for route in router.routes:
        if isinstance(route, APIRoute):
            if isinstance(route, WebSocketRoute):
                self.add_websocket_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    name=route.name,
                    operation_id=route.operation_id,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema
                )
            else:
                self.add_api_route(
                    prefix + route.path,
                    route.endpoint,
                    response_model=route.response_model,
                    status_code=route.status_code,
                    tags=(route.tags or []) + (tags or []),
                    summary=route.summary,
                    description=route.description,
                    response_description=route.response_description,
                    deprecated=route.deprecated,
                    methods=route.methods,
                    operation_id=route.operation_id,
                    include_in_schema=route.include_in_schema,
                    content_type=route.content_type,
                    name=route.name,
                )
```

The `include_router` method now correctly handles websocket routes when included in the router by using the `add_websocket_route` method for websocket routes and the `add_api_route` method for other routes.
