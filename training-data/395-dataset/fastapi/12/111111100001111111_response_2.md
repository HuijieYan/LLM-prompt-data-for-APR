The buggy function `__call__` in the `HTTPBearer` class is supposed to extract the authorization credentials from the request header and return them if they are valid. However, it seems to be incorrectly checking for the "Bearer" scheme and raising an exception with a 403 status code if the scheme is not "Bearer". 

The bug occurs because the function is checking for the "Bearer" scheme only, while it should also handle other types of authorization schemes. Additionally, the function is extracting the credentials from the wrong part of the authorization header, leading to incorrect scheme and credentials extraction.

To fix the bug, we should update the function to handle different authorization schemes and extract the credentials correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `__call__` function in the `HTTPBearer` class:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None

    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    
    if not (scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
            )
        else:
            return None

    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the authorization header exists. If it doesn't, we handle it according to the `auto_error` flag. Then, we extract the scheme and credentials using the `get_authorization_scheme_param` function, and check if they are valid. If not, we again handle it according to the `auto_error` flag. If everything is valid, we return the extracted credentials.
