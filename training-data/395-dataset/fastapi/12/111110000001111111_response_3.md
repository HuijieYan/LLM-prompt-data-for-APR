The potential error in the given function lies in the conditional check for the authentication scheme. The function is checking if the authentication scheme is "bearer" in a case-sensitive manner, which might cause issues if the scheme is provided in a different case.

To fix this bug, we can modify the conditional check to be case-insensitive by converting the `scheme` to lowercase before comparing it with the expected value "bearer".

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
    async def __call__(
        self, request: Request
    ) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
        authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
        scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
        if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
            if self.auto_error:
                raise HTTPException(
                    status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
                )
            else:
                return None
        if scheme.lower() != "bearer":  # Convert 'scheme' to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
            )
        return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
