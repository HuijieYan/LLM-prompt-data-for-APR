Potential error location: The bug may be occurring in the condition `if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):`. This condition may not be checking for all three variables properly due to incorrect syntax.

Reason behind bug: The condition is not properly checking for the existence of all three variables - authorization, scheme, and credentials. This may cause the function to incorrectly handle the absence of any of these variables.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Use proper syntax to check for the existence of all three variables in the condition.

Corrected code:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if authorization:
        scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
        if scheme and credentials:
            if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
                raise HTTPException(
                    status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                    detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
                )
            return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
    if self.auto_error:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
        )
    else:
        return None
```
