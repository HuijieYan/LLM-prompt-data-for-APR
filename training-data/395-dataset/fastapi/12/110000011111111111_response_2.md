The test case `test_security_http_bearer_incorrect_scheme_credentials` is making a request to the endpoint `/users/me` with an incorrect Authorization header value of `"Basic notreally"`. It expects to receive a 200 status code but instead receives a 403 status code, indicating that the authentication process is failing.

The potential error in the function is in the condition `if scheme.lower() != "bearer"`. The code checks if the scheme is not equal to "bearer" in a case-insensitive manner, and if it's not, it raises an HTTPException with a 403 status code.

The bug occurs because the function is not correctly handling the case where the credentials are in the "Basic" scheme instead of the expected "Bearer" scheme.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to check for the "Basic" scheme and handle it appropriately. We also need to refactor the logic around handling auto_error and return the appropriate HTTPAuthorizationCredentials.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(self, request: Request) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None

    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
            )
        else:
            return None

    if scheme.lower() == "bearer":
        return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
    elif self.auto_error:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication scheme"
        )
    else:
        return None
```
