Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the function not correctly handling the "Basic" authentication scheme. The function is checking for the "bearer" scheme, and if it's not found, it raises a 403 error. This causes the test to fail because it expects a status code of 200, but the function raises a 403 error.

Reason for the occurrence of the bug: The function is only checking for the "bearer" scheme and not handling other authentication schemes like "Basic". This causes it to raise a 403 error even when the authentication scheme is "Basic".

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the function to handle other authentication schemes like "Basic" and only raise a 403 error if the authentication scheme is not supported.
2. Update the test case to expect a 403 error instead of a 200 status code since the function is designed to raise a 403 error for unsupported authentication schemes.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/fastapi_12/fastapi/security/http.py

# corrected function
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")

    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
