The error in the test function is due to the fact that the test is expecting a status code of 200, but the buggy function is returning a status code of 403 (HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN). This indicates that the authorization is not being handled correctly in the buggy function.

The potential error in the buggy function is the conditional check for the scheme.lower() != "bearer". This condition is raising an HTTPException with a status code of 403 (HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN) if the scheme is not "bearer". This means that any non-"bearer" authorization scheme will result in a 403 Forbidden status code, which is incorrect behavior considering the function expects the "bearer" scheme as per its name.

To fix the bug, the conditional check for the scheme should be removed, and the function should return None if the scheme is not "bearer". This way, the function will only raise a 403 Forbidden status code if the Authorization header is missing or empty.

Here's the corrected code for the HTTPBearer class:

```python
class HTTPBearer(HTTPBase):
    # ... omitted code ...

    async def __call__(
        self, request: Request
    ) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
        authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
        if not authorization:
            if self.auto_error:
                raise HTTPException(
                    status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
                )
            else:
                return None
        scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
        if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
            return None
        return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
