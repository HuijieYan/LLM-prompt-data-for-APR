The potential error in the provided code is likely related to the `get_authorization_scheme_param` function, which is being used to extract the authentication scheme and credentials from the Authorization header.

The bug in the code is that the `get_authorization_scheme_param` function is being called without any definition or import statement for this function. This means that the code will result in a NameError when executing, as the `get_authorization_scheme_param` function is not defined within the given scope.

To fix this bug, the `get_authorization_scheme_param` function needs to be defined or imported from an external module. Assuming that the function is defined in an external module called `auth_utils`, the corrected code will be as follows:

```python
from auth_utils import get_authorization_scheme_param

# class declaration containing the fixed function
class HTTPBearer(HTTPBase):
    # ... omitted code ...

    async def __call__(
        self, request: Request
    ) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
        authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
        scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
        if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
            if self.auto_error:
                raise HTTPException(
                    status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
                )
            else:
                return None
        if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
            )
        return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
