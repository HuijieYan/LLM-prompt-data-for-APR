The potential error location within the buggy function is the check for the scheme in the 'Authorization' header. 

The bug occurs because the function incorrectly checks for the scheme as 'bearer' in a case-sensitive manner, while the authorization header contains the scheme 'Basic' in lowercase.

To fix the bug, you can modify the comparison to be case-insensitive, allowing for 'bearer' scheme to pass regardless of case.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":  # compare in a case-insensitive manner
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
