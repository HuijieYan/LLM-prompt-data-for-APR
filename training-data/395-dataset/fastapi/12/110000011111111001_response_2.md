The test case `test_security_http_bearer_incorrect_scheme_credentials` is sending a request with the "Authorization" header using the "Basic" scheme, which should trigger a 403 Forbidden response. However, the error message in the test indicates that the response status code is 200 instead of 403, which suggests that the buggy function is not handling the incorrect scheme and credentials properly.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional check on the scheme, where it should be comparing against "Bearer" instead of "Basic".

The bug occurred because the function does not handle the case where the authorization scheme is not "Bearer" correctly. When the scheme is not "Bearer", it should raise a HTTPException with the status code 403, but the function is not doing so.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional check on the scheme to compare against "Bearer" instead of "Basic" and raise a proper HTTPException with the status code 403 for invalid authentication credentials.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":  # Modified conditional check
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
