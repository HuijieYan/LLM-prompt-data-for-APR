Potential error location: The issue seems to be in the `test_security_http_bearer_incorrect_scheme_credentials` function, which is expecting a status code of 200 but is receiving a status code of 403.

Reason for the bug: The `test_security_http_bearer_incorrect_scheme_credentials` function is expecting a status code of 200, but the buggy function in the `HTTPBearer` class is raising a `HTTPException` with a status code of 403 when the scheme is invalid.

Approach to fix the bug: The buggy function should be modified to return a response with a status code of 200 and an appropriate message when the scheme is not "bearer".

```python
#  Corrected function source code
class HTTPBearer(HTTPBase):
    # ... omitted code ...
    
    async def __call__(
        self, request: Request
    ) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
        authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
        scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
        if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
            if self.auto_error:
                raise HTTPException(
                    status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
                )
            else:
                return None
        if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
            if self.auto_error:
                raise HTTPException(
                    status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                    detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
                )
            else:
                return None
        return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

With this correction, when the scheme is not "bearer", the function will return an appropriate response with a status code of 403 if `self.auto_error` is True, or return None if `self.auto_error` is False. This will align the response with the expectations of the `test_security_http_bearer_incorrect_scheme_credentials` function.
