The issue with the provided code is that when the Authorization header is not of type "Bearer", it should return a 403 status code with the message "Invalid authentication credentials", but it is not doing so. This causes the test case to fail with an assertion error.

To fix the issue, we need to modify the function to correctly handle the case when the Authorization header is not of type "Bearer".

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

With this corrected code, when the Authorization header is not present, or the scheme and credentials are not retrieved properly, or when the scheme is not "Bearer", it will return the appropriate HTTPException with the correct status code and message. This should fix the issue with the failing test case.
