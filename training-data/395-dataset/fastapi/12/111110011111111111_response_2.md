The test case `test_security_http_bearer_incorrect_scheme_credentials` is sending a request with an "Authorization" header using the "Basic" scheme, but it is expected to be using the "Bearer" scheme. This mismatch is causing the function to return a status code of 403 (forbidden) instead of the expected 200 (OK) in the test assertion.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison of the scheme with the string "Bearer". The function currently compares the scheme without case sensitivity, so any variation in the case will result in an error. In this case, it should be comparing the scheme case-insensitively.

To fix this bug, you can modify the comparison to be case-insensitive. Here is the corrected code for the `__call__` function:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class HTTPBearer(HTTPBase):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    async def __call__(
        self, request: Request
    ) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
        authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
        scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
        if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
            if self.auto_error:
                raise HTTPException(
                    status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
                )
            else:
                return None
        if scheme.lower() != "bearer":  # compare scheme case-insensitively
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
            )
        return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
