Potential Error Location:
The bug is likely located in the if statement checking for the presence of the "Bearer" scheme in the authorization header.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function incorrectly checks for the "Bearer" scheme in the authorization header. In the provided test case, the authorization scheme is "Basic" instead of "Bearer," so the function should not raise an HTTPException for invalid authentication credentials.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
Alter the if statement to check for the "Bearer" scheme and return the credentials if the scheme matches.

Corrected Code:
```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if self.scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
