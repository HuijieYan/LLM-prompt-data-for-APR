The error occurs because the test case expects a status code of 200, but the buggy function is returning a status code of 403. This discrepancy indicates that the function is not behaving as expected and is returning the wrong status code.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the check for the scheme in the Authorization header. The function expects the scheme to be "bearer" in lowercase, but the test case is sending "Basic" as the scheme.

The bug occurs because the function is not handling the case where the scheme in the Authorization header is not "bearer" properly. The function should return a 403 status code with the detail "Invalid authentication credentials" when the scheme is not "bearer".

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to check for the correct scheme and return the appropriate status code and details.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
