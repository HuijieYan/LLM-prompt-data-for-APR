The error is occurring because the function is not handling the case where the scheme in the Authorization header is not "bearer" properly. In the given test case, the scheme is "Basic" instead of "bearer", so the function should return a 403 status code with an appropriate error message.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle the case where the scheme is not "bearer" and return a 403 status code with the error message "Invalid authentication credentials".

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from fastapi import HTTPException, status
from starlette.requests import Request
from typing import Optional
from fastapi.security.base import HTTPAuthorizationCredentials
from fastapi.security.utils import get_authorization_scheme_param

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/fastapi_12/fastapi/security/http.py

async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=status.HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle the case where the scheme is not "bearer" and return a 403 status code with the appropriate error message. This should resolve the issue with the test case failing.
