The test_security_http_bearer_incorrect_scheme_credentials test case is trying to check if the response status code is 200, but it's encountering an assertion error because the actual status code is 403.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the if condition for checking the scheme. It checks if the scheme is not "bearer", and if it's not, it raises an HTTPException with status code 403.

The bug occurs because the authentication scheme in the provided headers is "Basic" instead of "Bearer". As a result, the buggy function correctly identifies the incorrect authentication scheme and raises an HTTPException with status code 403.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the code to not raise an exception for incorrect scheme but to return None instead, to allow for processing the request further in the application.

Here's the corrected and modified function:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class HTTPBearer(HTTPBase):
    # ... omitted code ...


    async def __call__(
        self, request: Request
    ) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
        authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
        scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
        if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
            if self.auto_error:
                raise HTTPException(
                    status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
                )
            else:
                return None
        if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
            return None
        return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

In the modified function, if the authentication scheme is not "Bearer", instead of raising an exception, it returns None to allow for further request processing.
