Potential error location: The issue is likely with the conditional logic in the `__call__` method of the `HTTPBearer` class.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the `__call__` method is not handling the case where the authorization scheme is not "bearer" correctly. When the authorization scheme is not "bearer", it should return a 403 error, but instead it returns a 200 status code, which causes the test to fail.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Update the conditional logic in the `__call__` method to handle the case where the authorization scheme is not "bearer" correctly, and return a 403 error in that case.

Here's the corrected code for the `__call__` method:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer" or not credentials:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

With this corrected code, the `__call__` method now handles the case where the authorization scheme is not "bearer" correctly, and returns a 403 error when needed.
