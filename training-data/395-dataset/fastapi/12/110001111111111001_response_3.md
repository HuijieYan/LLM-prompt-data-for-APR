The test case "test_security_http_bearer_incorrect_scheme_credentials" is sending a request to the "/users/me" endpoint with an "Authorization" header containing the value "Basic notreally". The expected behavior is that the response status code should be 200, but the actual status code is 403.

The buggy function is the "__call__" method of the HTTPBearer class. The issue lies in the check for the scheme. It currently checks if the scheme is "bearer", but it should be case-insensitive. 

The bug occurs because the function is not handling the case where the scheme is not "bearer" correctly. In the given scenario, the scheme is "basic", which leads to the HTTP 403 status code being returned.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to make the scheme check case-insensitive and handle non-"bearer" schemes appropriately.

Here is the corrected code for the "__call__" method of the HTTPBearer class:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None

    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
            )
        else:
            return None

    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
            )
        else:
            return None

    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

With this modification, the updated function now handles cases where the scheme is not "bearer" by returning a 403 status code with the appropriate message.
