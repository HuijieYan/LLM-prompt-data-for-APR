The bug in the provided code is that it is checking for the "bearer" scheme, but the actual authorization scheme in the header is "Basic". This causes the function to raise an exception and return "Invalid authentication credentials".

To fix this bug, we need to modify the code to check for the "Basic" scheme and return the credentials accordingly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)

    if scheme.lower() != "basic":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    else:
        return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
