The potential error in the provided function is that it does not handle the case where the authorization header is missing or does not have the correct format. This can lead to unexpected behavior or errors in the application.

To fix this issue, we can modify the function to check if the authorization header is present and in the correct format before attempting to extract the credentials.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if authorization is None:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    
    if not (scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
            )
        else:
            return None

    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

In this corrected code, we first check if the authorization header is present, and if not, we handle it according to the value of `self.auto_error`. Then, we proceed to extract the scheme and credentials from the authorization header and handle the case where they are not present or in the correct format. Finally, we check if the scheme is "bearer" before returning the credentials.
