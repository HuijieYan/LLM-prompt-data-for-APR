The error message from the test function indicates that the response status code is 403, but the test is expecting it to be 200.

Upon reviewing the provided code, the potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement checking the scheme. The bug is likely occurring because the function is not handling the case where the scheme is not "bearer" properly.

To fix this bug, the conditional statement checking the scheme needs to be modified to handle the case where the scheme is not "bearer" correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if authorization:
        scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
        if scheme and credentials:
            if scheme.lower() == "bearer":
                return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
            else:
                if self.auto_error:
                    raise HTTPException(
                        status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
                    )
                else:
                    return None
    if self.auto_error:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
        )
    else:
        return None
```

With this correction, the function will properly handle the case where the scheme is not "bearer", and the bug should be resolved.
