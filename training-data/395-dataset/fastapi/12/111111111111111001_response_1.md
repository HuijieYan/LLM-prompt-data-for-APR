The bug that needs to be fixed is related to the incorrect response status code being returned when the `test_security_http_bearer_incorrect_scheme_credentials` test case is executed. The test case expects a response status code of 200, but the actual response status code is 403.

The potential error location within the `__call__` method of the `HTTPBearer` class is identified in the following lines of code:
```python
if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
    raise HTTPException(
        status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
        detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
    )
```

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the buggy function is incorrectly raising an `HTTPException` with a status code of 403 when the authentication scheme is not "bearer". This causes the test case to fail as it expects a status code of 200.

To fix the bug, the code should be modified to only raise an `HTTPException` with a status code of 403 when the authentication is totally missing or the credentials are invalid, not just when the scheme is not "bearer".

Below is the corrected code for the `__call__` method of the `HTTPBearer` class:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    
    if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
            )
        else:
            return None

    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

By making the changes outlined above, the code should now correctly handle the authentication checks and return the expected response status codes for the test cases.
