The potential error location within the code is the handling of the 'Authorization' header. The code is expecting the authorization header to be in the "Bearer" format, but it is receiving it in the "Basic" format.

The bug is occurring because the code is not handling the case where the 'Authorization' header is in the "Basic" format instead of the expected "Bearer" format.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the "Basic" format in the 'Authorization' header and return an HTTPException when it is encountered.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from fastapi.security import HTTPBearer, HTTPAuthorizationCredentials
from fastapi import Request, HTTPException
from starlette.datastructures import Headers
from starlette.status import HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN

class CustomHTTPBearer(HTTPBearer):
    async def __call__(
        self, request: Request
    ) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
        authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
        if not authorization:
            if self.auto_error:
                raise HTTPException(
                    status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
                )
            else:
                return None
        scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
        if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
            if self.auto_error:
                raise HTTPException(
                    status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                    detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
                )
            else:
                return None
        return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the 'Authorization' header exists, and if not, return an error or None based on the value of 'auto_error'. Then, we check if the scheme is "bearer" and return the credentials if it is. If the scheme is not "bearer", we return an error or None based on the value of 'auto_error'. This ensures that the function handles both "Bearer" and "Basic" formats in the 'Authorization' header.
