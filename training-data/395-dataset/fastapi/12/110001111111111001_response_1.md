The test is trying to access the "/users/me" endpoint with an "Authorization" header using the "Basic" scheme. The expected behavior is to return a 403 status code and a specific message, indicating that the authentication credentials are invalid.

The potential error location is within the `__call__` method of the `HTTPBearer` class. The bug is likely due to the incorrect comparison of the authorization scheme. The function should return a 403 status code with a message indicating that the authentication credentials are invalid for the "Basic" scheme.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic for the authorization scheme needs to be adjusted. Instead of raising an exception only for the "bearer" scheme, it should also raise an exception for other schemes, such as "Basic" in this case. Additionally, the details of the HTTPException should be specific to the invalid credentials for the "Basic" scheme.

Here's the corrected code for the `__call__` method of the `HTTPBearer` class:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication scheme or credentials",
        )
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

With this modification, the `__call__` method will now properly handle the "Basic" scheme and return a 403 status code with a specific message for invalid authentication credentials.
