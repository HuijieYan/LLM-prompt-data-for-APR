Potential Bug:
The potential bug in the provided function is that it does not handle the case where the authorization scheme is not "Bearer" properly. The function raises an HTTPException with status code 403 in this case, but the test function expects a status code of 200 for this scenario.

Reason for Bug:
The bug occurred because the function did not handle the scenario where the authorization scheme is not "Bearer" correctly. Instead of returning the HTTPAuthorizationCredentials, it raises an HTTPException with status code 403, which contradicts the expected behavior in the test case.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to handle the scenario where the authorization scheme is not "Bearer" and return an appropriate response instead of raising an HTTPException with status code 403.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication scheme"
            )
        else:
            return None
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
With this corrected code, the function will handle scenarios where the authorization scheme is not "Bearer" and return the appropriate response, matching the expected behavior in the test case.
