The potential error location in the code is at the line `scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)`. This suggests that the `get_authorization_scheme_param` function is being used but has not been defined or imported in the code. This is likely the reason for the bug as the function depends on `get_authorization_scheme_param`.

To fix the bug, we need to define or import the `get_authorization_scheme_param` function. Once this is done, the function should work as intended.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# corrected function
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
            )
        else:
            return None
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
