Potential error location: The potential error location is in the `__call__` method of the `HTTPBearer` class. The bug seems to be related to the validation of the authorization scheme.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the `__call__` method does not handle the case where the authorization scheme is not "bearer" correctly. The test case is expecting a 200 status code, but it is receiving a 403 status code, indicating that the authentication is failing.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The bug can be fixed by properly validating the authorization scheme and returning the appropriate HTTP status code and response if the validation fails.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
            )
        else:
            return None
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
