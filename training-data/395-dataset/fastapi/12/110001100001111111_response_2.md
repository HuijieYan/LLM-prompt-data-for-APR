The buggy function is designed to handle HTTP bearer token authorization. However, the function incorrectly checks for the 'bearer' scheme and raises an exception for any other scheme, even if the credentials are present and valid.

The potential error location within the code is the if statement checking for the scheme. It should only raise an exception if the credentials are missing or invalid, not based solely on the scheme.

The bug occurs because the function is not properly checking the credentials before raising an exception. It incorrectly assumes that a non-'bearer' scheme should result in an exception, regardless of the validity of the credentials.

To fix the bug, the function should first check if the credentials are valid before raising an exception based on the scheme. It should only raise an exception if the credentials are missing or invalid.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() == "bearer" and credentials:
        return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
    else:
        raise HTTPException(
            status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
            detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
        )
```
