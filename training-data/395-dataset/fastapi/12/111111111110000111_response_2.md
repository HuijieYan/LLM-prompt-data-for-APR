Potential error location: The bug is likely located in the `__call__` method of the `HTTPBearer` class. The error message from the test function indicates that the expected status code is 200, but the actual status code is 403. This suggests that the authentication is failing when it should not be.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug is likely occurring because the `__call__` method is not correctly handling the authorization for the "Basic" scheme. It is only checking for the "Bearer" scheme and not handling other types of authorization schemes properly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The `__call__` method should be modified to handle different authorization schemes, not just "Bearer". It should also handle the case where the authorization header is missing or improperly formatted.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
            )
        else:
            return None
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
