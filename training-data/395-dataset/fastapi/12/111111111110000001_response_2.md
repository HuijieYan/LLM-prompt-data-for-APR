Potential error location:
The error seems to be occurring in the test case `test_security_http_bearer_incorrect_scheme_credentials` when it asserts that the response status code is 200, but it actually receives a status code of 403.

Reason for the bug:
The bug is likely occurring within the `HTTPBearer` class, specifically in the `__call__` method. The method is not handling the case where the authorization scheme is not "bearer" correctly, resulting in a 403 status code being returned in the test.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
The bug can be fixed by properly handling the case where the authorization scheme is not "bearer" and returning an appropriate response.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    
    if not (scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
            )
        else:
            return None
    
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
            )
        else:
            return None
    
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

With this corrected code, the function now properly handles cases where the authorization scheme is not "bearer" and returns the appropriate responses.
