Potential error: The function is intended to extract the "Authorization" header from the request and parse the credentials. However, the current implementation does not handle the case where the "Authorization" header is missing.

Reason for the bug: The current implementation does not account for the absence of the "Authorization" header, leading to potential errors or unexpected behavior.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We need to modify the function to properly handle the case where the "Authorization" header is missing by checking for its presence before attempting to extract credentials.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/fastapi_12/fastapi/security/http.py

# class declaration containing the fixed function
class HTTPBearer(HTTPBase):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # corrected function
    async def __call__(
        self, request: Request
    ) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
        authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
        if not authorization:
            if self.auto_error:
                raise HTTPException(
                    status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
                )
            else:
                return None

        scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
        if not (scheme and credentials):
            if self.auto_error:
                raise HTTPException(
                    status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Invalid authentication credentials"
                 )
            else:
                return None
        
        if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
            )
        return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
