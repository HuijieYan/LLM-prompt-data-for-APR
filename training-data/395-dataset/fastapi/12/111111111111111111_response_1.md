The error occurs because the test is expecting a status code of 200, but the actual status code returned is 403. This indicates that the authentication is failing, and the function is returning a 403 status code instead of an error message.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for handling an incorrect authentication scheme.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function does not handle the case when the authentication scheme is not "bearer" properly. Instead of returning an error message, it directly raises an HTTPException with a 403 status code.

To fix the bug, the function should return an error message with a 403 status code when the authentication scheme is not "bearer" and credentials are provided.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    if not (authorization and scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
            )
        else:
            return None
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```
