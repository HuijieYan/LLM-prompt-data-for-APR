The test function `test_security_http_bearer_incorrect_scheme_credentials` is trying to make a request with an "Authorization" header using the "Basic" scheme, but the expected behavior is not clear. The error message indicates that the response status code is 403, but the test expects it to be 200.

It seems like the issue lies in the `__call__` method of the security HTTP bearer implementation. The method is supposed to handle the authentication using the "Bearer" scheme, but the code is not handling the "Basic" scheme correctly.

The bug occurs because the code does not appropriately handle the case when the scheme in the Authorization header is not "Bearer". As a result, a 403 status code is returned, which is not expected by the test function.

To fix the bug, the code should be updated to check the scheme in the Authorization header and return a 403 status code only if it is "Bearer". For other schemes, the function should return an appropriately descriptive error message and possibly a different status code.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def __call__(
    self, request: Request
) -> Optional[HTTPAuthorizationCredentials]:
    authorization: str = request.headers.get("Authorization")
    if not authorization:
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN, detail="Not authenticated"
            )
        else:
            return None
    
    scheme, credentials = get_authorization_scheme_param(authorization)
    
    if not (scheme and credentials):
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                detail="Invalid authentication credentials",
            )
        else:
            return None
    
    if scheme.lower() != "bearer":
        if self.auto_error:
            raise HTTPException(
                status_code=HTTP_403_FORBIDDEN,
                detail="Invalid authentication scheme",
            )
        else:
            return None
    
    return HTTPAuthorizationCredentials(scheme=scheme, credentials=credentials)
```

With these changes, the `__call__` method will handle different scenarios for the Authorization header, returning the appropriate status code and error message based on the scheme and presence of credentials.
