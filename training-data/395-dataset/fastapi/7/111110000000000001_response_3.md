The potential error in the provided code is the 'exc.errors()' call. The RequestValidationError object does not have a method called 'errors()', which is causing the bug.

The code is trying to access 'errors()' method on the RequestValidationError object, but the correct way to get the validation error details is by accessing the 'errors' attribute directly.

To fix the bug, the code should access the 'errors' attribute of the exception object directly instead of trying to call a non-existent method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from fastapi import Request, status
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from fastapi.exceptions import RequestValidationError

# corrected function
async def request_validation_exception_handler(request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=status.HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, 
        content={"detail": exc.errors}
    )
```
