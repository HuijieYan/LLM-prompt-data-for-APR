The potential error in the provided function is that `exc.errors` is being called as a method when it should be accessed as a property.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that `exc.errors` is a property of the `RequestValidationError` class, but it is being accessed as a method.

To fix the bug, the `exc.errors()` should be replaced with `exc.errors`.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors}
    )
```
