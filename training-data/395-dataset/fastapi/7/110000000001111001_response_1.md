The potential error in the given function is that `exc.errors` is being called as a method, when it should be accessed as an attribute.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that `exc.errors` is mistakenly being called as a method, but it is actually an attribute that should be accessed directly.

To fix the bug:
- Replace `exc.errors()` with `exc.errors` in the function code.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors}
    )
```
