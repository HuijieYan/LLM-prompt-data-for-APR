The potential error in the provided function is with the `exc.errors()` method. This method is likely being used incorrectly or does not exist, which is causing the function to fail.

It seems that the intention here is to retrieve the error details from the `RequestValidationError` object 'exc'. However, calling `exc.errors()` directly is not the correct way to access the error details.

To fix this issue, you need to access the `errors()` method of the `exc` object in the correct way and pass the errors to the JSONResponse content.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from fastapi import Request, HTTPException, status
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from fastapi.exceptions import RequestValidationError

async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=status.HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, 
        content={"detail": exc.errors()}
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `status_code` is set using `status.HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY`, and the `content` of the JSONResponse is set to `{"detail": exc.errors()}`. This will properly handle the request validation exception and return the error details in the response.
