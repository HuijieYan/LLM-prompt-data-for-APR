The potential error in the provided function is in the use of `exc.errors()` which is likely causing the 500 response code instead of the expected 422 validation error with an explanation of what was invalid.

The reason for the bug is that `exc.errors()` might not be returning the correct error details, resulting in the incorrect status code.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the `RequestValidationError` and return the correct status code along with the error details.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from fastapi import Request, HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY
from fastapi.exceptions import RequestValidationError
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse

async def request_validation_exception_handler(request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError) -> JSONResponse:
    errors = exc.errors()
    error_messages = []

    for error in errors:
        for error_detail in error.get("loc"):
            error_messages.append(
                {
                    "loc": str(error_detail),
                    "msg": error.get("msg"),
                    "type": error.get("type")
                }
            )

    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": error_messages}
    )
```

This corrected code now properly loops through the error details and constructs a list of error messages with location, message, and type. It then returns a 422 status code along with the error messages. This should address the issue and return the expected 422 response with an explanation of what was invalid.
