The error occurs because the `exc.errors` method returns a `ValidationError` object, which is not JSON serializable. The `JSONResponse` class tries to serialize the `exc.errors` method as part of the response content, leading to the `TypeError` during serialization.

To fix this issue, we need to return the error details in a form that is JSON serializable. We can achieve this by extracting the error information from the `errors` method of the `RequestValidationError` object and returning it as a dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_validation_exception_handler` function:

```python
from fastapi import Request
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from starlette.status import HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY

async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    error_details = []
    for error in exc.errors():
        error_detail = {
            "loc": error["loc"],
            "msg": error["msg"],
            "type": error["type"],
            "ctx": error["ctx"]
        }
        error_details.append(error_detail)
    
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": error_details}
    )
```

In the corrected function, we extract the error details from the `errors` method of the `RequestValidationError` object and format them into a list of dictionaries, `error_details`. We then return this list as the content of the `JSONResponse`, making sure that it is JSON serializable.
