Potential Error Location: 
The issue seems to be with the line `detail": exc.errors()` where `errors` is being called as a method instead of accessing it as an attribute.

Reason for the Bug:
The `errors` attribute of the `RequestValidationError` should be accessed like an attribute, not as a method.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
Access the `errors` attribute of the `RequestValidationError` directly without using parentheses as if it were a method.

Corrected Code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/fastapi_7/fastapi/exception_handlers.py

# corrected function
async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors}
    )
```
