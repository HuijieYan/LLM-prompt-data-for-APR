Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the line `content={"detail": exc.errors()}` where the `exc.errors` is being called as a method, but it is actually an attribute that needs to be accessed directly.

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs because `exc.errors` is being treated as a callable method, but it is actually an attribute that holds the validation errors.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Access the `exc.errors` attribute directly rather than calling it as a method.

Corrected code:

```python
from fastapi import HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, Request
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from fastapi.exceptions import RequestValidationError

async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors}
    )
```
