The issue seems to be related to how FastAPI handles validation errors for decimal constraints. The `RequestValidationError` should return a 422 status code along with an explanation of what is invalid about the number, but it is currently resulting in a 500 internal server error.

The `request_validation_exception_handler` function is responsible for handling validation errors and returning a JSON response with the appropriate status code and content. However, the current implementation seems to be returning a 500 status code instead of a 422 for certain validation errors, particularly those related to decimal constraints.

To fix this issue, the `request_validation_exception_handler` function should be modified to correctly handle the `RequestValidationError` and return a 422 status code along with an explanation of the validation error.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# corrected function
async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    error_detail = exc.errors()[0]  # Assuming only one error for simplicity
    error_msg = error_detail["msg"]
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": error_msg}
    )
```

In the corrected function, we retrieve the error message from the `RequestValidationError` and use it as the content of the JSON response. We also set the status code to 422 to indicate a validation error.

By making these changes, the `request_validation_exception_handler` function should now correctly handle `RequestValidationError` and return a 422 response with an explanation of the validation error.
