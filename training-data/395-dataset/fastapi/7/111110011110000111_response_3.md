The error message indicates that there is an issue with serializing a Decimal object, which likely means that there is an attempt to include a Decimal object in the response content, which is not serializable to JSON.

The issue is likely occurring in the `request_validation_exception_handler` function, where the `exc.errors()` method is called. This method likely returns a Decimal object, which is then included in the response content. Since Decimal is not serializable to JSON, it results in a TypeError.

To fix this issue, you can convert the Decimal object to a serializable format before including it in the response content. This can be done by converting the Decimal object to a float or string. 

Here's the corrected code for the `request_validation_exception_handler` function:

```python
from decimal import Decimal

async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    error_details = exc.errors()
    # Convert Decimal objects to string for serialization
    for key, value in error_details.items():
        if isinstance(value, Decimal):
            error_details[key] = str(value)
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": error_details}
    )
```

In the corrected code, we loop through the error details and convert any Decimal objects to string using the `str()` method before including them in the response content. This ensures that the response content is serializable to JSON and the issue should be resolved.
