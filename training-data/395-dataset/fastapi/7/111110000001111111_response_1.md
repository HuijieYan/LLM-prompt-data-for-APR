The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of the RequestValidationError in the `request_validation_exception_handler` function. The function is currently returning a 500 internal server error instead of a 422 validation error with an explanation of what was invalid.

The error likely occurs because the function is trying to call `exc.errors()` as a method, which is not the correct way to access the errors in a RequestValidationError object. Instead, we should directly access the `exc.errors` attribute to get the error details.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to access the `exc.errors` attribute directly and return a JSONResponse with the correct status code and content.

```python
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from fastapi import HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, Request
from pydantic.error_wrappers import RequestValidationError

async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors}
    )
```
