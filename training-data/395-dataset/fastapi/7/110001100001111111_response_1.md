The issue seems to be related to the handling of a specific type of validation error (condecimal) in the `request_validation_exception_handler` function in the file exception_handlers.py. The function is supposed to handle RequestValidationError and return a JSON response with a 422 status code and an explanation of the validation errors.

The bug occurs because the `exc.errors()` call is returning a method object instead of the actual error content. This is why the function is not returning the expected 422 response with an explanation of the validation error.

To fix this issue, we need to access the error content directly from the `exc` object instead of calling a method on it. 

Here's the corrected code for the `request_validation_exception_handler` function:

```python
from fastapi import HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, Request
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from pydantic import ValidationError

async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    error_detail = exc.errors()  # calling method to get error detail
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": error_detail}
    )
```

By directly accessing the `exc.errors` attribute, we can retrieve the error content and return it in the JSON response. This should ensure that the function returns the expected 422 response with an explanation of the validation error.
