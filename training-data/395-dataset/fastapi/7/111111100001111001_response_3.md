Potential Error: The function is trying to access the `exc.errors` attribute as a method, but it should be accessed as a property.

Reason for the Bug: The `exc.errors` attribute is being accessed as a method, but it should be accessed as a property to retrieve the error details.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
- Update the way `exc.errors` is accessed to retrieve the error details properly.
- Use the `await` keyword if `exc.errors` is an async method and needs to be awaited.

Corrected Code:
```python
from fastapi import Request
from fastapi.exceptions import RequestValidationError
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from starlette.status import HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY

async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors},
    )
```
