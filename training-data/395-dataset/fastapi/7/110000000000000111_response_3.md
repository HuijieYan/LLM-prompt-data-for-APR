The issue seems to be related to the handling of validation errors in FastAPI when using condecimal type with Pydantic. The current function `request_validation_exception_handler` is intended to handle RequestValidationError exceptions by returning a 422 status code along with an explanation of what was invalid. However, it seems that the function is not properly handling the validation errors for condecimal type.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line that attempts to retrieve the error message from the exception using `exc.errors()`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely that the `exc.errors()` method is not correctly providing the error message for the condecimal validation error.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to properly handle condecimal validation errors and extract the error message from the exception object.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from fastapi import Request
from pydantic import errors
from starlette.status import HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY

async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: errors.RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    detail = exc.errors()
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": detail}
    )
```

In the corrected function:
1. We import `errors` from `pydantic` to ensure that we are using the correct exception class.
2. We retrieve the error message using `exc.errors()` and assign it to the `detail` variable.
3. We return a JSONResponse with the correct status code and the extracted error message in the "detail" field.
