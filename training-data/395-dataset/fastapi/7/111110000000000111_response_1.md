The issue seems to be related to the handling of validation errors when using condecimal in FastAPI. The bug occurs when an invalid condecimal is sent to a FastAPI service, causing it to return a 500 internal server error instead of a 422 validation error with an explanation of what was invalid.

The potential error location is within the `request_validation_exception_handler` function, where it returns a JSONResponse with an incorrect status code.

The reason behind the bug is that the function is not properly handling the RequestValidationError when it occurs. Instead of returning a 422 status code along with an explanation of what is invalid, it is returning a 500 internal server error.

To fix the bug, the `request_validation_exception_handler` function needs to be modified to properly handle the RequestValidationError and return a 422 status code along with an explanation of the validation error.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_validation_exception_handler` function:

```python
async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, 
        content={"detail": exc.errors()}
    )
```

With this correction, the function will now return a 422 status code along with an explanation of what is invalid when a RequestValidationError occurs. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
