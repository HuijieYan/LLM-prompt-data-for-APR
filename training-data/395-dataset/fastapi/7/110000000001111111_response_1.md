The error is likely occurring in the function `request_validation_exception_handler` where it returns a 500 response code instead of a 422 with an explanation of what was invalid when an invalid condecimal is sent to the FastAPI service.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code is returning a 500 response code instead of a 422 with an explanation of what was invalid.

To fix the bug, the `request_validation_exception_handler` function needs to be updated to handle the `RequestValidationError` correctly and return a 422 response with an explanation of what was invalid.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected function
async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, 
        content={"detail": exc.errors()}
    )
```
