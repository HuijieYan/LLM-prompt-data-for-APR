The issue with the given function is that `exc.errors` is being called as a method when it should be accessed as an attribute to retrieve the error details.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that `exc.errors` is a property of the `RequestValidationError` class and should be accessed directly without being called as a method.

To fix the bug, we need to access `exc.errors` directly as an attribute without the parentheses.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from fastapi import Request
from starlette.status import HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY
from pydantic import ValidationError

async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: ValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors}
    )
```

In the corrected code, I removed the method call for `exc.errors()` and just accessed `exc.errors` directly as an attribute.
