The issue seems to be related to how request validation exceptions are handled in FastAPI. The provided function `request_validation_exception_handler` is responsible for handling validation errors and returning a JSON response with the details of the error.

The bug seems to be in the content returned by this function when handling a request validation error due to an invalid condecimal.

The potential error location is the line:
```python
content={"detail": exc.errors()}
```

The `exc.errors()` method is likely not providing the error details as expected, resulting in incorrect content in the JSON response.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to extract the error details from the `RequestValidationError` object and include those details in the JSON response.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_validation_exception_handler` function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/fastapi_7/fastapi/exception_handlers.py

from fastapi import Request, HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from fastapi.exceptions import RequestValidationError

async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    error_messages = []
    for error in exc.errors():
        error_messages.append({error['loc'][1]: error['msg']})

    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": "Validation error", "errors": error_messages}
    )
```

In this corrected function, we loop through each error in the `RequestValidationError` and create a dictionary with the error location and message. We then return a JSON response with the status code 422 and include the detailed error messages in the response content.

This fix should ensure that when an invalid condecimal is sent to a FastAPI service, the correct 422 response along with an explanation of what is invalid about the number, as expected in the issue description, will be returned.
