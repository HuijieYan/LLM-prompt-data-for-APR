The issue here is that when an invalid Condecimal value is sent to a FastAPI service, the service returns a 500 internal server error instead of a 422 validation error with an explanation of what was invalid.

It seems that the problem lies in the request_validation_exception_handler function. The issue is likely due to how the exc.errors method is being handled.

To fix this bug, we need to access the list of errors and return them in the response content. 

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from fastapi import HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, Request
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from fastapi.exceptions import RequestValidationError

async def request_validation_exception_handler(request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError) -> JSONResponse:
    error_msgs = [{"loc": error["loc"], "msg": error["msg"], "type": error["type"], "ctx": error["ctx"]} for error in exc.errors()]
    return JSONResponse(status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": error_msgs})
```

In the corrected function, exc.errors() is called to retrieve the list of error dictionaries and then transformed into a list of error messages to be returned in the response. This change ensures that the 422 response with an explanation of what was invalid is returned, as expected.
