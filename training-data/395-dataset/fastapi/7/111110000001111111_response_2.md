The issue is with the way the function handles the RequestValidationError. The function is returning a 422 response with an attempt to access the errors as a method, which is incorrect.

The correction needed is to access the errors attribute directly instead of treating it as a method.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors}
    )
```
