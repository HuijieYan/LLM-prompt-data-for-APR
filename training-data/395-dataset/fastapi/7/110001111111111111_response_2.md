The bug occurs in the `request_validation_exception_handler` function, where the `exc.errors()` method is being called. The issue is caused by the fact that the `exc.errors()` method returns a `ValidationError` object, which contains a Decimal object that cannot be serialized to JSON, causing a TypeError.

To fix this bug, the `exc.errors` method should be accessed directly to extract the errors. Then, the errors can be serialized to JSON to be included in the response.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from fastapi import HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, Request
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from pydantic import ValidationError

async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: ValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors()}
    )
```

In this corrected function, the `ValidationError` type is explicitly imported from `pydantic` and used in the function signature. The `exc.errors()` method is directly accessed to provide the details of the validation error in the JSON response. This should fix the bug and prevent the TypeError from occurring.
