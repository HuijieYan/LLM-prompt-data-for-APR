Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the function is the call to `exc.errors()`, which should be `exc.errors`.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurred because the `errors()` method is being incorrectly called on the `exc` object. It should be `exc.errors` instead.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Replace `exc.errors()` with `exc.errors`.
2. Ensure that the HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY constant is defined in the code.

Corrected Code:
```python
# this is the corrected function
async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors}
    )
```
