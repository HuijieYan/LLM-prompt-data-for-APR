The bug is likely occurring due to the incorrect usage of the `exc.errors()` method. This method is being called as if it were a function, but it should be accessed as an attribute of the `RequestValidationError` object.

To fix this bug, you should remove the parentheses from `exc.errors()` and access the attribute directly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors}
    )
```

This should resolve the issue and return the expected 422 response along with an explanation of what is invalid, as per the bug details provided.
