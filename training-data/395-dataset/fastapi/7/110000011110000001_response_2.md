The error message indicates a problem with serializing a `Decimal` object to JSON. The issue is most likely in the line `exc.errors()` within the `request_validation_exception_handler` function. The `Decimal` type is not JSON serializable by default, and the function is trying to include it in the response content.

To fix this issue, we should convert the `Decimal` object to a serializable format before including it in the response content. One approach is to convert the `Decimal` object to a float before creating the response. This can be achieved using the `decimal.Decimal` module.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_validation_exception_handler` function:

```python
from decimal import Decimal

async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    errors = []
    for field, error in exc.errors():
        if isinstance(error, Decimal):
            # Convert Decimal to float
            error = float(error)
        errors.append((field, error))
        
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": errors}
    )
```

In this corrected code, we iterate through the errors and check if any of them are of type `Decimal`. If so, we convert them to float before including them in the response content. This ensures that the response content only includes JSON-serializable data.
