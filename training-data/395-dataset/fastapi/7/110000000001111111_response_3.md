The bug in the provided function is that exc.errors is being called as a method, but it is not a method. It is actually an attribute that contains a list of errors. This is causing the function to return a 500 internal server error instead of a 422 validation error.

To fix this bug, we need to access the errors attribute directly and return the content with the list of errors in the JSONResponse.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from fastapi import HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, Request, HTTPException
from fastapi.responses import JSONResponse
from pydantic import ValidationError

async def request_validation_exception_handler(
    request: Request, exc: RequestValidationError
) -> JSONResponse:
    return JSONResponse(
        status_code=HTTP_422_UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY, content={"detail": exc.errors}
    )
```

In this corrected code, we are directly accessing the errors attribute of the exc object and passing it to the content of the JSONResponse. This will ensure that the function returns a 422 validation error along with an explanation of what is invalid about the request.
