Based on the error messages and the associated detailed issue descriptions, the issue is with the `serialize_response` function. The issue occurs when errors are raised for missing fields while trying to serialize the response using the `jsonable_encoder` function. This prevents the correct response from being generated and results in a validation error.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the response content properly when using pydantic models with aliases, and it does not respect the `response_model_exclude_unset` option.

To fix this bug, the following approaches can be taken:
1. Check if the response content is a pydantic model and apply any relevant changes, such as using the `dict()` method with `by_alias=True`.
2. Ensure that the correct response is generated even when using pydantic models with aliases and that the `response_model_exclude_unset` option is respected.

Here's the corrected `serialize_response` function:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from typing import Any, Union, Set, Dict, List

async def serialize_response(
    field: ModelField = None,
    response_content: Any,
    include: Union[Set[str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
    exclude: Union[Set[str], Dict[str, Any]] = set(),
    by_alias: bool = True,
    exclude_unset: bool = False,
    is_coroutine: bool = True,
) -> Any:
    if field:
        errors = []

        # Handling exclude_unset for BaseModel response_content
        if exclude_unset and isinstance(response_content, BaseModel):
            response_content = response_content.dict(exclude_unset=exclude_unset)

        # Check if the response content is a pydantic model and apply alias handling
        if isinstance(response_content, BaseModel):
            if by_alias:
                response_content = response_content.dict(by_alias=by_alias)

        if is_coroutine:
            value, errors_ = field.validate(response_content, {}, loc=("response",))
        else:
            value, errors_ = await run_in_threadpool(
                field.validate, response_content, {}, loc=("response",)
            )

        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)

        if errors:
            raise ValidationError(errors, field.type_)

        return jsonable_encoder(
            value,
            include=include,
            exclude=exclude,
            by_alias=by_alias,
            exclude_unset=exclude_unset,
        )
    else:
        return jsonable_encoder(response_content)
```
In this corrected code, we handle `exclude_unset` correctly for BaseModel response content and ensure that alias handling is performed when the response content is a pydantic model. By applying these checks and modifications, we ensure that the correct response is generated, taking into account the alias definitions and the `response_model_exclude_unset` option.
