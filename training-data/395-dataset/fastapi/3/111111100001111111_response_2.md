The error occurs because the response is not respecting the `response_model_exclude_unset` when returning a list of models, as described in the first issue. 

The potential error location is in the `serialize_response` function, particularly in the block of code where the response content is manipulated and the `response_model_exclude_unset` is not properly considered when the field is a list of models.

To fix this bug, the code needs to be updated to properly handle the situation when a list of models is returned and `response_model_exclude_unset` is set to True.

Here's the corrected code for the `serialize_response` function:

```python
async def serialize_response(
    *,
    field: ModelField = None,
    response_content: Any,
    include: Union[SetIntStr, DictIntStrAny] = None,
    exclude: Union[SetIntStr, DictIntStrAny] = set(),
    by_alias: bool = True,
    exclude_unset: bool = False,
    is_coroutine: bool = True,
) -> Any:
    if isinstance(response_content, list):
        values = []
        for item in response_content:
            if exclude_unset and isinstance(item, BaseModel):
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    values.append(item.dict(exclude_unset=exclude_unset))
                else:
                    values.append(item.dict(skip_defaults=exclude_unset))  # pragma: nocover
            else:
                values.append(item)
        return jsonable_encoder(
            values,
            include=include,
            exclude=exclude,
            by_alias=by_alias,
            exclude_unset=exclude_unset,
        )
    elif field:
        # rest of the function remains the same
    else:
        return jsonable_encoder(response_content)
```

This fix includes a conditional block to check if the `response_content` is a list of models, in which case the internal values are manipulated to respect the `response_model_exclude_unset` setting.
