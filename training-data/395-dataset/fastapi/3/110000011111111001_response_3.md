The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the handling of the `response_content` parameter. The function is failing to validate the content properly and raises `ValidationError` even when the content is valid.

The potential error location within the `serialize_response` function could be the validation logic for the `response_content`. The function is using `field.validate` to validate the response content, and there might be an issue with how the validation is being performed asynchronously.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be related to improper handling of `is_coroutine` and the validation process for the response content. The function is not correctly handling the asynchronous validation process for different types of content.

To fix this bug, we can modify the validation logic to properly handle the asynchronous validation for the response content based on the type of content and the `is_coroutine` parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the `serialize_response` function:

```python
from typing import Any, Union, Set, Dict
from pydantic.fields import ModelField
from pydantic.main import BaseModel
from pydantic.json import pydantic_encoder
from pydantic import ValidationError

async def serialize_response(
    *,
    field: ModelField = None,
    response_content: Any,
    include: Union[Set[str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
    exclude: Union[Set[str], Dict[str, Any]] = set(),
    by_alias: bool = True,
    exclude_unset: bool = False,
    is_coroutine: bool = True,
) -> Any:
    if field:
        if exclude_unset and isinstance(response_content, BaseModel):
            response_content = response_content.dict(
                include=include,
                exclude=exclude,
                by_alias=by_alias,
                exclude_unset=exclude_unset
            )
        if is_coroutine:
            value, errors = await field.validate_always(response_content)
        else:
            value, errors = field.validate_always(response_content)
        if errors:
            raise ValidationError(errors, field.type_)
        return jsonable_encoder(
            value,
            include=include,
            exclude=exclude,
            by_alias=by_alias,
            exclude_unset=exclude_unset
        )
    else:
        return jsonable_encoder(response_content)
```

In the corrected code:
- The validation process for the `response_content` parameter is modified to handle asynchronous validation using the `validate_always` method for both coroutine and non-coroutine scenarios.
- The return statement also includes the proper use of `jsonable_encoder` for serializing the validated value.

Please note that the corrected code assumes the availability of certain functions and import statements. If those are not present, they should be added accordingly.
