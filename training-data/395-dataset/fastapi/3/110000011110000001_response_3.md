The function `serialize_response` is raising `ValidationError` errors for all the test cases which indicates that the response is not being serialized correctly. The function is not handling the input parameters and the response content properly which is leading to the errors.

The potential error location is within the conditional block at the start of the function. In this block, it checks if the `field` parameter has a value. If it does, it attempts to go through a series of checks and validations. The issue may be within this conditional block itself.

The `serialize_response` function is encountering issues due to inconsistent handling of the input parameters and the response content. This might be due to improper checks for null values, incorrect validation, or inconsistent handling of coroutine and non-coroutine usage.

To fix the bug, the `serialize_response` function needs to properly handle the input parameters and the response content. It should check for null values, validate the content, and handle both coroutine and non-coroutine usage uniformly.

Here's how the corrected code for the `serialize_response` function may look:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Json
from typing import Union, Set, Dict, Any

async def serialize_response(
    *,
    field: ModelField = None,
    response_content: Any,
    include: Union[Set[str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
    exclude: Union[Set[str], Dict[str, Any]] = None,
    by_alias: bool = True,
    exclude_unset: bool = False,
    is_coroutine: bool = False,
) -> Any:
    if field:
        errors = []
        if exclude_unset and isinstance(response_content, BaseModel):
            response_content = response_content.dict(exclude_unset=exclude_unset)
        if is_coroutine:
            value, errors_ = await field.validate(response_content, {}, loc=("response",))
        else:
            value, errors_ = field.validate(response_content, {}, loc=("response",))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        if errors:
            raise ValidationError(errors, field.type_)
        return JsonableEncoder.encode(
            value,
            include=include,
            exclude=exclude,
            by_alias=by_alias,
            exclude_unset=exclude_unset
        )
    else:
        return JsonableEncoder.encode(response_content)
```

In the corrected code:
- The input parameter types are fixed and made consistent, and default values are handled properly.
- The conditional checks are simplified and made consistent for both coroutine and non-coroutine usage.
- The response content is handled uniformly and sent through the correct encoding process using `JsonableEncoder`.

This should address the issues with the function `serialize_response` and resolve the `ValidationError` errors in the test cases.
