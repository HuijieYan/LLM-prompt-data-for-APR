In both issues, it seems that the bug is related to the handling of response models in FastAPI, specifically when using aliases and when returning a list of models. Both issues are related to the serialization of response models with specific configurations.

In the first issue, the bug causes the response to include unset key/values when `response_model_exclude_unset` is set to True when returning a list of models.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `serialize_response` function, where the response content is not being properly serialized based on the provided response model configuration.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function does not handle the serialization of response models with `response_model_exclude_unset` set to True when returning a list of models.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug would be to properly handle the exclusion of unset fields when serializing a list of response models based on the `response_model_exclude_unset` configuration. This would involve checking for list types and applying the exclusion to each model individually.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from typing import Any, Union, List
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field
from fastapi.encoders import jsonable_encoder
from pydantic.fields import ModelField

async def serialize_response(
    field: ModelField = None,
    response_content: Any,
    include: Union[SetIntStr, DictIntStrAny] = None,
    exclude: Union[SetIntStr, DictIntStrAny] = set(),
    by_alias: bool = True,
    exclude_unset: bool = False,
    is_coroutine: bool = True,
) -> Any:
    if field:
        errors = []
        if exclude_unset and isinstance(response_content, BaseModel):
            if PYDANTIC_1:
                response_content = response_content.dict(exclude_unset=exclude_unset, by_alias=by_alias)
            else:
                response_content = response_content.dict(skip_defaults=exclude_unset, by_alias=by_alias)  # pragma: nocover
        if exclude_unset and isinstance(response_content, list) and all(isinstance(item, BaseModel) for item in response_content):
            response_content = [item.dict(exclude_unset=exclude_unset, by_alias=by_alias) for item in response_content]
        if is_coroutine:
            value, errors_ = field.validate(response_content, {}, loc=("response",))
        else:
            value, errors_ = await run_in_threadpool(
                field.validate, response_content, {}, loc=("response",)
            )
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        if errors:
            raise ValidationError(errors, field.type_)
        return jsonable_encoder(
            value,
            include=include,
            exclude=exclude,
            by_alias=by_alias,
            exclude_unset=exclude_unset,
        )
    else:
        return jsonable_encoder(response_content)
```

This correction includes additional handling for list types to ensure that exclusion of unset fields is applied when serializing a list of response models.
