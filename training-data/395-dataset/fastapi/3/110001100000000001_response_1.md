Potential error location: The potentially problematic code is in the `serialize_response` function, specifically in the condition `if is_coroutine:` and the subsequent `else` block.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The `is_coroutine` argument is being used conditionally to decide whether to run the validation task as a coroutine or not.
2. In the conditional branch for `is_coroutine`, the variable `errors_` is not being awaited, which could lead to unexpected behavior if the validation task is supposed to be executed as a coroutine.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the code to ensure that the `errors_` variable is awaited in the conditional branch when `is_coroutine` is true.
2. Check the implementation of `run_in_threadpool` and ensure that it properly handles coroutine execution.

Corrected code:

```python
from typing import Any, Union, Dict

async def serialize_response(
    field: ModelField = None,
    response_content: Any,
    include: Union[SetIntStr, DictIntStrAny] = None,
    exclude: Union[SetIntStr, DictIntStrAny] = set(),
    by_alias: bool = True,
    exclude_unset: bool = False,
    is_coroutine: bool = True,
) -> Any:
    if field:
        errors = []
        if exclude_unset and isinstance(response_content, BaseModel):
            if PYDANTIC_1:
                response_content = response_content.dict(exclude_unset=exclude_unset)
            else:
                response_content = response_content.dict(
                    skip_defaults=exclude_unset
                )  # pragma: nocover
        if is_coroutine:
            value, errors_ = await field.validate(response_content, {}, loc=("response",))
        else:
            value, errors_ = run_in_threadpool(
                await field.validate, response_content, {}, loc=("response",)
            )
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        if errors:
            raise ValidationError(errors, field.type_)
        return jsonable_encoder(
            value,
            include=include,
            exclude=exclude,
            by_alias=by_alias,
            exclude_unset=exclude_unset,
        )
    else:
        return jsonable_encoder(response_content)
