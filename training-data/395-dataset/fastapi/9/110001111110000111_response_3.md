The test_openapi_schema function is comparing the requestBody of the GET endpoint response with the expected create_product_request_body and create_shop_request_body. The error message indicates a mismatch in the media type defined in the request body content.

The potential error in the function get_body_field is related to the assignment of the media type (BodySchema) for the request body. It seems that the function is not properly assigning the media type based on the body_params.

The bug is occurring because the function get_body_field is not properly setting the media type of the request body based on the content type of the parameters. Instead, it seems to default to using application/json as the media type for the request body, causing a mismatch with the expected media type in the openapi.json.

To fix the bug, the function get_body_field should be modified to properly determine the media type based on the content types of the body_params. This can be achieved by iterating through the body_params and checking their content types to determine the appropriate media type for the request body.

Here's the corrected code for the get_body_field function:

```python
def get_body_field(*, dependant: Dependant, name: str) -> Optional[Field]:
    flat_dependant = get_flat_dependant(dependant)
    if not flat_dependant.body_params:
        return None
    
    media_types = {
        "application/json": params.Body,
        "application/vnd.api+json": params.Form,
        # Add more media types as needed
    }
    
    media_type = next((media_type for media_type in media_types if any(isinstance(f.schema, media_types[media_type]) for f in flat_dependant.body_params)), "application/json")
    
    model_name = "Body_" + name
    BodyModel = create_model(model_name)
    for f in flat_dependant.body_params:
        BodyModel.__fields__[f.name] = get_schema_compatible_field(field=f)
        
    required = any(True for f in flat_dependant.body_params if f.required)
    
    field = Field(
        name="body",
        type_=BodyModel,
        default=None,
        required=required,
        model_config=BaseConfig,
        class_validators={},
        alias="body",
        schema=media_types[media_type](None),
    )
    return field
```

With the corrected code, the get_body_field function should now properly set the media type for the request body based on the content types of the body parameters, resolving the mismatch issue in the openapi.json.
