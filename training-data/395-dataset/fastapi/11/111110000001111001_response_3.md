The issue with the provided function is that it is checking for the `field.schema` not being an instance of `params.Body`, but in the expected outputs, it checks for an instance of `Query` instead. 

To fix this, we need to modify the condition to check for an instance of `Query` and also import the `Query` class if it's not already imported.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from fastapi.params import Query

def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, Query)
    )
```
