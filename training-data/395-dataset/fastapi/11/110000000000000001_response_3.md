Potential error location: The problematic line of code is the use of "lenient_issubclass" and "sequence_types" without being defined or imported in the function.

Reason for the bug: The error is occurring because the "lenient_issubclass" and "sequence_types" are being used without being defined or imported in the function. Additionally, the "BaseModel" and "params.Body" classes are also not imported or defined in the function, which will cause errors.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Import the necessary classes and functions, such as "BaseModel", "params.Body", "lenient_issubclass", and "sequence_types", at the beginning of the file or before the function definition.
2. Define the missing classes or functions if they are custom implementations.

Corrected code:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, shape
from fastapi import params

# Assuming definition of lenient_issubclass and sequence_types if they are custom implementations

def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
    )
```
This corrected code assumes that the necessary imports are made and the missing functions or classes are defined elsewhere in the codebase. If they are not, they should be imported or defined accordingly.
