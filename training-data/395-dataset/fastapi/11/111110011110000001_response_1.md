The error occurs because the provided function `is_scalar_field` has references to undefined classes and functions, such as `Field`, `Shape`, `BaseModel`, `lenient_issubclass`, and `sequence_types`. Additionally, the code snippet seems to be from the FastAPI framework, but without the required imports and dependencies, it's hard to understand and fix the function. Moreover, it seems the function is making use of Pydantic models and imports.

To fix the bug:
1. Correctly import the necessary classes and functions, including `Field`, `Shape`, `BaseModel`, `lenient_issubclass`, and `sequence_types`.
2. Ensure that the appropriate classes and functions are instantiated and called according to the correct syntax and semantics.

The corrected function might look like:

```python
from pydantic import Field
from pydantic.main import BaseModel
from pydantic.typing import Type
from pydantic import validator, root_validator
from typing import Dict, Any, Set, Tuple, TypeVar, Type, Optional, Union
from pydantic.collection import sequence_types
from fastapi import params

def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not BaseModel in getattr(field.type_, '__class__', ())
        and not any(issubclass(subtype, sequence_types + (dict,)) for subtype in getattr(field.type_, '__class__', ()))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
    )
```

Please note that the actual functionality of this function could not be fully restored without knowledge of the entire FastAPI framework's class definition and context. Therefore, the corrected function may not fully solve the issue without other required dependencies and definitions in place.
