The bug is located in the `is_scalar_field` function. The function is designed to check if a given field is a scalar field based on certain conditions. The bug is likely causing the function to return incorrect results, leading to failures in the test cases.

Upon analyzing the error messages from the test functions and checking the problematic function, it seems that the bug might be related to how the `is_scalar_field` function is checking the conditions for scalar fields. Specifically, the bug might be related to how the conditions are being evaluated for the `field.type_` and `field.schema`.

Possible reasons for the bug:
1. The evaluation of conditions for `field.type_` might not be correct, resulting in incorrect determination of scalar fields.
2. The evaluation of conditions for `field.schema` might not be exhaustive or accurate.

To fix the bug, the following changes need to be made to the `is_scalar_field` function:

```python
def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    # Check if the shape is singleton and the type is not a subclass of BaseModel or sequence types
    if (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Query)  # Assuming the correct type is `Query`, not `Body`
    ):
        return True  # It's a scalar field
    else:
        return False  # It's not a scalar field
```

The corrected function addresses the issues in the original `is_scalar_field` function. The changes to the conditions for `field.type_` and `field.schema` should now accurately determine whether a field is a scalar field or not based on the test cases provided.
