Potential error location: The function `is_scalar_field` is supposed to check whether a given field is a scalar field by looking at its shape, type, and schema. The bug seems to occur in the condition `and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)`.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug might be occurring because the function is incorrectly checking if the field's schema is an instance of `params.Body`. This check is not relevant for determining if the field is a scalar field.

Approach for fixing the bug: 
- Remove the condition `and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)` as it is not relevant for determining if the field is a scalar field.
- Add a new condition to check if the field's schema is an instance of `Schema` with a `Query` type, based on the expected result for the test cases.

```python
def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
        and isinstance(field.schema, params.Query)
    )
```
