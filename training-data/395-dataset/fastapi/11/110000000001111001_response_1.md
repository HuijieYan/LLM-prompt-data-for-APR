The buggy function `is_scalar_field` is trying to check if a given field is a scalar field by verifying certain conditions. 

However, it seems to have a bug in the logic leading to incorrect results. The bug lies in the conditions being checked within the function. The conditions are not accurately checking for scalar fields. 

To fix this bug, the function should check if the field shape is SINGLETON, the type is not a subclass of BaseModel, the type is not a sequence type or a dictionary, and the schema is not an instance of `params.Body`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not isinstance(field.type_, (list, tuple, set, dict))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
    )
```

With these corrections, the function should now accurately determine if the input field is a scalar field or not.
