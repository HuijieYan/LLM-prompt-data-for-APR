It seems that the issue is related to the handling of Union types as request parameters in the FastAPI framework. The error message indicates that an empty ValidationRequestError is being raised when parameters are of Union type, even if the parameters sent are valid.

The potential error location is within the function `is_scalar_field` defined in `/Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/fastapi_11/fastapi/dependencies/utils.py`. The function seems to be related to the validation and parsing of request parameters, which might be relevant to the issue described in the GitHub bug report.

The occurrence of the bug could be due to the handling of Union types in the function, specifically the way validation is being performed for Union types. FastAPI might not handle Union types as request parameters correctly, leading to the empty ValidationRequestError being raised.

One possible approach for fixing the bug could be to enhance the handling of Union types within the function `is_scalar_field` to ensure that request parameters of Union type are properly validated and parsed. This may involve modifying the validation logic for Union types and ensuring that the correct validation error messages are generated when needed.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_scalar_field` function:

```python
from typing import Any, Dict, Type
from pydantic import Field, BaseModel

def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    scalar_types = (int, float, str, bool)
    return (
        field.shape == Field.SHAPE_SINGLETON
        and (
            isinstance(field.type_, scalar_types)
            or issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
            or issubclass(field.type_, dict)
        )
        and field.schema is None
    )
```

In this corrected code, we are checking if the field's type is a scalar type (int, float, str, bool), or if it's a subclass of BaseModel or dict. Additionally, we ensure that the field's schema is None, which indicates it's a simple field without any special conditions.

This correction aims to handle Union types and their subtypes correctly, and it also takes into account the possibility that the field is a basic scalar type or a subclass of BaseModel or dict.
