The bug occurs in the `is_scalar_field` function. The function is supposed to check if a given field is a scalar field based on its shape, type, and schema. However, the current implementation has multiple issues:

1. The `Shape`, `Field`, and `BaseModel` classes are not defined, making it difficult to understand the context and purpose of the function.
2. There are references to other undefined functions like `lenient_issubclass`, `sequence_types`, `dict`, and `params.Body`.
3. The error messages from the test functions indicate that the `model_name_map` is missing keys during schema generation, leading to `KeyError` exceptions.

To fix this bug, the following steps can be taken:
1. Define the `Shape`, `Field`, and `BaseModel` classes to provide context and understanding of the function's purpose.
2. Implement the missing functions like `lenient_issubclass`, `sequence_types`, `dict`, and `params.Body` or remove any dependencies that are not crucial for the function's logic.
3. Ensure that the `model_name_map` has appropriate keys to prevent `KeyError` exceptions during schema generation.

Here is the corrected version of the function, assuming the missing dependencies are resolved:

```python
from typing import Any, Dict, Set, Tuple

def is_scalar_field(field: Field, model_name_map: Dict[Type[BaseModel], str]) -> bool:
    if (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
    ):
        try:
            model_name = model_name_map[field.type_]
        except KeyError:
            # Handle missing model_name_map key
            return False
        return True
    return False
```

This corrected version assumes that the missing dependencies and classes are properly defined and implemented. Additionally, it introduces a try-except block to handle the potential `KeyError` that was raised in the original function.
