The bug seems to be related to how FastAPI handles Union types in request parameters. The specific issue is that when parameters (body payload) are defined as Union, the code runs fine until executing the method, and the empty ValidationRequestError is thrown when the route method is called, even if all the parameters sent are valid.

Upon analysis, the potential error location within the problematic function seems to be related to how the function `is_scalar_field` checks for the type of the field. The bug might be occurring because the `is_scalar_field` function does not handle Union types properly, leading to the empty ValidationRequestError.

To fix the bug, the `is_scalar_field` function should be updated to correctly handle Union types in the field. This can be achieved by modifying the function to properly handle Union types and ensure that the type resolution and parsing against the types inside the Union are performed accurately.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_scalar_field` function:

```python
from typing import Union

def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not (isinstance(field.type_, Union) and all(lenient_issubclass(t, BaseModel) for t in field.type_.__args__))
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
    )
```

In the corrected code, we handle the Union type by checking if the field's type is an instance of Union, and then ensuring that all the types inside the Union are not subclasses of BaseModel. This allows the function to correctly handle Union types in the field and address the issue related to the empty ValidationRequestError when using Union types in request parameters.
