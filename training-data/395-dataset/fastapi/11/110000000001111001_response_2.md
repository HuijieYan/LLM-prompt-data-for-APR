Potential error location: The condition `field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON` seems to be causing issues as it is being checked against the `Shape` enum.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The condition `field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON` is comparing an enum value to the `shape` attribute of the `field`, which is likely causing the function to not behave as expected.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the actual value of the `field.shape` attribute instead of comparing it with an enum value directly.
2. Validate the data type of `field.type_` to ensure it is a subclass of `BaseModel`.
3. Check if `field.type_` is a subclass of sequence types or a dictionary.
4. Ensure that `field.schema` is not an instance of `params.Body`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape.value == 1  # Assuming 1 represents the Shape.SINGLETON value
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, (list, dict))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
    )
```
In the corrected code:
- The condition for `field.shape` now checks the `value` attribute to compare it with the enum value.
- The `sequence_types` has been replaced with `(list, dict)` to check if `field.type_` is a subclass of a list or a dictionary.
- The condition for `field.schema` remains the same to ensure it is not an instance of `params.Body`.
