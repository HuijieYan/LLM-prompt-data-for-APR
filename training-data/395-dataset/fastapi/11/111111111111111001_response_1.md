The error seems to be caused by the incorrect handling of the `model_name_map` dictionary inside the `field_singleton_schema` function. The `model_name_map` dictionary is being used to retrieve the name of a model, and at the moment of the error, it cannot find the corresponding model name for the given model class.

The reason behind the bug is that the `model_name_map` does not contain the required model class as a key when the problematic function tries to retrieve the model name.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the `model_name_map` dictionary contains all the necessary model classes as keys. This can be done by populating the `model_name_map` appropriately with the required model classes and their corresponding names before it is used in the `field_singleton_schema` function.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
    )
```

Since the error seems to be related to the `model_name_map`, additional context about its usage might be necessary for a more accurate correction.
