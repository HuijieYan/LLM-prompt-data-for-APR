The problem seems to be related to the function `is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool`. It's likely that the function is not correctly identifying a field when it's defined as a `Union`. This could be due to not properly handling fields with a `Union` type.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle fields with a `Union` type and ensure that it can correctly identify the fields within the `Union` type.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON  # Verify if it is a singleton
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)  # Ensure it's not a BaseModel
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))  # Ensure it's not a sequence or dict
        and not any(isinstance(sub_field.schema, params.Body) for sub_field in getattr(field.type_, "__args__", ()))  # Ensure sub-fields are not of type Body
    )
```
In the corrected code, we are properly handling the `field.type_` when it's a `Union` by using `getattr(field.type_, "__args__", ())` to access the sub-types within the `Union`. Then, we loop through these sub-types and ensure that none of them are of type `Body`.

This should address the issue where the validation error is occurring when the request parameters are of `Union` type.

Please note that this is a hypothetical fix based on the information provided and the nature of the bug. Further testing and integration into the actual codebase would be necessary to confirm its effectiveness.
