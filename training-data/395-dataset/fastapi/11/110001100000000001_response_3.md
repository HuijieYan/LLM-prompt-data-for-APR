Potential Error Location:
The potential error lies in the condition `and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)` as `lenient_issubclass` is not defined in the provided code snippet.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The use of `lenient_issubclass` without its definition is causing the bug in the function.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Define the `lenient_issubclass` function if it is a custom function used for checking subclass relationships.
2. Use the built-in `issubclass` function instead of `lenient_issubclass` for checking subclass relationships.

Corrected Code:
Assuming that `lenient_issubclass` is a custom function, the fixed code might look like this:

```python
def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
    )
```

If `lenient_issubclass` is not a custom function, and assuming it is a typo, the corrected code using `issubclass` would be:

```python
def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
    )
```
