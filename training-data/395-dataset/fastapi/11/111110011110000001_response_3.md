The error message from the test functions suggests that there is an issue with the validation of the request body in FastAPI. The error is occurring when trying to get the schema for a Pydantic field, and it seems to be related to the mismatch between the expected and actual model received.

The bug is likely occurring in the `field_singleton_schema` function within the `pydantic/schema.py` file. The error seems to be due to a missing model in the `model_name_map` dictionary, resulting in a `KeyError`.

To fix this bug, the correct model name should be used in the `model_name_map` dictionary. The model name should match the name of the model being used in the test functions.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the fixed version of the function
def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
    )
```
