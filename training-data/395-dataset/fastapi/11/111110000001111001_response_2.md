Potential Error:
The buggy function `is_scalar_field` is checking if the field shape is a singleton, if the field type is not a subclass of `BaseModel`, if the field type is not a subclass of any sequence types or `dict`, and if the field schema is not an instance of `params.Body`. However, the condition for checking the field type as a subclass of `BaseModel` is not correct, and the condition is also missing for checking the `field.sub_fields`.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because the condition for checking the field type as a subclass of `BaseModel` is not implemented correctly. Additionally, the function does not check the `field.sub_fields`.

Approach to Fix the Bug:
1. Use the `issubclass` function to check if the `field.type_` is a subclass of `BaseModel`.
2. Add a condition to check if any of the `field.sub_fields` is not a scalar field.

```python
def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not any(
            isinstance(sub_field, (list, dict, BaseModel)) for sub_field in field.sub_fields
        )
        and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
    )
```
