Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the problematic function is the condition `and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)`. This condition checks if the `field.schema` is an instance of `params.Body`, but the expected result for the test cases indicates that it should be an instance of `Query` instead of `params.Body`.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the condition is checking for the wrong instance type (`params.Body` instead of `Query`), leading to incorrect evaluation for the test cases.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the condition to check for the correct instance type, which is `Query` instead of `params.Body`.
2. Ensure that the condition aligns with the expected behavior based on the test cases provided.

Corrected Code:
```python
from pydantic import Query

def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, Query)
    )
```
