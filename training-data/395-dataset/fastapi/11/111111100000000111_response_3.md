The bug is likely in the `is_scalar_field` function in the provided code. It seems that this function is used to determine if a field is a scalar field, but the current implementation does not seem to handle Union types correctly, resulting in the empty validation error when request parameters are of Union type.

The bug is likely occurring because the `is_scalar_field` function does not properly handle Union types and their validation.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `is_scalar_field` function to properly handle Union types to avoid the empty validation error.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_scalar_field` function:

```python
from typing import Union

def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
        and not isinstance(field.type_, Union)  # Updated to handle Union types
    )
```

We added the condition `not isinstance(field.type_, Union)` to the return statement, so now the `is_scalar_field` function will correctly handle Union types and should no longer cause the empty validation error when request parameters are of Union type.
