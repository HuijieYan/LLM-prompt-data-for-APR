The bug occurs in the `is_scalar_field` function. This function is responsible for checking if a field is a scalar field, but it fails to properly handle the case where the field is a union of different types.

In the provided test cases, the `field.type_` is a Union type, which means it can be one of multiple types. The function should be updated to handle this scenario and correctly identify Union types as scalar fields.

To fix the bug, the `is_scalar_field` function should be updated to properly handle Union types. Here's the corrected function:

```python
def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, (list, dict))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
        and not isinstance(field.type_, typing._SpecialForm)
    )
```

In this updated function, we check if the `field.type_` is a subclass of `typing._SpecialForm`. This is because `Union` type is an instance of `_GenericAlias`, which is a subclass of `_SpecialForm`. This check will correctly identify Union types as non-scalar fields.

With this update, the `is_scalar_field` function should now correctly handle Union types and avoid empty validation errors when request parameters are of Union type.
