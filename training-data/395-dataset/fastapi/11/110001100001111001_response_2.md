Potential errors in the provided function:
1. The condition `field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON` is correct and doesn't need fixing.
2. The condition `not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)` is also correct and doesn't need fixing.
3. The condition `not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))` may be causing an issue as it checks for the presence of the field type in `sequence_types` or `dict`. It should be updated to handle Union types correctly.
4. The condition `not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)` is also correct and doesn't need fixing.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not handle Union types correctly, resulting in erroneous output.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition related to Union types to appropriately handle them.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not (getattr(field.type_, "__origin__", None) is Union)
        and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
    )
```
