The bug is occurring in the `is_scalar_field` function. The function is designed to check if a given field is a scalar field based on certain conditions. The bug is likely in the condition checking logic of the function, as it is throwing errors when running the provided test cases.

The error messages suggest that the `is_scalar_field` function is not properly handling the union types and validating the fields which have union types specified in their type annotations.

Here are the potential approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Adjust the condition checking to properly handle fields with union types.
2. Make sure that the function handles all the possible scenarios for field types and shape correctly.

Below is the corrected code for the `is_scalar_field` function:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, Schema
from pydantic.types import Any
from pydantic.schema import TypeVar_

sequence_types = (list, set, tuple)

def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    supported_types = (int, float, str, bool)  # Add any other supported scalar types here
    return (
        field.type_ in supported_types
        or field.type_ is Any
        or field.shape == Schema.SINGLETON
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, Schema)
    )
```

In this corrected code, the `is_scalar_field` function now includes additional checks for the supported scalar field types. It also includes a check for `Any` type, which corresponds to union type handling. Additionally, it checks for the shape using the correct attribute `field.shape`.
