The error messages provided are from the test functions calling the fastAPI services. They indicate that there is an error in the request body parsing and validation. The error occurs in the `field_singleton_schema` function of the `pydantic` library. 

Upon examining the provided function `is_scalar_field`, it seems to be trying to validate if a given field is a scalar field or not, based on its type, shape, and schema. However, due to the complexity of the code and requirements, there might be some issues that need to be addressed. The KeyError in the error message indicates that the function `field_singleton_schema` is trying to access a dictionary key (`model_name_map[field_type]`) which does not exist in the dictionary.

To fix the issue, we need to review the `field_singleton_schema` function and verify if the dictionary `model_name_map` contains the required key. It might be possible that the key is missing or not being populated correctly, leading to the KeyError.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_scalar_field` function:

```python
from pydantic.main import Field, ModelNameMap

def is_scalar_field(field: Field, model_name_map: ModelNameMap) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
        and model_name_map.get(field.type_)
    )
```

In this correction, the `model_name_map` dictionary is passed as a parameter to the function. Additionally, the `model_name_map` is checked using `model_name_map.get(field.type_)` to ensure that the key exists before attempting to access it. This will prevent the KeyError from occurring.
