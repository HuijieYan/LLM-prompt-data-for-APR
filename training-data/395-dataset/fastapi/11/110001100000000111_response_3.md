The bug is likely occurring due to the current implementation of the `is_scalar_field` function. This function is used to determine if a field is a scalar field, and it appears to be failing to correctly handle Union types.

The bug may be occurring because the function is not properly handling Union types. It is possible that the function is not correctly identifying Union types as scalar fields, leading to validation errors when handling Union types as request parameters.

To fix the bug, the `is_scalar_field` function should be updated to handle Union types properly, ensuring that it can correctly identify Union types as scalar fields and handle them appropriately.

Here is the corrected code for the `is_scalar_field` function:

```python
def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
        and not getattr(field.type_, "__origin__", None) == Union
    )
```

In the corrected code, an additional check has been added to ensure that the field type is not a Union type. This should help in correctly identifying Union types as non-scalar fields and handling them appropriately in the validation process.
