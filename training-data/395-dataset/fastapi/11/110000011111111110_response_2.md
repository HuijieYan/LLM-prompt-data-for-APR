The issue in the provided function is that it is not correctly checking if a field is a scalar field. I will fix the function and provide the corrected function below:

```python
# Corrected function
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, sequence

def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == 'Singleton'
        and not issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not issubclass(field.type_, (sequence, dict))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
    )
```

I have updated the function `is_scalar_field` to use string comparison for `field.shape`, use `issubclass` to check if `field.type_` is a subclass of `BaseModel` and `sequence`, and also use `instance` to check if `field.schema` is an instance of `params.Body`.

These changes should address the issues related to the validation error and ensure that the function correctly checks if a field is a scalar field.

I hope the corrected function helps to resolve the issues mentioned in the GitHub issue.
