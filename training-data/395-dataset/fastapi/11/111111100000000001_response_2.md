Potential error location: 
The potential error in the provided function is the comparison of the 'field.shape' attribute with 'Shape.SINGLETON' as 'Shape' is not defined in the code snippet provided.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The error occurs because the 'Shape' class is not defined in the code snippet, yet it is used for comparison with the 'field.shape' attribute. This will result in a NameError as 'Shape' is not a defined class in the given code.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define the 'Shape' class in the code snippet with appropriate attributes and methods to match the comparison being made in the function.
2. If 'Shape' is intended to be an existing class from an external module, then import the 'Shape' class from the appropriate module to use it in the comparison.
3. If the intention is to compare 'field.shape' with a predefined value, then use a standard Python object or value for comparison instead of 'Shape'.

Corrected code:
```python
def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.type_ == str
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
    )
```

In the corrected code, I have replaced the comparison of 'field.shape' with 'Shape.SINGLETON' with the comparison of 'field.type_' with the standard Python object 'str' to determine if the field is a scalar field or not.
