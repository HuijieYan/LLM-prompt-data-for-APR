The buggy function `is_scalar_field` makes use of several methods and classes like `lenient_issubclass`, `sequence_types`, `BaseModel`, and `params.Body` without their definitions provided. The function appears to be part of a bigger framework related to API and web development, as it references `Method`, `Shape`, `BaseModel`, `sequence_types`, and `params.Body`, which are likely custom classes and attributes related to web framework implementations.

The error messages from the test functions are quite consistent, pointing towards a `KeyError` which generally occurs when a dictionary key is not found. This suggests that a dictionary `model_name_map` is missing the appropriate entry for a specific type.

The bug is likely occurring when the line `model_name = model_name_map[field_type]` within the `field_singleton_schema` function is trying to retrieve the name for a specific type from the `model_name_map` dictionary. If the `field_type` is not found in the `model_name_map` dictionary, it raises a `KeyError`.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to ensure that `model_name_map` contains all the necessary entries for the types being accessed within the `field_singleton_schema` function.

It is important to consider that the classes and functions used within the `is_scalar_field` function are part of a larger framework, and accessing or modifying those elements should be done in line with the overall architecture and guidelines of the framework.

The corrected version of the `is_scalar_field` function:

```python
def is_scalar_field(field: Field, model_name_map: Dict[Type['BaseModel'], str]) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
        and field.type_ in model_name_map
    )
```

In the corrected function, the `model_name_map` is explicitly provided as a parameter to ensure that it contains the required entries for the types being accessed within the function. Additionally, the function signature includes the `model_name_map` dictionary as a required parameter to properly handle the type-to-name mapping.
