The function provided has some issues that need to be fixed. Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, Shape, params
from typing import Union, List, Dict, Tuple, Any, Set, TypeVar, Type

def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    sequence_types = (List, Tuple)
    
    if (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not isinstance(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not isinstance(field.type_, (List, Tuple, dict))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
    ):
        return True
    else:
        return False
```

I've added the necessary imports, corrected the condition checks, and modified the list of sequence types to resolve the issues in the original function.

Please note that I've made assumptions about the necessary imports based on the current code and the issues observed. If there are any additional imports required, please add them accordingly.
