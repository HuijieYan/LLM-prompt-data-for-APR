Potential error location: The error could be in the condition `lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)` and `lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))` as these are not defined in the given code snippet.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `lenient_issubclass` function is not defined in the given code, which is causing the bug.

Approach for fixing the bug: Define the `lenient_issubclass` function or replace it with a suitable alternative. Additionally, the `Shape` and `Field` classes are not defined here, so they need to be imported or defined as well.

Corrected code:

```python
from typing import Any, Type, Union
from fastapi.params import Body

def is_scalar_field(field: Any) -> bool:
    from pydantic import BaseModel
    from typing import Sequence, Dict

    sequence_types = (Sequence, list, tuple)
    
    return (
        hasattr(field, "shape") and field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not isinstance(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not isinstance(field.type_, sequence_types + (Dict,))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, Body)
    )
```
