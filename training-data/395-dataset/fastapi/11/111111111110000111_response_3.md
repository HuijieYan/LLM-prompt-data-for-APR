The provided code has a bug in the is_scalar_field function. The function is intended to check if a given field is a scalar value. It is used by FastAPI to generate OpenAPI schemas and perform input validation.

The function seems to have issues with identifying the type of the field. The code may not be handling Union types correctly, leading to validation errors when using Union types in the request parameters.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to properly handle Union types and validate the fields based on the Union types provided.

Here is the corrected code for the is_scalar_field function:

```python
from typing import List, Set, Dict, Type

from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, Schema, Any, TypeVar, Type, Union, Optional, Sequence, Dict
import pydantic
from enum import Enum
from fastapi import params

sequence_types = (List, Set, Dict)


class Shape(Enum):
    SINGLETON = "singleton"


def is_callable_type(field_type):
    return True  # implementation specific to the actual use case


def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
            field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
            and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
            and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
            and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
            and not isinstance(field.type_, Union)  # check for Union type and handle accordingly
    )
```

In the updated code, we check if the type of the field is a Union and handle it appropriately to ensure proper validation. This should resolve the issue related to the Union types causing empty validation errors.

By making this change, the is_scalar_field function should be able to handle Union types properly and perform validation as expected, resolving the reported bug.
