The error seems to be related to the way Union types are handled in the function. The function `is_scalar_field` takes a parameter `field` which has a type of `Field`. The error message indicates that there is a KeyError being raised related to the model name lookup with field type `OtherItem` and `ExtendedItem`.

The bug occurs because the function is not handling Union types correctly. When a request is made with a Union type as the request body, the function is not able to handle it properly, leading to a Keyerror and subsequent errors during the request processing.

To fix the bug, the function `is_scalar_field` should be modified to correctly handle Union types. This can be done using isinstance(field.type_, TypeVar) and other isinstance checks to correctly identify the type of the field. Additionally, the function should handle the Union type to ensure that it properly checks for the required fields in the Union.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from typing import Union

def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    # Check if the field type is a Union
    if getattr(field.type_, "__origin__", None) == Union:
        for type_ in field.type_.__args__:
            # Check if any type in the Union is BaseModel or sequence_types or dict
            if (
                lenient_issubclass(type_, BaseModel)
                or lenient_issubclass(type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
            ):
                return False
        # Check for schema type
        if isinstance(field.schema, params.Body):
            return False
        return field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
    else:
        return (
            field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
            and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
            and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
            and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
        )
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly handle Union types and validate the request parameters without raising KeyErrors.
