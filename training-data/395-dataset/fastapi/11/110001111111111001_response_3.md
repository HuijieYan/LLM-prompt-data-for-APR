The error occurs because the `is_scalar_field` function is not properly handling the `shape` and `type_` attributes of the `Field` class. The function is designed to check if a field is a scalar field based on certain conditions, however, the current implementation is not accurate.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `is_scalar_field` function to handle the `shape`, `type_`, and `schema` attributes of the `Field` class correctly by checking their values and types. Additionally, the condition for `field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON` should be revisited to ensure it's implemented correctly for the given input parameters.

The corrected code for the `is_scalar_field` function is as follows:

```python
from typing import Union, Type, Tuple, Dict, Any, Set

# Assuming import statements for Field and BaseModel
# (from pydantic import Field, BaseModel) are present

def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
        and (
            field.type_ in (int, float, str, bool)
            or lenient_issubclass(field.type_, (int, float, str, bool))
        )
    )
```

In the corrected code:
- We compare the `field.shape` directly with `Shape.SINGLETON` using an equality check.
- The `field.schema` is checked to not be an instance of `params.Body`.
- The `field.type_` is checked to be one of the scalar types: `int`, `float`, `str`, or `bool`, or a subclass of one of these types.

The corrected code should address the issues in the original implementation and improve the handling of the conditions for determining scalar fields.
