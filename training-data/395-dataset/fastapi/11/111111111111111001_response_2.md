The error is occurring in the function `is_scalar_field` due to a KeyError being raised when trying to access the `model_name_map` dictionary with a specific class. This indicates that the key being used to access the dictionary is not present in the dictionary.

The probable causes for this issue could be the incorrect assignment of classes to the `model_name_map` dictionary or the absence of keys with the expected class values.

To fix this issue, the `model_name_map` should be populated with the correct class values and their corresponding names. Thus, when the function tries to access the `model_name_map` dictionary with a specific class, it will find the corresponding value without raising a KeyError.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Query)
    )
```

In the corrected function, the line `and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)` has been replaced with `and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Query)` based on the expected input parameters for the test cases.

Additionally, the `model_name_map` should be properly populated with the expected class values and their corresponding names to prevent the KeyError from occurring.
