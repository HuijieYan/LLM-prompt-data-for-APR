The buggy function `is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool` seems to be encountering a Key Error due to the field type when trying to retrieve a model name. The function is trying to retrieve a model name from a dictionary `model_name_map` based on the field type. However, it is encountering a Key Error because the field type is not present in the `model_name_map`.

The error occurs when the function attempts to retrieve the model name using `model_name = model_name_map[field_type]`. This happens because the `field_type` is not found as a key in the `model_name_map`.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `field_type` is present in the `model_name_map` before attempting to retrieve the model name. If the `field_type` is not present, alternative handling should be implemented.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
def is_scalar_field(field: Field, model_name_map: Dict[Type['BaseModel'], str]) -> bool:
    if field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel) and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,)) and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body):
        if field.type_ in model_name_map:
            model_name = model_name_map[field.type_]
            return True
        else:
            # Handle case when model name is not available in the map
            return False
    else:
        return False
```

Additionally, the `model_name_map` dictionary should be provided as an argument to the function to ensure that the appropriate model names are available for retrieval within the function.
