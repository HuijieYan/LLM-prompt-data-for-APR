The potential error location within the problematic function is the check for whether the field type is a subclass of `BaseModel`.

The bug occurs because the `Union` type is not being handled correctly in the `is_scalar_field` function. The function is checking if the field type is a subclass of `BaseModel`, which may not be true for fields defined as `Union`. This is leading to the empty ValidationRequestError being thrown when a request with a Union type payload is received.

To fix the bug, the `is_scalar_field` function should be updated to handle `Union` types properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_scalar_field` function:

```python
from typing import Union

def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not isinstance(field.type_, Union)
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
    )
```

In the corrected code, we have added a check to exclude `Union` type from being considered as a scalar field, which should address the bug described in the GitHub issue.
