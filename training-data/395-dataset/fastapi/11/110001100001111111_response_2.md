Based on the provided information, it appears that the issue is occurring in the `is_scalar_field` function. The function is intended to check if a field is a scalar field based on certain conditions, but it seems to be incorrectly classifying fields as scalar when they are actually of a Union type.

The bug occurs because the `is_scalar_field` function does not account for fields with Union types, and it does not properly handle the validation of Union types in the request parameters.

To fix the bug, the `is_scalar_field` function should be updated to correctly handle Union types and ensure that the validation of Union types in the request parameters is performed accurately.

Here is the corrected code for the `is_scalar_field` function:

```python
from typing import Union

def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, (params.Body, Union))
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `isinstance` check now includes `Union` in addition to `params.Body`, allowing the function to properly handle Union types in the request parameters. This should resolve the issue of empty validation errors when request parameters are of Union type.

This fix should address the issue described in the GitHub bug report and ensure that the Union types in the request parameters are resolved and parsed against the types inside the Union.
