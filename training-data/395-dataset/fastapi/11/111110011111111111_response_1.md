The buggy function `is_scalar_field` is designed to determine whether a given `Field` is a scalar field based on certain conditions. The function seems to be failing when checking the `field.type_` and `field.schema`.

The error messages from the test functions indicate that the error is related to mapping the `field_type` and `field.schema` to certain values, resulting in `KeyError` exceptions.

The potential reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function `is_scalar_field` is not handling all the possible variations of `field.type_` and `field.schema` correctly, which leads to the `KeyError` exceptions.

To fix the bug, the function `is_scalar_field` needs to be updated to handle these variations correctly and ensure that it can identify scalar fields accurately based on the given conditions and input parameters.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_scalar_field` function:

```python
def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_.__origin__, (list, dict))  # Handle generic types
        and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
    )
```

In the corrected code, `field.type_.__origin__` is used to handle generic types. Additionally, any other necessary checks can be added based on the specific requirements and supported variations of `field.type_` and `field.schema`.
