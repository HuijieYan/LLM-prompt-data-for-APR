The bug is likely occurring in the `is_scalar_field` function, which is being used to validate the field types. The bug is likely causing the function to incorrectly identify the field types in the Union type used in the request.

The reason behind this bug could be that the `is_scalar_field` function is not handling Union types correctly, hence leading to the empty ValidationRequestError.

To fix this bug, the `is_scalar_field` function needs to be modified to handle Union types appropriately when validating the field types.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_scalar_field` function:

```python
def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, (list, dict))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the check for Union types has been removed and replaced with a check for the individual types inside the Union. This should allow the function to properly handle Union types when validating the field types.
