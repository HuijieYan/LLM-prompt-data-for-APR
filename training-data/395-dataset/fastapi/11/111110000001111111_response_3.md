The bug in the `is_scalar_field` function seems to be related to the condition that checks if the `field.schema` is an instance of `params.Body`. Based on the expected input and output, it seems like the `field.schema` should be an instance of `Query` instead of `params.Body` in order for the function to return `True`. 

This may be causing the function to return `False` even when the input parameters are of the expected types.

The `field.schema` should be checked for an instance of `Query` instead of `params.Body`. 

Here's the corrected code for the `is_scalar_field` function:

```python
# corrected function
def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, Query)
    )
```
