The error originates from the `field_singleton_schema` function within the `pydantic/schema.py` file. The error is caused by a `KeyError` when the function tries to access a key in the `model_name_map` dictionary. This means that the `model_name_map` is missing the required class key, causing the KeyError.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `model_name_map` dictionary includes all the required class keys.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
    )
```
