Potential error location: The potential error location is in the condition checks within the is_scalar_field function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: 
- The condition checks are not properly evaluating the field's properties to determine if it is a scalar field.
- The use of lenient_issubclass and sequence_types is unclear and could be causing the issue.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Use clearer condition checks to determine if the field is a scalar field.
- Update the condition checks to directly compare the field's properties instead of using lenient_issubclass and sequence_types.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected function
def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and field.type_ not in [BaseModel, list, dict]
        and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
    )
```
