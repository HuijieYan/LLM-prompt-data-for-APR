The bug seems to be within the function `is_scalar_field` inside the `utils.py` file. The error messages indicate that the bug may be related to accessing a `model_name_map` dictionary with incorrect keys.

The probable reason for the bug is that the `model_name_map` dictionary is being accessed with incorrect keys or missing keys, leading to a `KeyError`. This could be due to incorrect type mapping or missing model classes in the `model_name_map`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the correct keys are used to access the `model_name_map` dictionary. Additionally, we may need to verify that the model classes are correctly mapped in the `model_name_map` to avoid missing keys.

Below is the corrected `is_scalar_field` function:

```python
def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
    )
```

Please ensure that the `model_name_map` dictionary is correctly populated with the appropriate model classes as keys and their names as values. This should resolve the `KeyError` caused by incorrect or missing keys in the `model_name_map` dictionary.
