The error occurs due to missing reference to a particular BaseModel subclass in the model_name_map dictionary.

To fix this bug, we need to make sure that the model_name_map contains an entry for each BaseModel subclass being used.

Corrected function:

```python
def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
        and not isinstance(getattr(field, 'schema', None), params.Body)
    )
```

In the corrected function, the code is updated to also check whether the `schema` attribute is present on the field and obtain its value using `getattr`. This helps to avoid the KeyError issue caused by the missing reference in the `model_name_map` dictionary.

Additionally, it appears that the condition `not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)` might be incorrect. It should likely be `isinstance(field.type_, BaseModel)` if the goal is to check if `field.type_` is an instance of the `BaseModel` class.

For a more comprehensive and accurate fix, further context and understanding of the related classes and structures is necessary.
