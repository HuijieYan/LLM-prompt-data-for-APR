The bug is likely occurring in the is_scalar_field function, which is used for validation. The bug could be related to how the function handles Union types, as the issue description indicates that a ValidationRequestError is thrown when working with Union types as parameters.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line that checks the type of the field, specifically the Union type.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the is_scalar_field function does not handle Union types properly, which leads to the empty ValidationRequestError being thrown.

To fix the bug, the is_scalar_field function needs to be updated to properly handle Union types. This may involve checking if the field type is a Union and then applying the validation logic to each type within the Union.

Here's the corrected code for the is_scalar_field function:

```python
from typing import Union

def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    if hasattr(field.type_, "__origin__") and field.type_.__origin__ == Union:
        # If the field type is a Union, validate each type within the Union individually
        return all(
            is_scalar_field(Field(type=inner_type, shape=field.shape, schema=field.schema))
            for inner_type in field.type_.__args__
        )
    else:
        return (
            field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
            and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
            and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
            and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
        )
```

In the corrected code, if the field type is a Union, we validate each type within the Union individually by recursively calling the is_scalar_field function for each inner type. This ensures that the validation logic is properly applied to Union types.
