The issue seems to be with the `is_scalar_field` function that is not correctly handling fields of Union type. The bug occurs because the function does not correctly identify Union types within the field and does not handle them as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `is_scalar_field` function to correctly handle Union types within the field.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not (isinstance(field.type_, _GenericAlias) and field.type_.__origin__ == Union)
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
    )
```

In the corrected function, we check if the field type is a `_GenericAlias` and its origin is a `Union`. If it is, we handle it accordingly.

This should address the issue with empty validation errors when request parameters are of Union type.
