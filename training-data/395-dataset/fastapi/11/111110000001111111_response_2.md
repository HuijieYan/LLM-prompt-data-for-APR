The bug is likely occurring at the `is_scalar_field` function, where it checks if the field is a scalar field. The function is currently incorrectly checking if the `field.type_` is a subclass of `BaseModel` and if it's a subclass of sequence types or a dictionary. However, in the context of Union types, the `field.type_` may not directly be a subclass of `BaseModel` or a sequence type, causing the function to return `True` when it shouldn't.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `is_scalar_field` function to handle Union types and their validation correctly.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    # Check if the field is a single value (Shape.SINGLETON)
    if field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON:
        # If the type is a Union, check each type separately
        if hasattr(field.type_, "__origin__") and field.type_.__origin__ == Union:
            for sub_type in field.type_.__args__:
                # If any sub-type is a BaseModel or a sequence type or a dictionary, return False
                if (
                    lenient_issubclass(sub_type, BaseModel)
                    or lenient_issubclass(sub_type, sequence_types + (dict,))
                ):
                    return False
        else:
            # If the type is not a Union, check if it's a BaseModel or sequence type or a dictionary
            if (
                not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
                and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
            ):
                return not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
    return False
```

This corrected function now properly handles Union types by iterating through each type within the Union and checking if it's a BaseModel, a sequence type, or a dictionary. This ensures that the validation for Union types is accurate and fixes the bug related to empty ValidationRequestError.
