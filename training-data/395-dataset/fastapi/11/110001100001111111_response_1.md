The issue seems to be caused by the incorrect validation of fields in the `is_scalar_field` function. The function is not properly checking for Union types and is also failing to validate the `Body` parameter.

To fix this issue, the `is_scalar_field` function should be updated to properly handle Union types and validate the request parameters against the types inside Union.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
        and not (
            isinstance(field.sub_fields[0].type_, Union)
            and not all(
                isinstance(sub_field.schema, (Query, Path, Header, Cookie))
                for sub_field in field.sub_fields
            )
        )
    )
```
