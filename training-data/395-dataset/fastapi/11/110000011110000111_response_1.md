The bug seems to be in the `is_scalar_field` function, which is used for validating field types in FastAPI. The error message also shows issues with validation errors when request parameters are of Union type.

The reason behind the bug could be that the `is_scalar_field` function is not properly handling the Union type for request parameters, leading to validation errors.

To fix the bug, the `is_scalar_field` function needs to handle Union types appropriately. It should check for each type within the Union and validate the field against all the types within the Union.

Below is the corrected function:

```python
def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    if isinstance(field.type_, Union):
        return all(is_scalar_field(Field(type_=t, shape=field.shape, schema=field.schema)) for t in field.type_.__args__)
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
    )
```

In the corrected function, we first check if the type of the field is a Union. If so, we iterate through each type within the Union and validate the field against all the types using a list comprehension. If all the types within the Union pass the validation, the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

This should address the issue of validation errors when request parameters are of Union type.
