The bug is occurring in the `is_scalar_field` function, which is used to determine if a field is a scalar field. The function is currently checking the `field.shape`, `field.type_`, `field.type_`, and `field.schema` attributes to determine if the field is scalar.

The bug is likely caused by the function not correctly handling Union types. When a field is a Union type (as in the provided GitHub issue), the function is not correctly handling it and potentially treating it as a non-scalar field, leading to the empty validation error.

To fix this bug, the `is_scalar_field` function needs to be updated to handle Union types properly and account for the specific behavior of Union types in FastAPI.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    from pydantic.fields import ModelField

    if isinstance(field, ModelField) and hasattr(field, "sub_fields"):
        return all(is_scalar_field(sub_field) for sub_field in field.sub_fields)
    
    return (
        field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
        and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
        and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
    )
```

This updated function handles Union types by recursively checking if all the sub-fields within the Union are scalar fields. This approach ensures that Union types are correctly handled and that the function behaves as expected for Union fields.
