The buggy function `is_scalar_field` seems to be related to issues in handling Union types in FastAPI. The error messages from the test functions also point to validation errors when using Union types for request parameters.

The bug appears to be related to the handling of Union types in FastAPI, specifically when receiving requests with Union types as parameters. The code may not handle the union of models properly, resulting in empty validation errors.

To fix the bug, it is important to ensure that the function `is_scalar_field` correctly handles the validation of Union types. This may involve revisiting the way Union types are processed within the function and ensuring that the validation of the parameters is performed accurately.

Here's the corrected code for the `is_scalar_field` function:

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, Field, Schema, ValidationError
from typing import Type, Dict, Any, Set
from pydantic.fields import FieldInfo
from pydantic.schema import UnionModel


def is_scalar_field(field: Field) -> bool:
    if isinstance(field.type_, UnionModel):  # Check if the field type is a Union
        union_types = field.type_.__args__  # Get the individual types in the Union
        for union_type in union_types:
            if issubclass(union_type, BaseModel):  # Check if the type is a BaseModel
                return False  # Return False if any of the types is a BaseModel
        return True  # Return True if none of the types is a BaseModel
    else:
        return (
            field.shape == Shape.SINGLETON
            and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, BaseModel)
            and not lenient_issubclass(field.type_, sequence_types + (dict,))
            and not isinstance(field.schema, params.Body)
        )
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the field type is a Union using `isinstance`. Then we iterate through the individual types in the Union and check if any of them is a `BaseModel`. If any type is a `BaseModel`, we return `False`, indicating that it is not a scalar field. Otherwise, we return `True`, indicating that it is a scalar field.

This corrected approach ensures that Union types are handled appropriately when validating request parameters.

It is important to note that the provided fix assumes the details of the internal implementation of the `Field` class and the handling of Union types in FastAPI. The actual fix may require a more in-depth understanding of the FastAPI framework.
