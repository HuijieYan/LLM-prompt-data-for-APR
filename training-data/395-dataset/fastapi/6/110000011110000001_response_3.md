The error in the provided code is related to the handling of form data with non-typing sequences. When the `test_python_list_param_as_form`, `test_python_set_param_as_form`, and `test_python_tuple_param_as_form` functions are run, they expect the response status code to be 200, but it is actually 422. This indicates that the request body is not being processed correctly, leading to an incorrect response status code.

The potential error location within the `request_body_to_args` function is the part that handles non-typing sequences. It seems that the function is not properly extracting and processing the values from the request body when non-typing sequences are passed.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `request_body_to_args` function is not correctly handling non-typing sequences, leading to incorrect validation and processing of the request body.

To fix the bug, the `request_body_to_args` function needs to be updated to properly handle non-typing sequences in the request body. This can be achieved by specifically checking for non-typing sequences and processing their values accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
from typing import List, Union, Dict, Any, Tuple, Optional
from pydantic.fields import ModelField
from pydantic.error_wrappers import ErrorWrapper
from typing_extensions import FormData

# Corrected function
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias) if field.shape in ("list", "set", "tuple") else received_body.get(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)

            field_info = get_field_info(field)
            if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue

            if field.shape == "list" and isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and isinstance(value, list):
                # Process list values
                value = [await v.read() if isinstance(v, UploadFile) else v for v in value]
            elif field.shape in ("set", "tuple") and isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and isinstance(value, (set, list, tuple)):
                # Process set or tuple values
                value = type(value)([await v.read() if isinstance(v, UploadFile) else v for v in value])

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In the corrected code, non-typing sequences are specifically handled based on their shapes (list, set, tuple), and their values are processed accordingly. This should resolve the issue with processing non-typing sequences in the request body and ensure that the response status code is 200 as expected in the test cases.
