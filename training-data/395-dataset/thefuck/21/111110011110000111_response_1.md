The test case 'test_not_match' is calling the 'match' function with a Command object that has the script 'git' and stderr containing the error message related to 'git stash'. The error message from the test function indicates that the 'list index out of range' error occurs in the 'match' function at line 8.

The error occurs because the 'command.script.split()[1]' is trying to access the second element of the split command script, but if the script is just 'git', there won't be a second element.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the script split has at least two elements before accessing the second element. We also need to update the 'match' function to handle cases where the input script does not contain the expected elements.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# Corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    script = command.script.split()
    return len(script) > 1 and script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

In the corrected function, we first split the command script and then check if the split contains at least two elements before comparing the second element to 'stash'. This approach ensures that we avoid the 'list index out of range' error.

With this correction, the 'match' function should now be able to handle cases where the input script does not contain the expected elements, addressing the bug.
