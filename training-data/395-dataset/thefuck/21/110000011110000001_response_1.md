The error message suggests that the 'IndexError: list index out of range' is occurring in the `command.script.split()[1]` part of the code. This indicates that there is no second element in the list returned by `split()`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `command.script.split()[1]`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `command.script` might not contain any space, which causes the `split()` method to return a list with only one element, and thus accessing index 1 of that list results in an IndexError.

To fix the bug, a check for the length of the split list should be added to ensure that there is at least one element before trying to access index 1.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from thefuck.utils import for_app

@git_support
def match(command):
    try:
        return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    except IndexError:
        return False
```

In the corrected code, a try-except block is added to catch the IndexError that might occur when accessing index 1 of the split list. If an IndexError occurs, False is returned.
