The test case and the error message indicate that the bug occurs in the function `match` in the file `git_fix_stash.py`. The error seems to be caused by the line `command.script.split()[1]` because the input `command.script` is just `'git'`, which results in an `IndexError`. 

The reason behind the bug is that the function assumes that the script will always contain the subcommand 'stash' at index 1 after splitting the script by space. However, in the provided test case, the script is just 'git', and this assumption leads to an IndexError.

To fix this bug, the function should first check if the length of the split script is at least 2 before attempting to access index 1. If the length is less than 2, the function can return False immediately. This will avoid the IndexError and correctly handle cases where the script does not contain additional subcommands.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) < 2:
        return False
    return (split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will first check if the split script has at least 2 elements before attempting to access index 1. If the length is less than 2, the function will return False, avoiding the IndexError.
