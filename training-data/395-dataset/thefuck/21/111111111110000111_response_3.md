The error is occurring in the `match` function defined in the `git_fix_stash.py` file. The error message indicates that the `IndexError` is being raised at the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'` within the `match` function. This suggests that the `script` attribute of the `command` object does not contain enough elements after splitting it by whitespace.

The bug occurs because the `match` function assumes that the `command.script` will always contain at least two elements after splitting by whitespace, which is not always the case. In this specific test scenario, the `command.script` is just "git" with no additional arguments, so splitting it by whitespace will result in a list with only one element.

To fix this bug, we can add a check to ensure that the `command.script` contains at least two elements after splitting before attempting to access the second element.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_args = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_args) >= 2 and script_args[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected code, we first split the `command.script` by whitespace and store the result in the `script_args` variable. Then, we check if the length of `script_args` is at least 2 before comparing the second element with 'stash'. This change ensures that we avoid the `IndexError` when the `command.script` does not contain enough elements after splitting.
