Potential error location: The error might be in the usage of the `git_support` decorator, which is not defined or implemented in the provided code.

Reasons behind the bug: 
1. The `git_support` decorator is not defined or implemented, so using it in the function `match` causes a runtime error.
2. Without the `git_support` decorator, the syntax for the `match` function is incorrect.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Remove the `git_support` decorator if it is not needed for the functionality of the `match` function.
2. Correct the syntax of the `match` function to avoid any runtime errors.

Corrected code:

```python
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) > 1:
        return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```

In the corrected code, the `git_support` decorator has been removed and the function checks for the length of the command and then performs the comparison to avoid any index out of range errors.
