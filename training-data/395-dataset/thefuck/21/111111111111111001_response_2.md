The error is occurring at the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)` inside the `match` function. 

The issue is caused by the `command.script.split()` method, which splits the string using whitespaces and returns a list of the words. The buggy code then tries to access the second element of the list using `[1]`. However, in the given input, the `command.script` is just `'git'`, and when split, it would only have one element in the list. Thus, trying to access the second element causes the `IndexError`.

To fix this issue, we can first check if the length of the split list is greater than or equal to 2 before attempting to access the second element. If the length is less than 2, we can return `False`, indicating that the match condition is not met.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    command_split = command.script.split()
    if len(command_split) >= 2:  # Check if the split list has at least 2 elements
        return (command_split[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False  # If the split list has less than 2 elements, return False
```

This modification ensures that the code checks the length of the split list before accessing its elements, preventing the `IndexError` from occurring.
