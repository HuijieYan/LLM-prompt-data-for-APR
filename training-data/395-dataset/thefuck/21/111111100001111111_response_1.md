The bug occurs in the function `match` which is decorated with `@git_support`. The bug occurs when the `command.script` is just `'git'` and the function attempts to split it and access the second element of the resulting list, resulting in an `IndexError`.

To fix this bug, we need to check the length of the split result to ensure that it has at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This change ensures that the function won't attempt to access the second element of the split result if it doesn't exist, which will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.
