The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the `command.script` contains the word 'stash' and if the `command.stderr` contains 'usage:'. However, the bug occurs because the function doesn't account for the situation where the `command.script` doesn't have a second element after splitting by whitespace. This leads to the 'IndexError: list index out of range'.

To fix this bug:
1. We need to add a check to ensure that the `command.script` has at least two words before accessing the second element after splitting.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
