The error message indicates that an IndexError occurred at `command.script.split()[1]` in the `match` function. This suggests that the `split` method is not finding a second element in the `command.script`, causing the list index to be out of range.

The buggy function is trying to split `command.script` and retrieve the second element to compare with 'stash'. However, if `command.script` does not contain any whitespace, the `split` operation will result in a list with only one element, causing the IndexError when trying to access the second element.

To fix this issue, we need to check the length of the split list before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By checking the length of the `script_parts` list, we ensure that there is at least a second element before trying to access it. This should prevent the IndexError from occurring.
