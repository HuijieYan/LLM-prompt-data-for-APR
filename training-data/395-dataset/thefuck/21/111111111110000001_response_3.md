The bug seems to be in the `match` function of the `git_fix_stash.py` file. The error message indicates that an `IndexError` is being raised at the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`, which suggests that there might be an issue with the splitting logic of the `command.script` string.

The reason for the bug is that the function is trying to split the `command.script` without first checking if it contains multiple words, which leads to the `IndexError` when trying to access the second word in the list.

To fix the bug, the code can be modified to first check if the `command.script` contains more than one word before attempting to split it and access the second word.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) > 1 and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This modification addresses the bug by first checking if the `command.script` contains more than one word before attempting to access the second word.
