The error is occurring in the `match` function. The specific line causing the error is `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)`. The IndexError is caused by the split() function trying to access the second element of the list, but there is only one element in the list.

The bug occurs because the function is assuming that there will always be at least two elements in the `script` attribute of the `command` parameter. However, when the `script` attribute is just 'git', the split() function will only return a list with one element, causing the IndexError when trying to access the second element.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the length of the split list is at least 2 before trying to access the second element.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This fix ensures that we only attempt to access the second element of the split list if the list has at least two elements.
