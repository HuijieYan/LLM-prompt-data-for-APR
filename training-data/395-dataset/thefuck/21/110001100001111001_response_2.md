The buggy function `match` is checking if the second word in the command script is 'stash' and if the stderr contains the word 'usage:'. The issue with the current implementation is that it splits the command script using whitespaces and compares the second word with 'stash', which may not always be accurate. It also checks for the existence of 'usage:' in the stderr, which is a better approach.

To fix this, we can modify the function to directly check if the command script starts with 'git stash' and if 'usage:' is present in the stderr.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return command.script.startswith('git stash') and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

This modification ensures that the function accurately checks if the command is related to 'git stash' and verifies the presence of 'usage:' in the stderr, which aligns with the intended behavior of the function.
