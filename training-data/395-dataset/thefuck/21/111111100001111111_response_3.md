The error in the provided function `match` occurs because it tries to access the second element of the `command.script.split()` list without first checking if there is a second element. This results in an `IndexError` when `command.script` is just `'git'` as it only has one element after the split.

To fix this issue, the function needs to first check if the length of the split list is at least 2 before trying to access the second element.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) >= 2 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
