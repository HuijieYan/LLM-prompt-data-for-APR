The error message indicates that the bug is occurring in the "match" function of the "git_fix_stash" rule. Specifically, the error is an "IndexError" on line 8 of the "git_fix_stash" rule. The error occurs because the "command.script.split()" does not contain the expected number of elements.

The reason behind the bug is that the code assumes that "command.script.split()" will always contain at least two elements, and it tries to access the second element without checking for its existence. When the "command.script" does not contain the expected format, the split operation does not produce the expected number of elements, leading to the IndexError.

To fix the bug, we need to check the length of the split list before trying to access its elements. Additionally, we should validate that the split command contains the expected string 'stash' and that the 'usage:' string is present in the command.stderr.

The corrected code for the "match" function of the "git_fix_stash" rule is as follows:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    if len(split_command) > 1:
        return (split_command[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```

This modification ensures that we first validate the length of the split command before accessing its elements, preventing the IndexError. Also, if the split command does not match the expected format, the function returns False.

These changes should fix the bug by handling cases where the "command.script" does not match the expected format.
