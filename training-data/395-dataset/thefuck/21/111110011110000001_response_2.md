Potential error location: The error occurs in the `match` function when trying to access the second element of the command script using `split()`.

Reason for the bug: The error message indicates that the list index is out of range, which means that the `split()` method is being called on an empty string or a string without spaces, resulting in a single-element list or no elements at all.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Check if the `command.script` is not empty before performing the split operation.
2. Check if the split result has at least two elements before trying to access the second element.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected function
def git_support(fn):
    def wrapped(command):
        if 'usage:' in command.stderr:
            return fn(command)
        else:
            return False
    return wrapped

# Updated match function
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
