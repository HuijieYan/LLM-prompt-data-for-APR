The error message indicates an "IndexError: list index out of range" in the `match` function. This error occurs when the `split()` method is called on an empty string or a string that does not contain any spaces. 

In this case, the error occurred because the `command.script` does not contain any spaces, resulting in an empty list after splitting. 

To fix this issue, we need to handle the case where `command.script` does not contain any spaces before attempting to access the second element of the split result. 

We can use an if condition to check if the split result contains at least two elements before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# Corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
