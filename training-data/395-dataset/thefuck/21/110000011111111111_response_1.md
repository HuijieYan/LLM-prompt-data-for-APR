The bug occurs in the `match` function because it tries to access the second element of `command.script` split by spaces, causing an IndexError when `command.script` does not contain enough elements. The error message indicates that the issue is related to accessing the index of a list that is out of range.

To fix the bug, a check for the length of the split command should be added to ensure that there is at least one element in the split list before trying to access index 1.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

The updated code first splits the command script and then checks if the length of the split list is greater than 1 before accessing index 1. This approach ensures that the bug causing the IndexError is fixed, and the function should now work as expected.
