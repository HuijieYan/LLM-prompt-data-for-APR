The test case "test_not_match" is failing with the error "IndexError: list index out of range" in the function "match" within the file "/Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_21/thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py". The error is occurring because the function is trying to access the second element of the split command script without checking if it exists or not, resulting in the IndexError.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the split command script has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. We can also check if the first element is 'git' to ensure that we are analyzing a 'git' command.

The corrected code for the problematic function "match" is as follows:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_21/thefuck/rules/git_fix_stash.py

@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
  
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and
            split_script[0] == 'git' and
            split_script[1] == 'stash' and
            'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In this corrected code, we first split the command script and then check if the first element is 'git' and if the second element is 'stash' before proceeding to check for the 'usage:' in the command stderr. This modification ensures that we avoid the IndexError by checking the length of the split command script before accessing its elements.
