The test case passes a Command object with script="git" and stderr=git_stash_err to the match function. The error message indicates that the list index is out of range, specifically in the line "return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)".

The bug occurs because the split() method is applied to the script attribute of the Command object, which in this case is just "git". When split() is called on "git", it returns a list with only one element, and trying to access index 1 of the list produces an IndexError.

To fix this bug, we can add a check to ensure that the split result has at least two elements before accessing index 1.

Here's the corrected code for the match function:

```python
# corrected function
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
