The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command string contains 'stash' and if the stderr contains the specific usage message. However, the current implementation only checks for the presence of 'stash' in the second position of the command script and the presence of the usage message in the stderr. This approach is incorrect as it does not accurately capture the desired conditions for a match.

To fix this, we need to modify the `match` function to properly check for the required conditions. We should check if the command.script contains 'stash' and if the usage message is present in the command.stderr.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash':
        return 'usage:' in command.stderr
    return False
```

In the corrected code:
1. We split the command.script to extract its parts, and then we check if the second part is 'stash'.
2. If the above condition is met, we check if 'usage:' is present in the command.stderr.
3. If both conditions are true, we return True, indicating a match. Otherwise, we return False.
