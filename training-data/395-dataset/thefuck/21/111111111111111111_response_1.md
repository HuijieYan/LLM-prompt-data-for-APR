The error occurs in the `match` function of the `git_fix_stash.py` rule. The bug happens because the current implementation tries to access the second element of the `command.script.split()` list without checking if it exists. 

The script splits the command string and checks if the second split part is equal to 'stash', which will lead to an 'IndexError' if there are not enough split parts.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the split list has at least two elements before accessing the second element to avoid the 'IndexError'.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This revised code first splits the command script into parts and then checks if there are at least two parts. If so, it verifies if the second part is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr. This approach ensures that there are no index out of range errors.
