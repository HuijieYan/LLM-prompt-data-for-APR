The bug is occurring in the `match` function, which is part of a Python package called `thefuck`. The error message indicates that the `IndexError` is happening in the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'`. This means that the `split` method is failing because the `command.script` does not contain a space-separated string with at least two elements.

The reason behind this bug is that the function is assuming that the `command.script` will always have at least two elements when split by a space, but this assumption is not always true.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if `command.script` is split-able before trying to access the second element. If the split fails, we can return `False` to indicate that the match did not occur.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    try:
        script_parts = command.script.split()
        return (len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    except:
        return False
```

In this corrected code, we use a try-except block to catch the potential `IndexError` that may occur when splitting `command.script`. If an error occurs, we return `False`. Additionally, we added a check for the length of `script_parts` to ensure that it has at least two elements before accessing the second element.
