Potential error location: The error appears to be occurring in the line `return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash')` of the `match` function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The error message "IndexError: list index out of range" indicates that the script doesn't have any elements after splitting the command. This could be due to the fact that the script being passed to the function doesn't have any arguments.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the command.script has at least two elements before trying to access the second element.
2. Validate the command.script before attempting to split and access its elements.

Corrected code:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script = command.script.split()
    if len(script) > 1 and script[1] == 'stash':
        return 'usage:' in command.stderr
    return False
```
