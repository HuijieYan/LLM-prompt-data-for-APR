The error occurs in the `match` function at line 8, specifically at `command.script.split()[1]`. This code tries to access the second element of the split result from `command.script`. However, the input script in the given test case is just `'git'`, and when this is split by spaces, it will only have one element in the list resulting in the `IndexError` when trying to access index 1.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the length of the split result is greater than or equal to 2 before accessing the second element.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) >= 2:
        return (split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```

In the corrected code, we first split the `command.script` and then check the length of the split result. If the length is at least 2, we proceed to compare the second element with `'stash'` and check if `'usage:'` is present in `command.stderr`. Otherwise, we return `False`.

This should fix the `IndexError` in the `match` function when `command.script` has only one element.
