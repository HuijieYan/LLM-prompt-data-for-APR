The buggy function has the following issues:

1. The `patterns` variable is not defined within the `match` function, resulting in a NameError.
2. The commands are being accessed as attributes, but they should be accessed as dictionary keys.

To fix the issues, the `patterns` variable should be passed as a parameter to the function. Additionally, the `command` object should be accessed using dictionary keys instead of attributes.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def match(command, patterns):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in command['stderr'].lower() or pattern.lower() in command['stdout'].lower():
            return True
    return False
```

With this corrected code, the match function should work as expected for the provided test cases.
