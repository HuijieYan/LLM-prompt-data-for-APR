The potential error in the provided function is that the 'patterns' variable is not defined within the function. It seems that 'patterns' should be a list of patterns to match in the command's stderr or stdout.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is trying to iterate over 'patterns' without defining it within the function.

To fix the bug, we need to pass the 'patterns' as an argument to the 'match' function.

Here's the corrected code for the 'match' function:

```python
def match(command, patterns):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower()\
                or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
            return True
    return False
```

This corrected function takes an additional 'patterns' parameter, which should be a list of patterns to match. This way, the function will work as expected and avoid the error of trying to iterate over an undefined 'patterns' variable.
