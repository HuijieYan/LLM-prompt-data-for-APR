The error occurs because the `match` function is using the `patterns` variable without it being defined anywhere in the provided code. This is likely the cause of the "NameError: name 'patterns' is not defined" error.

To fix the bug, the `patterns` variable needs to be defined and populated with the patterns to be checked in the `match` function.

Here's the corrected `match` function with the addition of the `patterns` variable:

```python
# Define patterns to be checked
patterns = ['eDSPermissionError', 'permission denied']

# Corrected function
def match(command):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower()\
                or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
            return True
    return False
```

With this fix, the `match` function should work as expected and pass the provided test cases.
