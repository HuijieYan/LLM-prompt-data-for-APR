Potential error location: The potential error in the code is the reference to the `patterns` variable, which is not defined in the given code.

Reason for the bug: The `patterns` variable is not defined, so the function will throw an error when it tries to iterate through it.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Define the `patterns` variable within the function or pass it as an argument to the function.

Corrected code:

```python
def match(command, patterns):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower()\
                or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
            return True
    return False
```
