The test case `test_not_match` is attempting to test the `match` function by passing a `Command` object with specific attributes, including `script` and `stderr`. The error message indicates that the function is returning `True` when it should be returning `False` for the provided input.

The potential error location in the `match` function is the condition inside the for loop that checks if the pattern is in either the `stderr` or `stdout` of the command. 

The bug occurs because the `patterns` variable is not defined within the `match` function, and no other external reference to it is provided. This results in an undefined variable error, causing the function to fail.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to pass the `patterns` variable as an argument to the `match` function. Another approach is to define the `patterns` variable within the `match` function itself.

Below is the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
def match(command, patterns):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower()\
                or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
            return True
    return False
```
Alternatively, if the `patterns` variable is supposed to be a global variable or is defined elsewhere in the program, the function can be defined like this:

```python
patterns = [...]

def match(command):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower()\
                or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
            return True
    return False
```
