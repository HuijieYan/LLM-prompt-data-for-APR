The test case is trying to check if the `match()` function returns False when it receives a `Command` object with a `script` parameter of 'sudo ls' and a `stderr` parameter of 'Permission denied'.

The potential error is most likely in the `match` function itself, within the if statement that checks if the lowercase `pattern` is in the lowercase `command.stderr` or `command.stdout`.

The bug is occurring because the `command` object is not provided when calling the `match` function. This means that the `command` parameter is not initialized, causing the function to throw an error.

The bug can be fixed by passing the `command` object to the `match` function when calling it.

```python
# Corrected match function
def match(command):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower()\
                or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
            return True
    return False

# This is the corrected match() function that includes the missing command parameter
```

Once the corrected `match` function is used with a `Command` object passed to it, the test case should pass without any errors.
