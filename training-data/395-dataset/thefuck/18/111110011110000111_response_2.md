The error message is indicating that the test case `test_not_match` is failing when trying to match the Command(script='sudo ls', stderr='Permission denied'). The error is coming from the assert statement, indicating that the match function is returning True when it should be returning False.

The potential error location within the function is the comparison between the patterns and the command's stderr and stdout. The function is not handling the case where command.stderr or command.stdout is None, which might be causing the function to return incorrect results.

The bug is occurring because the function does not handle the case where command.stderr or command.stdout is None. This can be causing the comparison to fail and return incorrect results.

To fix the bug, we can add conditionals to check for None values before performing the comparison. This will ensure that the function handles all potential cases and returns the correct result.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def match(command):
    if command.stderr is not None and command.stdout is not None:
        for pattern in patterns:
            if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower()\
                    or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
                return True
    return False
```

By adding conditionals to check for None values in command.stderr and command.stdout, we ensure that the function handles all potential cases and returns the correct result. This should fix the bug and allow the test case to pass.
