Potential error locations:
1. The 'patterns' variable is not defined within the function.
2. The 'stderr' and 'stdout' attributes are not defined within the 'command' object.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The 'patterns' variable needs to be passed as an argument to the function or defined within the function's scope.
2. It seems like 'command' is expected to have 'stderr' and 'stdout' attributes, but they are not defined within the 'command' object.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define 'patterns' within the function or pass it as an argument to the function.
2. Ensure that the 'command' object has 'stderr' and 'stdout' attributes before referencing them in the function.

Corrected code:

```python
def match(command, patterns):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in command.get('stderr', '').lower()\
                or pattern.lower() in command.get('stdout', '').lower():
            return True
    return False
```

In this corrected code:
- The 'patterns' variable is passed as an argument to the function.
- The 'get' method is used to safely access the 'stderr' and 'stdout' attributes of the 'command' object to avoid potential errors.
