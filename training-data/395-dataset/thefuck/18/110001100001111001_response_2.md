Potential error location:
The potential error in the provided function is that it does not handle the case where `patterns` is not defined. 

Reason for the bug:
The function references `patterns` without defining it within the function. This will result in a NameError when the function is executed.

Approach to fix the bug:
The `patterns` variable needs to be defined within the function or passed as an argument to the function.

Corrected code:
```python
def match(command, patterns):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower() or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
            return True
    return False
```
In this corrected code, the `patterns` variable is passed as an argument to the `match` function to ensure that it is defined. This will prevent the NameError and allow the function to run as expected.
