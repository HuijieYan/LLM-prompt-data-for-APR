The potential error in the provided function is that the 'patterns' variable is not defined within the function. Therefore, the function will throw an error when trying to iterate over 'patterns' without having it defined.

The bug occurred because the 'patterns' variable is not defined within the function. This leads to an undefined variable error when trying to iterate over 'patterns'.

To fix the bug, the 'patterns' variable needs to be defined either as a global variable or passed as an argument to the function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def match(command, patterns):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower() or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
            return True
    return False
```

In this corrected code, the 'patterns' variable is passed as an argument to the 'match' function, allowing it to be properly referenced within the function.
