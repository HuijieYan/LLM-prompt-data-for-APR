Potential error: The issue may be related to the `match` function not properly checking for the presence of `sudo` in the command.

Reason for the bug: The `match` function does not properly account for the presence of `sudo` in the command and may return `True` when it shouldn't. This can lead to incorrect suggestions for fixing the command.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Modify the `match` function to specifically check for the presence of `sudo` in the command and adjust the logic accordingly.

Corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_18/thefuck/rules/sudo.py

def match(command):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower() or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
            if 'sudo' in command.script:
                return True
            else:
                return False
    return False
```
