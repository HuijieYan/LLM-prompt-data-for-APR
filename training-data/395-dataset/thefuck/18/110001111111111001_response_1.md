The error occurs because the `match` function does not have a defined `patterns` variable, causing a NameError. Additionally, the function does not have a defined `Command` class, which is causing the AssertionError in the test function.

To fix the bug, we need to define the `patterns` variable and the `Command` class. We also need to modify the `match` function to handle the input `Command` object properly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# Define the Command class
class Command:
    def __init__(self, script='', stdout='', stderr=''):
        self.script = script
        self.stdout = stdout
        self.stderr = stderr

# Define the patterns
patterns = ['eDSPermissionError']

# Corrected match function
def match(command):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower() or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
            return True
    return False
```

With these corrections, the `match` function should now handle the input `Command` object properly, and the test function should pass without any errors.
