The potential error in the provided function is with the 'patterns' variable, as it is not defined in the function. This could lead to a NameError when the function is executed.

The function is designed to check if any of the patterns in the 'patterns' list are present in the 'stderr' or 'stdout' of the 'command'. However, since 'patterns' is not defined, it will result in an error.

To fix the bug, we need to define the 'patterns' list within the function or pass it as an argument to the function.

Here's the corrected code for the 'match' function:

```python
def match(command, patterns):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower() or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
            return True
    return False
```

In this corrected code, the 'patterns' list is passed as an argument to the 'match' function so that it is defined and accessible within the function.
