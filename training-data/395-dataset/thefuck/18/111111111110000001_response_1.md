The error occurs because the 'match' function is unable to correctly identify whether a command requires the 'sudo' prefix. The function is not properly checking for the presence of the 'sudo' command in the input command.

To fix this bug, the 'match' function needs to be updated to correctly identify commands that require 'sudo'.

Here's the corrected 'match' function:

```python
def match(command):
    for pattern in ['permission denied', 'is not recognized']:
        if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower():
            return True
    return False
```
