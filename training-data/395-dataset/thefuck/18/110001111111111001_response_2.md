The error occurs due to the `match` function not handling the input parameters correctly. It seems that the function is expecting the `stderr` and `stdout` attributes to be present in the `command` object, but they might not always be present.

The potential error location is in the line:
```python
if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower()\
                or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
```

The bug occurs because the function assumes that `command.stderr` and `command.stdout` are always present, which might not be the case.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `command.stderr` and `command.stdout` exist before trying to access their values. We can do this by modifying the function as follows:

```python
def match(command):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if command.stderr and pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower()\
                or command.stdout and pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
            return True
    return False
```

This modification checks if `command.stderr` and `command.stdout` exist before trying to access their values, avoiding potential errors when they are not present.
