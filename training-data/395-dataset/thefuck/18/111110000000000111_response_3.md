Potential Error Location: 

The potential error in the code is in the `match` function. The `patterns` variable is not defined within the function, so it is unclear what it represents.

Reason Behind the Bug:

The `patterns` variable is being used in the `match` function without being defined within the function. This means that the function is unable to access the `patterns` variable and will result in a NameError.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:

1. Define the `patterns` variable within the `match` function to ensure it is accessible.
2. Pass the `patterns` variable as an argument to the `match` function.

Corrected Code:

```python
def match(command, patterns):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower()\
                or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
            return True
    return False
```
