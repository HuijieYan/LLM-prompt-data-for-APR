The buggy function is intended to check if any of the patterns in a list called 'patterns' exist in the stdout or stderr of the command. However, there are no patterns defined in the 'patterns' list, which will cause an error. Additionally, accessing the 'stderr' and 'stdout' attributes of the command without checking if they exist can also lead to errors.

To fix this, we need to define patterns in the 'patterns' list and also handle cases where 'stderr' and 'stdout' are None.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def match(command):
    patterns = ['eDSPermissionError', 'permission denied']  # Define patterns here
    if command.stderr is not None and command.stdout is not None:
        for pattern in patterns:
            if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower() or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
                return True
    return False
```
