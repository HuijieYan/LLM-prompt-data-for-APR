# Error location and reason
The potential error location is the comparison of the pattern with the command's stderr and stdout. The bug is caused by the case sensitivity of the comparison. The function compares the pattern with the command's stderr and stdout without considering the case sensitivity, which may lead to false negative results for matches.

# Approach to fix the bug
To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the pattern and the command's stderr and stdout to lowercase before comparing them.

# Corrected code
```python
def match(command):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower()\
                or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
            return True
    return False
```
