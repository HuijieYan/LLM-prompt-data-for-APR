The error is occurring because the function 'match' is missing the 'patterns' variable. This variable is being used in the function, but it is not defined within the function, causing a NameError.

To fix this issue, the 'patterns' variable must be defined or passed as a parameter to the 'match' function.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def match(command, patterns):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower()\
                or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
            return True
    return False
```

The code above takes an extra parameter 'patterns', which must be provided when calling the function 'match'. This allows the function to use the 'patterns' variable and avoid the NameError.

The test function should be updated to pass the 'patterns' parameter when calling the 'match' function.
