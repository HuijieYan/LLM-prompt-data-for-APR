The error message states that the test is failing because the function "match" is returning True when it should be False. The test case includes a Command with script='sudo ls' and stderr='Permission denied', but the "match" function is erroneously returning True for this input.

The potential error location within the "match" function is the conditional statement that checks if a pattern is present in the command's stderr or stdout.

The bug occurs because the "match" function is incorrectly checking if a pattern is present in the command's stderr or stdout using the lowercased version of the pattern. This may lead to incorrect matches when the actual case of the pattern matters.

To fix the bug, we should compare the patterns with the stderr and stdout without converting them to lowercase. This will ensure that the pattern matching is case-sensitive.

Here's the corrected code for the "match" function:

```python
def match(command):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern in command.stderr or pattern in command.stdout:
            return True
    return False
```

By making this change, the "match" function will correctly handle case-sensitive pattern matching for the command's stderr and stdout.
