The issue in the provided function is that the `patterns` variable is not defined within the `match` function. Additionally, the `patterns` variable should be case insensitive, but the function is comparing it without considering case sensitivity.

To fix the bug, we need to define the `patterns` variable and perform a case-insensitive comparison. Here's the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_18/thefuck/rules/sudo.py

patterns = ['eDSPermissionError']

def match(command):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower() \
                or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
            return True
    return False
```

This code defines the `patterns` variable and ensures that the comparison is case insensitive by converting both the pattern and the input strings to lowercase before comparison.
