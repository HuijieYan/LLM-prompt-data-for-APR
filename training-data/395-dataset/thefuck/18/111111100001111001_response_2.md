The buggy function is intended to check if any pattern in the `patterns` list is present in the `command.stderr` or `command.stdout`. However, the code has an issue with case-sensitive matching, which leads to incorrect behavior.

In the first test case, the `pattern` variable is compared with `command.stderr` without case normalization, which could lead to a false negative match.

In the second test case, the `pattern` is also not normalized to lowercase, causing a case-sensitive comparison to produce a false negative match.

To fix the bug, we need to normalize both the `pattern` and the `command.stderr` to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def match(command):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower() or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
            return True
    return False
```

With this change, the function will correctly check for the presence of patterns in the `command.stderr` and `command.stdout` in a case-insensitive manner.
