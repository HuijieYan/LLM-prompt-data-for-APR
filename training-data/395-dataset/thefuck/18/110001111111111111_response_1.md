The bug occurs in the `match` function. The function is designed to iterate through a list of patterns and check if any of those patterns are found in the `command.stderr` or `command.stdout`. If they are found, the function returns True.

In the first test case, `command.stderr` and `command.stdout` are both empty, so the function should return False. In the second test case, `command.stderr` contains the string "Permission denied" and `command.stdout` is empty, so the function should also return False.

The bug occurs because the function compares the patterns with the command output in a case-sensitive manner, but the patterns are all in lowercase. This causes the function to fail to match the patterns with the command output.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that both the patterns and the command output are compared in the same case (either all lowercase or all uppercase).

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
def match(command):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower() or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
            return True
    return False
```

With this correction, the function will now compare the patterns and the command output in a case-insensitive manner, fixing the bug.
