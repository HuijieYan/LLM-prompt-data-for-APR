The potential error in the given function lies in the comparison of the patterns with the `command.stderr` and `command.stdout` values. The comparison is case-sensitive, but the patterns and the `command.stderr` and `command.stdout` values may not always have the same case.

The bug occurs because the function is comparing the patterns with the `command.stderr` and `command.stdout` without considering the case sensitivity. As a result, it may not match the patterns if the case does not match.

To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive. One way to do this is by converting both the patterns and the `command.stderr` and `command.stdout` values to lowercase before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def match(command):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower() or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
            return True
    return False
```
