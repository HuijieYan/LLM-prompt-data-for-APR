The bug is caused by the use of the variable `patterns` in the `match` function, which is not defined in the function. As a result, the function is unable to compare the pattern with the command's stderr and stdout, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the patterns variable needs to be defined or passed as a parameter to the match function.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def match(command, patterns):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower()\
                or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
            return True
    return False
```

The match function now takes an additional parameter `patterns` which contains the patterns to match. This ensures that the function has access to the necessary patterns for comparison.

For the tests, the match function needs to be called with the patterns parameter. The test function should be modified as follows:

```python
def test_not_match():
    assert not match(Command(), ['eDSPermissionError'])
    assert not match(Command(script='sudo ls', stderr='Permission denied'), ['permission denied'])
```

By passing the patterns as a parameter, the match function can now correctly compare the patterns with the command's stderr and stdout, providing the expected results.
