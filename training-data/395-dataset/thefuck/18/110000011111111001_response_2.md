The error is occurring because the `match` function is not handling the input parameters correctly. The function is trying to access the `stderr` and `stdout` attributes of the `command` object without checking if they exist. This results in an AttributeError when the `command` object does not have the `stderr` and `stdout` attributes.

To fix this issue, the function needs to check if the `command` object has the `stderr` and `stdout` attributes before accessing them.

The corrected code for the `match` function is as follows:

```python
def match(command):
    if hasattr(command, 'stderr') and hasattr(command, 'stdout'):
        for pattern in patterns:
            if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower() or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
                return True
    return False
```

With this modification, the `match` function will first check if the `stderr` and `stdout` attributes exist in the `command` object before performing any operations on them. This will prevent the AttributeError and fix the bug.
