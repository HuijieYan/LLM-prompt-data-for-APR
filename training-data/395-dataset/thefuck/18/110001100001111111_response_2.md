The bug occurred because the function is trying to access a variable `patterns` which is not defined. Additionally, the function is checking if a pattern exists in the command's stderr or stdout, but the actual pattern to be checked is not defined.

To fix the bug, the `patterns` variable should be defined and initialized with the patterns to be checked. Then, the function should loop through each pattern and check if it exists in the command's stderr or stdout.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def match(command):
    patterns = ['eDSPermissionError', 'permission denied']  # Define the patterns to check
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower() or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
            return True  # Return True if a pattern is found
    return False  # Return False if no pattern is found
```
