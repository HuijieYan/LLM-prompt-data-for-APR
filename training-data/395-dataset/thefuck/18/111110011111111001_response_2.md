The potential error location within the function is in the comparison of the pattern with the command's stderr and stdout. The issue arises from the fact that the command object does not have stderr and stdout attributes, and these comparisons are expected to return errors.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is trying to access attributes (stderr and stdout) that do not exist in the Command object.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to accept the stderr and stdout values as parameters. This way, the function will not attempt to access attributes that do not exist.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def match(command, stderr_val, stdout_val, patterns):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in stderr_val.lower() or pattern.lower() in stdout_val.lower():
            return True
    return False
```

In this corrected code:
- The function now accepts the command, stderr, stdout, and patterns as parameters.
- The comparisons are made between the patterns and the passed stderr and stdout values, avoiding any attempts to access non-existing attributes.
