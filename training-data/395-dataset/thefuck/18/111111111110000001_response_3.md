1. The test case is checking if the `match` function returns `False` for a `Command` object with `script='sudo ls'` and `stderr='Permission denied'`. The error message indicates that the `match` function is returning `True` instead of `False` for this `Command` object.

2. The potential error location within the `match` function is the conditional statements that check if the `pattern` is in the `command.stderr` or `command.stdout`.

3. The bug occurs because the `match` function is not handling the case where the `command.stderr` is not empty, but it does not contain any of the `patterns`. As a result, the `match` function returns `True` incorrectly.

4. One possible approach to fixing the bug is to add an additional condition to check if `command.stderr` and `command.stdout` are not empty before performing the pattern matching. This ensures that the `match` function only returns `True` if the `patterns` are found in `command.stderr` or `command.stdout`.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
def match(command):
    if command.stderr and command.stdout:
        for pattern in patterns:
            if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower()\
                    or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
                return True
    return False
```
