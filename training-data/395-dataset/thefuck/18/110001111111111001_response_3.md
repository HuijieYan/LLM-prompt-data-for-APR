The issue with the `match` function is that it references a variable `patterns` without defining it. Since `patterns` is not defined in the given code snippet, it will cause a NameError.

To fix the issue, the `patterns` variable needs to be defined within the `match` function, or it needs to be passed as a parameter to the `match` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
def match(command, patterns):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower()\
                or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
            return True
    return False
```

And an updated test function:
```python
def test_not_match():
    assert not match(Command(), ['eDSPermissionError'])
    assert not match(Command(script='sudo ls', stderr='Permission denied'), ['permission denied'])
```

In this corrected code, the `patterns` variable is passed as a parameter to the `match` function, and it is used to check for patterns in the `command` object.
