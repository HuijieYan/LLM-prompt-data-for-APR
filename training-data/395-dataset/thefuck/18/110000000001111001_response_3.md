Potential error location: The buggy function is not handling the case where the `patterns` array is empty.

Reason for the bug: The buggy function does not check if the `patterns` array is empty before iterating through it. This can cause the function to throw an error when an empty array is passed as input.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: 
1. Add a condition to check if the `patterns` array is empty before iterating through it.
2. If the array is empty, return False immediately.

Corrected code:

```python
def match(command):
    if not patterns:
        return False
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower() or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
            return True
    return False
```
