1. The test case `test_not_match()` is checking the `match()` function with a `Command()` object that has specific attributes (`script` and `stderr`). The first assertion is checking if the `match()` function returns `False` with an empty `Command()` object, which is expected. However, the second assertion is checking if the `match()` function returns `False` with a `Command()` object that has the `script` attribute set to 'sudo ls' and the `stderr` attribute set to 'Permission denied'. The error message indicates that the `match()` function is returning `True` instead of `False` in this case.

2. The potential error location within the `match()` function is the condition that checks if a pattern is present in the `command.stderr` or `command.stdout`. It seems that the matching logic is not working correctly for the given input.

3. The bug is occurring because the `match()` function is not properly matching the patterns in the `command.stderr` and `command.stdout`. This is leading to incorrect results being returned, causing the test case to fail.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the matching logic properly checks for the presence of patterns in the `command.stderr` and `command.stdout`, and returns `True` only if a pattern is found in either of them.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `match()` function:

```python
def match(command, patterns):
    for pattern in patterns:
        if pattern.lower() in command.script.lower()\
                or pattern.lower() in command.stderr.lower()\
                or pattern.lower() in command.stdout.lower():
            return True
    return False
```

In this corrected code, the `match()` function now takes an additional parameter `patterns` to ensure that the patterns are passed to the function. The function now checks for the presence of patterns in `command.script`, `command.stderr`, and `command.stdout` to determine if a match is found.
