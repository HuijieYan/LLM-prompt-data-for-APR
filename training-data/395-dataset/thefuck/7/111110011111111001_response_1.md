The problem with the original code is that it checks if the string 'php -s' is present anywhere in the `command.script`. This will return True for the second test case, which is not the expected behavior.

To fix this, we need to modify the `match` function to check if 'php -s' is present at the beginning of the `command.script`.

```python
# Corrected function
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return command.script.startswith("php -s")
```

The original code returned True even when the string 'php -s' was present in the middle of `command.script`, which was not the expected behavior. The corrected code checks for the presence of 'php -s' at the beginning of `command.script`, providing the expected behavior for the given test cases.
