The buggy function is supposed to check if the command contains "php -s", but the current implementation checks if the entire command script is equal to "php -s". This will not work for commands like "php -s localhost:8000" because the entire string does not match exactly.

To fix this, we need to check if "php -s" is present in the command.script, which will cover cases where it is followed by additional arguments like in the input examples provided.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return "php -s" in command.script
```
