The buggy function is a Python function that is intended to check if the command script contains the string "php -s". However, the implementation of the function is incorrect, as it simply checks if "php -s" is present in the entire command script string.

The potential error location is the return statement inside the match function.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is using a simple string check to validate the command script, which does not accurately check if the command script contains the exact string "php -s".

To fix the bug, we need to check if "php -s" is a standalone word in the command script, rather than just a part of the script string.

Here's the corrected code for the match function:

```python
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return "php -s" in command.script.split()
```

By using the split() method on the command script, we can check if "php -s" is a standalone word in the script, which addresses the buggy behavior in the original implementation.
