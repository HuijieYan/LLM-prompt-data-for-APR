# Corrected function source code
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_7/thefuck/rules/php_s.py

# corrected function
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return "php -s" in command.script.split()
```

The corrected function `match` checks if "php -s" exists in the command.script after splitting it into words.

Now the test function should pass without any errors.
