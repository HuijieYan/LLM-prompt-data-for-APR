The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command contains "php -s" in its script, and return True if it does. However, the current implementation is checking if the entire string "php -s" is present in the command.script, which is not correct. It should only check if "php -s" is a substring of the command.script.

This is causing the test to fail because in the second case, "php -s" is not present as a whole string in the command.script, resulting in the function returning False.

To fix this bug, the match function needs to be modified to check if "php -s" is a substring of the command.script.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return "php -s" in command.script
```

Now, with the corrected implementation, the test case should pass successfully.
