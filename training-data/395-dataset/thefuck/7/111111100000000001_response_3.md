The buggy function is intended to match commands related to PHP by checking if "php -s" is present in the command script. However, the current implementation of the function is incorrect.

The potential error in the function is the use of the `in` operator to check for an exact match of "php -s" in the command.script. This is incorrect as it will return True for any command that contains "php -s" anywhere within it.

To fix the bug, the function should use the `==` operator to check for an exact match with "php -s" in the command.script.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_7/thefuck/rules/php_s.py

@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return "php -s" == command.script
```
