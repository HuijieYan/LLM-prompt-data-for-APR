Potential error location: 
The issue lies in the condition "php -s" in command.script. This condition checks if "php -s" is present in the script, but it should actually check if the script is invoking the "php" command with the "-s" option.

Reason for the bug:
The current implementation checks for the exact string "php -s" in the command script, which may not accurately reflect the actual usage of the "php -s" command.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
We need to modify the condition to accurately check if the script is invoking the "php" command with the "-s" option.

Corrected code:

```python
# Corrected function
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return command.script.startswith("php -s")
```
