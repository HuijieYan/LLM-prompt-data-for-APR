The buggy function is attempting to check if the string "php -s" is present in the `command.script`. However, the current implementation will return True for any command that contains the substring "php -s", regardless of the rest of the command. This is because the `in` operator is checking for a substring match within the `command.script`.

To fix this, we should use the `==` operator to check if the entire script is exactly equal to "php -s".

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def match(command):
    return command.script == 'php -s'
```
