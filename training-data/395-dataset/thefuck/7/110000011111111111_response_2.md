The buggy function `match` is using the `@for_app('php')` decorator, which suggests that it is meant to match commands specific to the 'php' application. However, the implementation of the function only checks whether the string "php -s" is present in the command script, which is not a reliable way to determine if the command is for the 'php' application.

The error message from the test function indicates that the `match` function returned `False` for the command `Command(script=php -t pub -s 0.0.0.0:8080, output=)`, which is incorrect.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `return "php -s" in command.script` statement. The implementation should be more specific in identifying commands for the 'php' application based on the command script.

To fix this, we need to update the `match` function to check for specific characteristics of the PHP command, such as starting with "php -s" or "php -t".

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return command.script.startswith("php -s") or command.script.startswith("php -t")
```

With this correction, the `match` function will correctly identify commands for the 'php' application based on whether they start with "php -s" or "php -t".

This should resolve the issue and make the test cases pass.
