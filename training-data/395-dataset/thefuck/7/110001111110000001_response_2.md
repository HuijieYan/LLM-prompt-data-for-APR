The potential error location within the problematic function is the `match` function, specifically in the line `return "php -s" in command.script`. The bug occurs because the `match` function is checking if the entire string "php -s" is present in the `command.script`. However, in the test cases, the script contains additional text after "php -s". This causes the function to return `False` and fail the test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `match` function to check if "php -s" is present as a substring in the `command.script`, rather than checking for an exact match.

Here's the corrected `match` function:

```python
# Corrected function
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return "php -s" in command.script
```

This will check if "php -s" is present in the `command.script` without requiring an exact match.
