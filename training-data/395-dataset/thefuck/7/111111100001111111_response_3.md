The buggy function is trying to match the input command with the string "php -s", however, it's not handling the cases when there are additional arguments or parameters after the "php -s" part of the command.

The error occurs because the buggy function checks if "php -s" is present in the entire command string, which causes it to fail when there are additional parameters after "php -s".

To fix this, the function needs to split the command into individual parts and then check for the presence of "php -s" at the beginning of the command.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    parts = command.script.split()
    return parts[0] == "php" and "-s" in parts
```
