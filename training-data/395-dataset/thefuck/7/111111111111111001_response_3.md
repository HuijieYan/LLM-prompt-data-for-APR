The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the command script contains the substring "php -s". However, the bug occurs because the function is using the `in` keyword to check for an exact match, but the script contains additional text before and after "php -s". This causes the function to return `False` even when the script contains "php -s".

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to use the `in` keyword to check if "php -s" is present anywhere in the script without any additional constraints.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return "php -s" in command.script
```

This should address the issue and ensure that the function returns the correct result when checking for the presence of "php -s" in the command script.
