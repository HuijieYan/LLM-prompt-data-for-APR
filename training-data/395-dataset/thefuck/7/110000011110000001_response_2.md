The issue with the current `match` function is that it checks for the exact string "php -s" in the `command.script`. However, in the test case `Command('php -t pub -s 0.0.0.0:8080', '')`, the string "php -s" is not directly present in the `command.script`, which causes the function to return False.

To fix this, we need to modify the `match` function to check whether "php" and "-s" are present as separate elements in the `command.script` instead of checking for the exact string "php -s".

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return "php" in command.script and "-s" in command.script
```

This modification ensures that the function checks for the presence of both "php" and "-s" as separate elements in the `command.script`, making it more flexible and capable of handling various command patterns.
