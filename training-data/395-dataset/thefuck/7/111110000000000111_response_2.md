Potential Error location: The condition `return "php -s" in command.script` is incorrect. It checks if the entire string "php -s" is present in `command.script`, which is not the intended functionality.

Reason for the Bug: The current condition does not check if the command matches "php -s", but rather if it is a subset of the command, which might lead to incorrect results.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug: We need to check if the command exactly matches "php -s", rather than checking for its presence as a substring.

Corrected Code:

```python
# corrected function
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return command.script.strip() == "php -s"
```
