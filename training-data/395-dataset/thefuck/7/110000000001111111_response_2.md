The buggy function `match` is a decorator function that checks if the command script contains the string "php -s". However, the implementation is incorrect as it is checking if the entire string "php -s" is present in the command script rather than checking for the substring.

To fix the bug, the `match` function should be corrected to check if "php -s" is a substring of the command script rather than an exact match for the entire string.

```python
# Corrected function
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return "php -s" in command.script
```

This corrected code will accurately check if the substring "php -s" is present in the command script, and it aligns with the expected behavior for the provided test cases.
