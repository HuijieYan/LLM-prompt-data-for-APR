The problem with the `match` function is that it checks for the exact string "php -s" in the command.script, which will not match if there are any additional parameters after "php -s". This is evident from the failed test case where the command.script is 'php -t pub -s 0.0.0.0:8080'.

To fix the bug, the match function should use a different approach to check if "php -s" is present in the command.script. One possible approach is to split the command.script into individual words and check if "php" and "-s" are present in the list of words.

```python
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return "php" in words and "-s" in words
```

This approach will correctly identify if "php -s" is present in the command.script, regardless of any additional parameters.
