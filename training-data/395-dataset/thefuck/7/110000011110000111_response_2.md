The error occurs when the `match` function is called with a command that contains "php -s" as a substring. The `match` function incorrectly checks if "php -s" is in the `command.script`, but this would also return `True` for commands like "php -t pub -s 0.0.0.0:8080".

The potential error location is the `match` function, where the condition `return "php -s" in command.script` is incorrectly used to check for an exact match of "php -s" in the command script.

The buggy function uses the `in` keyword to check for the presence of "php -s" as a substring in the command script, instead of checking for an exact match.

To fix the bug, we should use the `==` operator to check if the whole command script is exactly "php -s".

```python
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return command.script == "php -s"
```

This corrected function will now return `True` only if the entire `command.script` is exactly "php -s", resolving the bug.
