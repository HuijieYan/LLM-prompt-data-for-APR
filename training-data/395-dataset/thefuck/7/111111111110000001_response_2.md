The buggy function `match(command)` is supposed to check if the command script contains the string "php -s". However, it currently checks if the exact string "php -s" is in the command script, which doesn't account for any other characters before or after it.

The potential error location is the `return "php -s" in command.script` line, as it does not accurately check for the presence of "php -s" in the command script.

The reason behind the bug is that the current implementation of the `match` function only checks for the exact string "php -s" in the command script, and returns a boolean indicating its presence without considering any other characters before or after it.

To fix the bug, the `match` function should be updated to use a regular expression to accurately check if "php -s" is present in the command script.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function with the fix:

```python
import re

@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return re.search(r'php\s*-s', command.script) is not None
```

With this fix, the `match` function now uses a regular expression to check if "php -s" is present in the command script. This will accurately determine if the command matches the specified pattern.
