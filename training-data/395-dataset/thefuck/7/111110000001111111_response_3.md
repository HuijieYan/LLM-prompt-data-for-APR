The buggy function is attempting to check if the string "php -s" is present in the command.script. However, it's not directly checking if the string "php -s" is present as a whole, but rather if "php -s" is a part of the command.script. This is not the correct way to check for an exact match.

To fix this bug, we need to use the `==` operator to check for an exact match with the command.script.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return command.script == "php -s"
```
