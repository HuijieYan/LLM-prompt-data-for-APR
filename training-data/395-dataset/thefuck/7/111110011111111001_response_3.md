The `match` function is supposed to check if the command script contains the string "php -s". However, the current implementation checks if the exact string "php -s" is present in the command script.

The error message from the test function indicates that the `match` function is returning `False` for the input `'php -t pub -s 0.0.0.0:8080'`, which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, the `match` function needs to check if "php -s" is present in the command script, not an exact match.

Here's the corrected `match` function:

```python
# Corrected function
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return "php -s" in command.script
```

With this correction, the `match` function will correctly check if "php -s" is present as a substring in the command script, and the test case should pass without any errors.
