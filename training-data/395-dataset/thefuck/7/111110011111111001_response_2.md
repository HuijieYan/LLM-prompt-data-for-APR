The buggy function is a decorator `@for_app('php')` that checks if the string "php -s" is present in the `command.script`. The bug occurs because the function is checking for the exact string "php -s" instead of checking if "php -s" is a part of the command script.

The bug is caused by the `in` operator where it checks for an exact match of "php -s" in the command script, but it should be checking if "php -s" is a substring of the command script. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to use the `in` operator correctly and check for "php -s" as a substring in the command script.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
# Corrected function
def match(command):
    return "php -s" in command.script
```
