The error message indicates that the test is failing because the `match` function is returning `False` when it is expected to return `True`. The `match` function is designed to check if the command script contains the string "php -s", however, it only checks for an exact match of the string "php -s", which is not the actual behavior that is needed.

The potential error location is within the `match` function, where it checks for an exact match of "php -s" in the command's script.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `match` function is incorrectly checking for an exact match of "php -s" instead of looking for the presence of "php -s" as a substring within the command's script.

To fix the bug and the function, it needs to verify the occurrence of "php -s" as a substring in the command's script.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return "php -s" in command.script
```

With this correction, the `match` function will correctly check if "php -s" is present as a substring within the command's script, and the test cases provided should pass without any errors.
