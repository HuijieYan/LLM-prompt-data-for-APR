The error seems to be in the `match` function. It is supposed to check if the command contains "php -s", but the implementation is incorrect.

The bug occurs because the `match` function is checking for the presence of "php -s" in the entire command script, rather than just checking if "php -s" is a standalone command. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `match` function to check if "php -s" is a standalone command within the script.

Here is the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_7/thefuck/rules/php_s.py

from thefuck.utils import for_app

@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return "php -s" in command.script.split() and "-s" in command.script.split()
```

This fixed `match` function checks if "php -s" is present in the script and ensures that "-s" is a standalone command within the script, preventing false positives.
