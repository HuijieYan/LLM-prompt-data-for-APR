The provided test case is checking for the match function to return True, but it's returning False. This indicates that the issue is with the match function itself.

The potential error in the match function is the condition "php -s" in command.script. This condition checks if the string "php -s" is present in the command.script. However, in the test cases provided, the string "php -s" is not present as a whole but as part of another string (e.g., "php -s localhost:8000"). Therefore, the condition will return False.

To fix the bug, instead of checking for an exact match, we can use the "in" operator to check if "php -t" and "-s" are present in the command.script string. This will allow for a match if either "php -s" or "php -t" is present in the script.

Here's the corrected code for the match function:

```python
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return "php -s" in command.script or "php -t" in command.script
```
