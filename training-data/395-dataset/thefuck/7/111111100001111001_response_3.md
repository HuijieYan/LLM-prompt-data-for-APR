The buggy function `match` is attempting to check if the command script contains the substring "php -s". However, the implementation is incorrect as it directly checks if "php -s" is in the entire script, which does not account for the potential presence of additional parameters or values after "php -s" in the command.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the implementation to properly check if "php -s" is present in the command without any additional characters after it.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_7/thefuck/rules/php_s.py

# corrected function
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return command.script.startswith("php -s ")
```

In this corrected code, we use the `startswith` method to check whether the command script starts with the string "php -s ". This allows us to accurately determine the presence of "php -s" at the beginning of the command without any additional characters.
