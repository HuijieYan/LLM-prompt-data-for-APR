The potential error in the given function is that it is using the decorator `@for_app('php')` which seems to be intended to specify that this function is applicable for PHP applications. However, the implementation of the function itself does not use this decorator in any way, and the returned value does not seem to match the expected behavior of a function targeting PHP applications.

It seems like the intended functionality of this function is to check if the command contains the string "php -s". If so, the function should return True, indicating that the command is related to starting a PHP server.

To fix this bug, the function should check if "php -s" is in the command script, and return True if it is, and False otherwise.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
# Corrected function
def match(command):
    return "php -s" in command.script
```
