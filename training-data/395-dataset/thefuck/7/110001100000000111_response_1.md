Potential Error Location:
The "match" function is expecting the command.script to contain the exact string "php -s", which is unlikely to be the case in most scenarios.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The "match" function is incorrectly checking for the exact string "php -s" in the command.script, which is not a reliable way to determine if the command is for PHP.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
We can use regular expressions to check if the command.script contains "php -s" as a part of it, rather than an exact match.

Corrected Code:
```python
import re

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_7/thefuck/rules/php_s.py

# corrected function
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return re.search(r'php -s', command.script) is not None
```
