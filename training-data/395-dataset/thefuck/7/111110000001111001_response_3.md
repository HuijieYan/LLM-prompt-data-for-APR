The buggy function is using the `@for_app` decorator which is not a standard decorator and it is not clear what it does. This is likely causing the function to not work as intended.

Based on the expected variable values and types in the tests, it seems like the function is supposed to check if the string "php -s" is present in the command script.

To fix this bug, we can remove the `@for_app('php')` decorator and simply check for the presence of "php -s" in the `command.script` string.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def match(command):
    return "php -s" in command.script
```
