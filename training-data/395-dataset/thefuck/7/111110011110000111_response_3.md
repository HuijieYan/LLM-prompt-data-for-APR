The potential error in the provided function is the usage of `in` operator to check if "php -s" is in `command.script`, which will return True even if only "php -s" is a substring of `command.script`. This is not the intended behavior as the function should specifically check if "php -s" is the exact value of `command.script`.

The reason behind the bug is that the `in` operator is used for substring matching, not exact value matching.

To fix the bug, we should use the equality operator '==' to check if "php -s" is the exact value of `command.script`.

The corrected code for the problematic function is:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return command.script == "php -s"
```
