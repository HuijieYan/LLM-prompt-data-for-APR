Potential error location:
The issue lies in the implementation of the "match" function which is using the @for_app('php') decorator. The function is expected to check if the command script contains "php -s", but the implementation is incorrect.

Reason behind the bug:
The condition "php -s" in command.script is not checking for an exact match and may return incorrect results.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use regex to check for the exact presence of "php -s" in the command script.
2. Change the condition to use the "==" operator to check for an exact match.

Corrected code:
```python
import re

@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return re.search(r'\bphp -s\b', command.script) is not None
```
