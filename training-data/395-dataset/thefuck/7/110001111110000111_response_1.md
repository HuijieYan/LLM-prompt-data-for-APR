The potential error location within the problematic function is the `match` function. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `match` function is checking if the string "php -s" is present in the entire command script, which is not true.

To fix the bug, the `match` function needs to be updated to check if the entire command script starts with "php -s".

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_7/thefuck/rules/php_s.py

# Corrected function
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return command.script.startswith('php -s')
```

This change will fix the bug identified in the `match` function and ensure that the test case passes without any errors.
