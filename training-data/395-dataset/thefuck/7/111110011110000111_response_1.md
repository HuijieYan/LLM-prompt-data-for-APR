The error occurs because the `match` function checks if the string "php -s" is present in the command script, but the test cases pass commands that include additional parameters after "php -s". This causes the function to return False, leading to the assertion error in the test.

To fix the bug, the `match` function should check if "php -s" is present at the beginning of the command script instead of checking for an exact match.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return command.script.startswith("php -s")
```

With this correction, the `match` function will correctly check if the script starts with "php -s", allowing the test cases to pass without causing an assertion error.
