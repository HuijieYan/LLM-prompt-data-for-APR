The problem with the current `match` function is that it checks if the string "php -s" is present in the entire `command.script` string, which causes it to return `False` for the second test case even though "php -s" is present in the command. This is because "php -s" is not a direct substring of the `command.script` string and is separated by other characters.

To fix this issue, the function should split the `command.script` string by spaces and then check if "php" is present in the resulting list. This would allow it to accurately determine if the command involves running PHP through a server.

The corrected code for the `match` function is as follows:

```python
from thefuck.utils import for_app

@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return 'php' in command.script.split()  # check if 'php' is in the split command
```

With this change, the `match` function will accurately detect whether the command involves running PHP, and the test cases should pass as expected.
