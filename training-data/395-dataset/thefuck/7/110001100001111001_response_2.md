The buggy function is meant to check if the input command contains the string "php -s". However, the current implementation checks if "php -s" is present in the entire command script, which can lead to false positives. For example, if the command is "php -t pub -s 0.0.0.0:8080", the current implementation would still return True.

To fix this, we should split the command script into separate words and check if "php" and "-s" are consecutive.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    words = command.script.split()
    return "php" in words and "-s" in words and words.index("php") + 1 == words.index("-s")
```
