Potential error location: The "match" function is using the "@for_app('php')" decorator, but it seems to be incorrectly implemented.

Reason for the bug: The "@for_app('php')" decorator is not properly defined, which is causing the function to not work as intended.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Remove the "@for_app('php')" decorator and directly check if "php -s" is in the command script.

Corrected code:
```python
def match(command):
    return "php -s" in command.script
```
