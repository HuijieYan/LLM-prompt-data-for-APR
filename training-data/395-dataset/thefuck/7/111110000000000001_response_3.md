The provided function is intended to check if the command script contains the string "php -s". However, the usage of the decorator `@for_app('php')` suggests that this function should be specifically related to PHP applications. Since the decorator is not defined in the code provided, it is assumed that it might be a custom decorator related to an application framework or library.

The potential error in this function is the incorrect use of the decorator, which might lead to unexpected behavior or errors when the function is called.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the `@for_app('php')` decorator and simply check if the string "php -s" is in the command.script.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def match(command):
    return "php -s" in command.script
```

By removing the decorator, the function now simply checks if "php -s" is present in the `command.script`, which is more in line with the original intention of the function.
