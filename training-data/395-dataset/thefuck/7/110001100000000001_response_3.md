Potential Error Location: The return statement in the match function is checking if the string "php -s" is present in the entire command script, which is not the correct way to check for a command in this context.

Reason for the Bug: The bug occurs because the return statement is not correctly checking for the presence of the "php -s" command in the input script.

Possible Fix: We need to check if "php -s" is the command being used in the input script, rather than just checking if it's present in the script.

Corrected Code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_7/thefuck/rules/php_s.py

# this is the corrected function
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return command.script.startswith("php -s")
```
