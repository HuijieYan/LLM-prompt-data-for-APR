The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command contains the string "php -s". However, there is an error in the implementation of the function, which leads to the test case failing.

The error occurs because the function `match` is incorrectly checking for the exact string "php -s" in the command script. Instead, it should be checking if "php -s" is present as a substring within the command script.

To fix the bug, the `match` function should be updated to use the `in` keyword to check for the presence of "php -s" within the command script.

```python
# Corrected function
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return "php -s" in command.script
```

With this correction, the `match` function will correctly check if the command script contains the substring "php -s", and the test case will pass as expected.
