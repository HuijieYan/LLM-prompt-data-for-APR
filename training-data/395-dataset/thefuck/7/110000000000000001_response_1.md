The buggy function "match" is a decorator function that seems to check if the command contains the string "php -s". However, the use of the decorator syntax is not correct in this context. Decorators are used to modify functions, not to check if a certain command is present in the script.

The potential error in the code is the incorrect use of the decorator syntax and the misunderstanding of its purpose.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the decorator syntax and simply define a function that performs the desired check.

Corrected code for the "match" function:

```python
def match(command):
    return "php -s" in command.script
```

By removing the decorator syntax, we have defined a standalone function that correctly checks if the given command script contains the string "php -s".
