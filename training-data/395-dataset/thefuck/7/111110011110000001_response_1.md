The potential error in the provided function is the use of the `@for_app('php')` decorator, which is not a valid Python decorator.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `@for_app('php')` decorator is not a standard Python decorator, and it is likely a custom decorator specific to a particular framework or library.

To fix the bug, the `@for_app('php')` decorator should be removed, and the function should simply check if the command.script contains "php -s" using the `in` keyword.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
def match(command):
    return "php -s" in command.script
```

With the above correction, the function should now work as expected and pass the provided test cases.
