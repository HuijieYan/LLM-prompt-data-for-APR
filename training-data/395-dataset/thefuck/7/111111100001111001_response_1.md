The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the command script contains the string "php -s". However, the current implementation of the function simply checks if "php -s" is present in the entire script, rather than at the beginning. This means it will return true for any command script that contains "php -s" anywhere in the script, regardless of whether it is at the beginning of the command.

To fix this, we need to modify the function to check if "php -s" is at the beginning of the script. We can use the `startswith` method to perform this check.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_7/thefuck/rules/php_s.py

# Corrected function
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return command.script.startswith("php -s ")
```

By using the `startswith` method, we ensure that the function only returns true if "php -s" is at the beginning of the command script, which aligns with the intended functionality of the function.
