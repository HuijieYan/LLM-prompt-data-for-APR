The buggy function is designed to check if the command contains the string "php -s". However, the implementation is incorrect as it directly checks if "php -s" is present in the entire command script, which may not always be the case.

To fix this, the function should check if "php -s" is present at the beginning of the command script, followed by either a space or the end of the script. This ensures that it correctly identifies commands of the form "php -s" without mistakenly matching other commands that contain "php -s" in the middle.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return command.script.startswith("php -s ") or command.script == "php -s"
```

This function now checks if the command script starts with "php -s " (followed by a space and additional characters) or if the command script is exactly "php -s". This should correctly identify the intended commands.
