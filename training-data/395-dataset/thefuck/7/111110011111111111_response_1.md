The bug occurs in the `match` function. This function checks if the string "php -s" is present in the `command.script` attribute. The bug is that it is using the `in` operator directly on the `command.script` string, which would match any occurrence of "php -s", not just the exact match.

To fix this, we need to modify the match function to check if the `command.script` exactly matches "php -s". This can be achieved using the equality (==) operator instead of the `in` operator.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return command.script == 'php -s'
```

This change will ensure that the function only returns True if the `command.script` attribute is exactly equal to "php -s", and False otherwise. This should resolve the issue reported in the error message.
