The error occurs because the `match` function is not correctly identifying whether the command includes "php -s". The `match` function checks if "php -s" is present in the `command.script`, but the test cases include commands that have additional parameters after "php -s". 

Potential Error: The `match` function may not be correctly checking for the presence of "php -s" in the command script due to the use of an exact string match.

Reason for the Bug: The `match` function is using the 'in' operator to check for an exact string match, which is causing it to return False for commands that include additional parameters after "php -s".

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug: Use regular expressions to accurately check if "php -s" is present in the command script without being affected by additional parameters.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
import re

@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return re.search(r'php -s\b', command.script) is not None
```

With this correction, the match function uses the `re.search` method to check if "php -s" is present with a word boundary (\b) to accurately match "php -s" as a separate command in the script.
