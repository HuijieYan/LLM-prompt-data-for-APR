The buggy function is attempting to check if the string "php -s" is present in the `command.script`. However, it's not handling the cases where other characters may be present before or after "php -s". 

The bug occurs because the function is using the `in` operator to do an exact string match, which is failing when there are additional characters before or after "php -s".

To fix this bug, we can use regular expressions to check if "php -s" is present in the script.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re

@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return re.search(r'php -s', command.script) is not None
```
