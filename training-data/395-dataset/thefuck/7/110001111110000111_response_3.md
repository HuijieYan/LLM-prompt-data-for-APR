The potential error in the problematic function is the condition in the `match` function. The current condition `return "php -s" in command.script` checks if the string "php -s" is present in the entire command script, including the arguments and options. This will lead to a false positive for commands like 'php -t pub -s 0.0.0.0:8080', where 'php -s' is not the actual command being executed.

To fix this issue, the condition should check if the first part of the command is 'php' and the second part is '-s'. We can split the command script by spaces and then perform this check.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    parts = command.script.split()
    return parts[0] == 'php' and parts[1] == '-s'
```

With this corrected condition, the function will accurately check whether the command script starts with 'php -s' as the intended command.
