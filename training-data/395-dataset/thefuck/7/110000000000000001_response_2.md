Potential Error Location: The 'match' function is using the '@for_app' decorator, which is not a standard Python decorator. This could be causing the error.

Reasons for the Bug:
1. The '@for_app' decorator is not a standard Python decorator and is likely causing a syntax error.
2. The 'match' function is not properly checking if the command contains "php -s".

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Remove the '@for_app' decorator as it is not a standard Python decorator.
2. Use a standard Python function syntax to define the 'match' function.

Corrected Code:
```python
def match(command):
    return "php -s" in command.script
```
