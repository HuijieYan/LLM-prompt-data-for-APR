The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the string "php -s" is present in the `command.script`. However, the current implementation is incorrect.

The error occurs because the `match` function is checking if the exact string "php -s" is present in the `command.script`, instead of checking if "php -s" is a part of the `command.script`.

To fix the bug, we need to use the `in` operator to check if "php -s" is present within the `command.script` string.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
# Corrected function
@for_app('php')
def match(command):
    return "php -s" in command.script
```
