Potential error location: The 'match' function is not correctly checking if the command contains 'ls' and does not contain 'ls -'.

Reason for bug: The 'match' function is incorrectly checking for the presence of 'ls' and 'ls -' in the command, which is leading to incorrect results for the test cases.

Approach for fixing the bug: Update the match function to correctly check for 'ls' in the command and then verify that 'ls -' is not in the command.

Corrected code for the 'match' function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return 'ls' in command.script and not ('ls -' in command.script)
```
