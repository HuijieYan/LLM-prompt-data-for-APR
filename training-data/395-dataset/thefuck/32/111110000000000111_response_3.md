Potential Error Location: The problem lies in the "match" function, which is intended to check if the command input contains "ls" but not "ls -".

Reason for the Bug: The current implementation of the "match" function only checks if "ls" is in the command script, but it does not exclude cases where "ls -" is present, which causes the function to return incorrect results.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
- Update the function to use a more precise check for "ls" without the presence of "ls -" in the command script.
- Use regular expressions to ensure that only "ls" without any following characters or options is matched.
- Consider capturing the entire command string and checking for "ls" separately instead of checking the entire script for "ls".

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:
```python
import re

def match(command, settings):
    return re.search(r'\bls\b(?![\s-])', command.script) is not None
```
