The potential error location within the problematic function is in the return statement:

```python
return 'ls' in command.script and not ('ls -' in command.script)
```

The bug occurs because the current return statement only checks if the string 'ls' is present in the command script and if the string 'ls -' is not present in the command script. This logic does not cover the case where the command script contains more characters after 'ls' and does not consider the space character.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the return statement to explicitly check if 'ls' is at the start of the command script without any other characters following it. We can also add a condition to check if 'ls' is followed by a space character. This way, we will correctly identify when the command is 'ls' and not 'ls -'.

Here is the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return command.script.startswith('ls') and (len(command.script) == 2 or command.script[2] == ' ')
```

With this correction, the function will now return the expected results for the given test cases.
