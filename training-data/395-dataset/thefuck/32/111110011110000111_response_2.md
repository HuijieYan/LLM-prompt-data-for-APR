The error occurs in the 'match' function where it incorrectly checks for the presence of 'ls -' in the command.script. This causes the assert statement in the test function to fail when it expects 'ls -lah /opt' not to match, but it does.

The potential error location is in the 'match' function, specifically in the line:
```python
return 'ls' in command.script and not ('ls -' in command.script)
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is incorrectly checking for the presence of 'ls -' in the command.script instead of checking for an exact match for 'ls -'. This leads to incorrect results when the test cases are executed.

To fix the bug, the function should check for an exact match for 'ls -' in the command.script, rather than just checking for its presence.

Here's the corrected code for the 'match' function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return 'ls' in command.script and not ('ls -' in command.script.split())
```

This correction splits the command.script into words and checks for the exact match for 'ls -' within the split words. This should fix the bug and make the test function pass as expected.
