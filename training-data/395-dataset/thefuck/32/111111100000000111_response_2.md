Potential error location:
The bug is likely occurring in the `match` function provided. The function is supposed to check if the command contains "ls" but does not contain "ls -". However, the function currently checks for 'ls' in `command.script` and then checks for 'ls -' in `command.script` without considering the order of occurrence.

Reasons behind the bug:
The current implementation of the `match` function does not accurately distinguish between the "ls" command and "ls -" command. This results in incorrect detection of the command and leads to unexpected behavior.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the match function should be updated to check for the presence of "ls" and also check that it is not followed by a hyphen ("-") immediately. This can be achieved by using regular expressions to match the command script against the pattern 'ls\s[^-]'.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import re

def match(command, settings):
    return re.search(r'ls\s[^-]', command.script) is not None
```

With the corrected code, the function will accurately detect if the command contains "ls" and is not followed by a hyphen, thereby fixing the bug.
