The issue with the provided function is that it is checking if 'ls' is in the command script but also checking if 'ls -' is not in the command script. This logic is problematic because it doesn't cover all the cases where 'ls' might appear in the command script.

The function is trying to match a command with specific criteria. However, the current implementation is flawed because it only checks for the presence of 'ls' in the command and the absence of 'ls -'. This doesn't cover cases where 'ls' might appear in the command along with other arguments or options.

To fix this, we need to modify the function to check for the exact match of 'ls' in the command script. This means we need to check if the command script starts with 'ls' and if it doesn't start with 'ls -'. This way, we cover all the cases where 'ls' might appear in the command script with or without additional arguments or options.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return command.script.startswith('ls ') and not command.script.startswith('ls -')
```
