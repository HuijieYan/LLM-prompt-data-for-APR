The test case is failing because the `match` function is returning True for the command `pacman -S binutils` even though it should not. This means that the bug is likely in the `match` function's condition for checking if 'ls -' is present in the command.

The bug is occurring because the condition 'ls -' in command.script is not correctly checking if the command starts with 'ls -'. Instead, it is checking if 'ls -' appears anywhere in the command.

To fix the bug, we need to update the condition to check if the command starts with 'ls -'. We can do this using the `startswith` method for strings.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return 'ls' in command.script and not command.script.startswith('ls -')
```

With this correction, the function will correctly check if the script starts with 'ls -' and return the expected results for the test cases.
