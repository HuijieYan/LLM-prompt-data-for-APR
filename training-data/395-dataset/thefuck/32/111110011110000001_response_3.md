The issue with the `match` function is that it checks for the presence of 'ls' in the command and then checks if 'ls -' is not present in the command. This approach is incorrect as it will always return True for commands like 'ls file.py' and 'ls /opt' since 'ls' is present and 'ls -' is not present in these commands. This causes the test case with 'pacman -S binutils' to fail, as it incorrectly returns True.

To fix the bug, the function should instead check if the command starts with 'ls' followed by a space, to ensure that it matches 'ls' as a standalone command and not as a part of another command.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return command.script.startswith('ls ')  # checks if the command script starts with 'ls '
```
