Potential error location: The problematic line of code in the function is `return 'ls' in command.script and not ('ls -' in command.script)`. 

Reasons for the bug: The current implementation only checks for the presence of 'ls' in the command.script and not the exact occurrence of 'ls' as a standalone command. Additionally, it does not check for the presence of 'ls -' in the command.script.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We need to modify the function to correctly check for the exact occurrence of 'ls' as a standalone command in the command.script and also check for the presence of 'ls -' in the command.script.

```python
# Corrected function
def match(command, settings):
    command_list = command.script.split()
    return 'ls' == command_list[0] and 'ls -' not in command.script
```
