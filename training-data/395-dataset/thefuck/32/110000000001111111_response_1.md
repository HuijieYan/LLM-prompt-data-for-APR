The buggy function `match` is intended to check if the command contains "ls" but not "ls -". However, the current implementation is flawed because it checks for the entire string "ls" in the command instead of just checking if "ls" is a separate command without any additional options.

The potential error is in the line
```python
return 'ls' in command.script and not ('ls -' in command.script)
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is using the 'in' keyword to check for the presence of "ls" in the command string, which may lead to false positives when "ls" is part of another command or argument.

To fix the bug, the function should be rewritten to use regular expressions to check for the presence of "ls" as a separate word in the command string.

Here's the corrected code:
```python
import re

def match(command, settings):
    return bool(re.search(r'\bls\b', command.script)) and not bool(re.search(r'\bls\s*-', command.script))
```

This code uses the `\b` word boundary to ensure that "ls" is matched as a separate word, and then checks if it is followed by a space and a hyphen. This should provide the correct check for the presence of the "ls" command without any additional options.
