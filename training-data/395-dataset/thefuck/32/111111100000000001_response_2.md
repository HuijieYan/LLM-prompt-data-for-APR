The potential error in the provided function is that it is not accurately checking for the 'ls -l' command. The current condition is only checking for 'ls' in the command.script and not 'ls -l'.

The bug occurs because the current code only checks for the presence of 'ls', but it does not specifically check for 'ls -l'.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to check for 'ls -l' in the command.script.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return 'ls' in command.script and '-l' in command.script
```
