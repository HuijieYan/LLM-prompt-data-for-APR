The bug occurs in the 'match' function where it checks for the presence of 'ls' in the command script and then checks for the absence of 'ls -' in the command script. The bug is causing the function to return True for the command 'pacman -S binutils' which is incorrect.

It seems that the bug is occurring because the condition 'ls' in command.script is evaluating to True for the command 'pacman -S binutils'.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition to specifically check for the exact occurrence of 'ls' as a separate command, and not as a part of another command like 'pacman'.

Here's the corrected code for the 'match' function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return command.script.startswith('ls ') and not ('ls -' in command.script)
```

This modified code checks if the command.script starts with 'ls ' and also checks for the absence of 'ls -' in the command script, thereby fixing the bug.
