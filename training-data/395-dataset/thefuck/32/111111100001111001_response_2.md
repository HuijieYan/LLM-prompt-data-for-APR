The buggy function is attempting to check if the command contains "ls" but not "ls -". However, the buggy function does not handle cases where there are additional arguments after "ls".

The bug occurs because the function is only checking if "ls" is present in the command, but it should also check if "ls" is at the beginning of the command.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to check if "ls" is at the beginning of the command, and if so, check if it is followed by a space or the end of the string.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return command.script.startswith('ls ') or command.script == 'ls'
```
