The buggy function is trying to match if the command contains 'ls' and does not contain 'ls -'. However, this logic is flawed because it only checks for the presence of 'ls -' in the command, which may not cover all cases where a flag is included with 'ls'.

The bug occurs because the function does not check if the command starts with 'ls -' and also does not account for other flags that might follow 'ls'.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to check if the command starts with 'ls -' and if it does not, then it can be considered a match.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return command.script.startswith('ls ') or command.script == 'ls'
```

This modified code checks if the command starts with 'ls ' (with a space following 'ls') or if the command is simply 'ls', which covers all cases where 'ls' is used with or without flags.
