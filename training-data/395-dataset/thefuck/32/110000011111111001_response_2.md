The error is occurring because the `match` function is not correctly identifying whether the command includes 'ls -' or not. The function only checks for `ls` in the command and then checks for the absence of `ls -`, which is incorrect for the test case `'pacman -S binutils'` because it will return `True` for the condition 'ls' in 'pacman -S binutils' and, as a result, the test fails.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `match` function to correctly identify the command.

Here is the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return command.script.startswith('ls ') and not command.script.startswith('ls -')
```

This code checks if the command starts with 'ls ' (including a space after 'ls') and does not start with 'ls -'. This correctly identifies the 'ls -' cases and resolves the issue with the failing test case.
