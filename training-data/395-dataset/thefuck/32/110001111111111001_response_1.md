The buggy function `match` is designed to check if the command has the word 'ls' in it but does not include 'ls -' in the command. This is verified by the test cases.

The error message indicates that the function returns `True` for the command `pacman -S binutils`, which is not the expected behavior.

The problem occurs because the function checks for 'ls' in the command without considering the position or any other characters following it. It only excludes commands starting with 'ls -'.

To fix this, the function should be modified to check if the command starts with 'ls' followed by a space or end of the line. This would accurately distinguish between 'ls' as a standalone command and 'ls' as part of a larger command.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
# Corrected function
def match(command, settings):
    return command.script.startswith('ls ') or command.script == 'ls'
```
