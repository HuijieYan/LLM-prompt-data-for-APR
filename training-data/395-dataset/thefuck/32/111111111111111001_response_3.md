The buggy function `match` is intended to check if the command string contains "ls" but does not contain "ls -". However, the function does not handle the case where "ls" is followed by other characters like in the input 'ls /opt'.

The bug occurs because the function only checks if the command contains 'ls' and does not check for 'ls -'. 

To fix the bug, we should modify the match function to use a regular expression that checks for the presence of 'ls' followed by optional whitespace and then a '-'.

The corrected code for the function is as follows:

```python
import re

def match(command, settings):
    return re.search(r'ls\s+-', command.script) is None
```

This fix will ensure that the function correctly identifies the commands that contain 'ls' without any options like '-l', '-a', or '-h'.
