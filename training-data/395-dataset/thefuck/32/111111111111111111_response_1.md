The issue seems to be with the `match` function. The function is supposed to check if the command contains 'ls' but does not contain 'ls -'. However, the implementation is incorrect, leading to failing test cases.

The reason behind the bug is that the current implementation checks for 'ls' but not 'ls -' separately. This means that if the command contains both 'ls' and 'ls -', the function will still return True, which is not the desired behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to check if the command starts with 'ls' but not 'ls -'. This will accurately distinguish between commands that contain 'ls' and 'ls -'.

Below is the corrected implementation of the `match` function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return command.script.startswith('ls') and not command.script.startswith('ls -')
```

This implementation uses the `startswith` method to check if the command starts with 'ls' but not 'ls -', which aligns with the intended behavior of the function.

With this corrected implementation, the test cases should pass without any assertion errors.
