The error message from the test function `test_match` indicates that the `match` function is not handling the command `pacman -S binutils` correctly. It should return False in this case, but it's currently returning True.

The potential error location within the `match` function is the conditional statement `'ls' in command.script`. It checks if the string 'ls' is present in the `command.script`. However, this condition does not account for the entirety of the command and is returning True for commands that contain 'ls' as a substring, such as 'lsof' or 'pacman -S binutils'.

The bug occurs because the current conditional statement only checks for the presence of 'ls' as a substring, leading to false positives for commands that contain 'ls' within them.

To fix the bug, the function needs to check if the entire command is equal to 'ls', rather than simply checking for the presence of 'ls' within the command.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return command.script == 'ls'
```

With this correction, the function checks if the entire script of the command is equal to 'ls', returning True only for direct 'ls' commands and False for commands containing 'ls' as a substring or other commands like 'pacman -S binutils'.
