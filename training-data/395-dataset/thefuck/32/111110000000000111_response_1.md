Potential error location:
The potential error is in the 'match' function, where it checks if 'ls' is in the command script and also checks if 'ls -' is not in the command script.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the function only checks for the presence of 'ls' in the command script, but it fails to check for the exact match of 'ls' as a standalone command. It also incorrectly checks for the absence of 'ls -' in the command script.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check for the exact match of the 'ls' command in the script.
2. Remove the incorrect check for 'ls -' in the command script.

Corrected code:
```python
def match(command, settings):
    return command.script.startswith('ls ') or command.script == 'ls'
```
