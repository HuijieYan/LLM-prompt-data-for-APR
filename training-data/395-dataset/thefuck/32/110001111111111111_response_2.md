The bug in the `match` function is that it returns true for the command "pacman -S binutils", which should not match the condition. The bug is likely occurring because the current implementation of the function checks only for the presence of "ls" in the command and the absence of "ls -" in the command. However, this logic is not sufficient to differentiate between "ls" and other commands like "pacman". 

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to explicitly check if the command starts with "ls " (ls followed by a space) and does not contain a hyphen after "ls ".

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return command.script.startswith('ls ') and not ('ls -' in command.script)
```

With this implementation, the function checks if the command starts with "ls " and does not contain "ls -", which should correctly match only the "ls" commands and not other commands like "pacman -S binutils".

This fix ensures that the function behaves according to the expected behavior and correctly differentiates between "ls" and other commands.
