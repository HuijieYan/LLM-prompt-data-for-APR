The buggy function is trying to check if the 'ls' command is present in the input command's script and if the input command's script does not contain 'ls -'. However, the current implementation is incorrect and does not accurately check for these conditions.

The issue seems to be with the 'in' and 'not in' conditions used in the return statement of the function. The function is incorrectly checking for 'ls' in command.script, which will return True even if 'ls' is part of another word, for example, 'also'. Similarly, the 'ls -' check is also incorrect as it only checks for the exact string 'ls -', but it should be checking for any occurrence of 'ls -' in the command's script.

To fix the bug, the function should check if the command's script starts with 'ls' and does not contain 'ls -'. This can be achieved using the startswith() method for string comparison.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return command.script.startswith('ls') and not ('ls -' in command.script)
```
