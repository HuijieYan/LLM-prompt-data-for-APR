The potential error in the provided function is in the condition 'ls -' in command.script. This condition is not checking whether the command contains the string 'ls -', but rather whether it is an exact match.

The function is intended to check if the command contains the string 'ls' and does not contain the exact sequence 'ls -'.

To fix the bug, we need to use the 'in' operator to check if 'ls' is present in the command script and also check if 'ls -' is not present in the command script.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return 'ls' in command.script and 'ls -' not in command.script
```
