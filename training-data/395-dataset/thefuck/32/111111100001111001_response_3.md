Potential error location: The buggy function is using the `startswith` method on the `command.script` string, but it should be using the `split` method to check for the presence of specific flags in the command.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the `startswith` method is checking for the presence of a specific string at the beginning of `command.script` instead of checking for specific flags within the command.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Use the `split` method to split the `command.script` string into individual words, and then check for specific flags within the command.
2. Use regular expressions to match specific patterns within the command string.

```python
import re

def match(command, settings):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    return 'ls' in split_command and not any(arg.startswith('-') for arg in split_command[1:])
```
