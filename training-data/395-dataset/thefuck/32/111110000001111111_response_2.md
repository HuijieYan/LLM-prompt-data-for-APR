The issue with the buggy function is that it is checking if the entire command contains 'ls' and does not contain 'ls -'. This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the position or the options used with the 'ls' command.

The bug occurs because the function is checking for the presence of 'ls' in the entire command string, and then checking for the absence of 'ls -' in the entire command string. This approach does not accurately determine if 'ls' is called without any options.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to check if 'ls' is at the beginning of the command and does not have any additional characters following it other than a space. This will accurately determine if 'ls' is being called without any options.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return command.script.startswith('ls ') and not ('ls -' in command.script)
```
