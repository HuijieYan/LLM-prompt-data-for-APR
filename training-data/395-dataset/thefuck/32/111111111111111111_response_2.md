Based on the given information, it appears that the `match` function is incorrectly returning `True` when it should be returning `False` for the input `Mock(script='pacman -S binutils')`. This suggests that the condition being checked in the `match` function is not accurately capturing the requirement, resulting in the erroneous behavior.

The bug occurs because the `match` function is erroneously returning `True` for the input `Mock(script='pacman -S binutils')` based on the current condition check of `ls in command.script and not ('ls -' in command.script)`. This condition doesn't fully capture the intended logic of the function, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, the condition in the `match` function can be modified to accurately capture the requirement, which is to identify cases where the command is "ls" but not "ls -" to determine a match. By simply checking for the presence of "ls" without a space or dash afterwards, the logic can be fixed.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return command.script == 'ls'
```

By updating the condition to explicitly check if the command script is exactly equal to 'ls', we ensure that the function returns `True` only when the command is 'ls' and not 'ls -' or variations thereof.

This fix will address the bug and ensure that the `match` function behaves as expected for all input cases, including the problematic input `Mock(script='pacman -S binutils')`.
