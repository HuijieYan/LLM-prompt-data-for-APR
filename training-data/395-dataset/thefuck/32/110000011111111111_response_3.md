The potential error location within the problematic function is the `match` function. The function checks if 'ls' is in the command script and ensures that 'ls -' is not in the command script, but it does not account for other commands.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function only checks for 'ls' and 'ls -' in the command script, but the test cases also include other commands like 'pacman -S binutils' and 'lsof'. As a result, the function returns incorrect results for these test cases.

To fix the bug, the `match` function needs to be updated to check for the presence of 'ls' in the command script and ensure that it is not followed by any other characters or arguments.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return command.script.startswith('ls ')
```

This updated function uses the `startswith` method to check if the command script starts with 'ls ' followed by a space. This handles all cases where the command is 'ls' with or without any additional arguments.
