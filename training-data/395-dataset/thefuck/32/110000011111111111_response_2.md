The bug occurs because the `match` function is checking if the string 'ls' is in the `command.script` and that 'ls -' is not in the `command.script`. This logic does not handle the case where 'ls' is followed by other characters.

To fix the bug, we need to check if 'ls' is at the start of the `command.script` and if there are no characters after 'ls' or there is a space.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return command.script.startswith('ls') and (len(command.script) == 2 or command.script[2] == ' ')
```
