Potential Error Location:
The potential error is in the condition 'ls -' in command.script. The intention is to check if the command entered is 'ls' and not 'ls -' but the logic is not correctly implemented.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The current implementation does not consider the case where 'ls' is followed by any other character after the space, such as 'ls -lah' or 'ls -l'. This can lead to incorrect matching of commands.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
We need to modify the condition to check if 'ls' is present in the command and it is not followed by any other character immediately. This can be done using regular expressions to match the exact sequence 'ls' without any additional characters.

Corrected Code:
```python
import re

def match(command, settings):
    return re.match(r'^ls\s*$', command.script) is not None
```
