The buggy function is attempting to determine if the command contains "ls" but not "ls -".

The potential error in the function is the use of `command.script`, which is not a valid attribute for the `command` object. It seems like the intention is to check the command string for "ls" and exclude "ls -".

The bug occurs because the `command` object does not have a `script` attribute. The correct way to access the command string is through `command.script_parts`.

To fix the bug, we need to use `command.script_parts` to access the command string and check for "ls" and exclude "ls -".

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return 'ls' in command.script_parts and not ('ls -' in command.script)
```
