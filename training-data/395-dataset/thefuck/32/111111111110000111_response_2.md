The error occurs because the `match` function is incorrectly checking for the presence of 'ls' in the command.script and then checking for the absence of 'ls -' in the command.script. This doesn't cover all cases where 'ls' could be in the command.

The potential error location is the condition `return 'ls' in command.script and not ('ls -' in command.script)`.

The bug occurs because the current condition only checks for the absence of 'ls -' in the command.script, which fails to cover cases where there might be additional arguments after 'ls'. It also doesn't cover cases where 'ls' is not directly followed by a space.

To fix this bug, one approach is to use regular expressions to match the command.script against the pattern `r'\bls\b(?! -)'` which looks for 'ls' as a whole word followed by any characters except a space and a hyphen.

```python
import re

def match(command, settings):
    return re.search(r'\bls\b(?! -)', command.script) is not None
```
