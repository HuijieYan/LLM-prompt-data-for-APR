The potential error location within the problematic function is the line:
```python
return 'ls' in command.script and not ('ls -' in command.script)
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the current implementation of the `match` function does not correctly distinguish between the command `ls` and `ls -lah`. It only checks for the presence of `ls` in the command and not for the specific flags `-lah`.

To fix the bug, the `match` function should be modified to explicitly check for the presence of the command `ls` and ensure that it is not followed by any additional flags.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    commands = command.script.split(' ')  # Split the command string into individual components
    
    return commands[0] == 'ls' and len(commands) == 1  # Check if the command is 'ls' and it has no additional flags
```

With this modification, the `match` function will now correctly check for the command `ls` without any following flags, addressing the bug.
