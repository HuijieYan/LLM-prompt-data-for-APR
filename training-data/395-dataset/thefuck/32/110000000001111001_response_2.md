The buggy function has an issue with the condition in the return statement. The current condition checks if 'ls' is in the command.script and if 'ls -' is not in the command.script. However, this condition does not accurately match the expected behavior, as it does not properly handle the different cases and arguments for the 'ls' command.

The error occurs because the function is using an incorrect condition to check for the presence of 'ls' in the command script, which may lead to incorrect results or unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition to accurately check for the 'ls' command in the script, and also correctly handle the presence of arguments.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return command.script.startswith("ls ") or command.script == "ls"
```

In this corrected function, we use the `startswith()` method to check if the command script starts with "ls ", which covers cases where there are arguments after "ls". Additionally, we also check if the command script is exactly "ls" to cover the case where there are no arguments after "ls". This ensures that the function accurately identifies the 'ls' command in the script.
