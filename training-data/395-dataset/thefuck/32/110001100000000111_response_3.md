Potential Error Location:
The potential error is in the match function, particularly in the condition 'ls' in command.script and not ('ls -' in command.script). This condition is not checking for the 'ls -' command properly.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The condition 'ls' in command.script will return true for the command 'ls -lah -S binutils' in the provided test case. However, the 'ls -' condition is not properly excluding commands with 'ls -' in them, leading to the incorrect matching of the command.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the condition for excluding commands with 'ls -' should be updated to properly check for command patterns such as 'ls -'.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def match(command, settings):
    return 'ls' in command.script and not (command.script.startswith('ls -'))
```
