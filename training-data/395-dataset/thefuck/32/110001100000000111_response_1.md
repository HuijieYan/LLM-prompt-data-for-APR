The bug in the provided function is that it's checking for 'ls' in the command without considering the presence of other arguments. This causes the function to return True for commands like 'ls -lah -S binutils', which is incorrect.

The reason for the bug is that the function only checks for 'ls' in the command script but doesn't consider the possibility of other arguments being present.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to check for the exact match of 'ls' in the command script and also ensure that there are no other characters or arguments appended to it.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    parts = command.script_parts
    return parts[0] == 'ls' and len(parts) == 1
```

This corrected function checks if the first part of the command script is 'ls' and also verifies that there are no other parts/arguments present in the script.
