The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command 'ls' is present in the input `command.script` and if the command 'ls -' is not present. However, the current implementation is incorrect as it uses the `in` operator without checking for the exact match of 'ls' and 'ls -'.

The potential error location is in the return statement of the `match` function.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the current implementation does not accurately check for the presence of the exact command 'ls' and the absence of the command 'ls -'.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the return statement to accurately check for the conditions specified.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return command.script == 'ls' and not command.script.startswith('ls -')
``` 

This corrected function checks for the exact match of 'ls' in the `command.script` and ensures that it does not start with 'ls -'. This accurately implements the intended logic of the `match` function.
