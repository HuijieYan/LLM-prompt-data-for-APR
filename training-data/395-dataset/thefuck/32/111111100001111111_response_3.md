The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command includes 'ls' but not 'ls -'. However, the condition `not ('ls -' in command.script)` is not enough to exclude commands like 'ls -lah /opt' from matching.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition `not ('ls -' in command.script)`, which is not excluding commands with options after 'ls'.

The bug occurs because the current condition only checks for the presence of 'ls -' in the command.script, but it should also consider whether there are any other characters after 'ls -'.

To fix the bug, we need to improve the condition to exclude commands with options after 'ls', such as 'ls -lah /opt'.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return 'ls' in command.script and not command.script.startswith('ls -')
```
