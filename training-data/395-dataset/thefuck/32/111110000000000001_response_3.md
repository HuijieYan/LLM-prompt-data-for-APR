Potential error location: 
The issue lies in the condition 'ls' in command.script. This condition checks if 'ls' is present in the command.script, but it doesn't necessarily check if 'ls' is the exact command.

Reason behind the bug:
The current condition does not accurately check if the command is 'ls' but also the possibility of 'ls' being part of another command (e.g., 'lsc' or 'lso').

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use regular expressions to check for the exact 'ls' command.
2. Check if the command is exactly equal to 'ls' to ensure it is the intended command.

Corrected code:
```python
import re

def match(command, settings):
    return re.match(r'^ls$', command.script) is not None
```
In the corrected code, we use the re.match() function to check if the command.script exactly matches 'ls'. This ensures that we are checking for the exact 'ls' command and not a partial match.
