Potential error location: The condition 'not ('ls -' in command.script)' is problematic as it checks for the presence of 'ls -' in the command.script, which doesn't cover all possible cases. 

Reason for the bug: The current condition does not adequately check for the presence of 'ls -' in the command.script, leading to incorrect results.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We need to modify the condition to accurately check for the presence of 'ls -' in the command.script.

Corrected code:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return 'ls' in command.script and not any(arg.startswith('-') for arg in command.script.split()[1:])
```
In the corrected code, the condition uses the split() function to separate the individual arguments in the command.script and then checks if any argument starts with '-'. This accurately determines if 'ls -' is present in the command.script.
