The buggy function is attempting to match a command with a specific pattern, but the condition 'ls' in command.script is not checking for the exact occurrence of the command. It will also return true for commands like "lsp" or "als" which contain 'ls'. 

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return command.script.startswith('ls ') and not command.script.startswith('ls -')
```

In the corrected function, we are using the `startswith` method to check if the command starts with 'ls ' and is not starting with 'ls -'. This ensures that we match only the 'ls' command without any flags.
