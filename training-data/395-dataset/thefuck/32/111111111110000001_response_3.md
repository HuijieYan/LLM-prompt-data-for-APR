The error is occurring because the `match` function is not correctly identifying the presence of 'ls' in the command script. The current implementation only checks for the presence of 'ls' and not 'ls -'.

To fix this bug, the condition in the `match` function needs to be adjusted so that it correctly identifies both 'ls' and 'ls -'.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return command.script.startswith('ls') and not command.script.startswith('ls -')
```

This implementation uses the `startswith` method to check if the script starts with 'ls' and does not start with 'ls -', which correctly identifies the 'ls -' command as an exception.
