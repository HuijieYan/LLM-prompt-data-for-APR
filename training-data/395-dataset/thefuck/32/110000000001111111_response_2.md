The function `match` is intended to check if the command contains "ls" but not "ls -". However, the current implementation only checks if "ls" is in the command and doesn't check for the exact match.

The bug occurs because the current implementation does not ensure that "ls" is a standalone command and not part of another command, such as "lsof" or "pacman -S binutils".

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to check for the exact match of "ls" in the command.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
def match(command, settings):
    return command.script == 'ls'
```

This implementation checks if the command.script is exactly equal to 'ls', ensuring that it is a standalone "ls" command.
