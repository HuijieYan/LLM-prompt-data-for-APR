The error is occurring because in the buggy function, the pop() method is being called twice on the same index 'upstream_option_index'. This is causing an IndexError when the second pop() is called because the list length has already been reduced by the first pop().

The buggy function is designed to remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option and its argument from the command, and then replace the 'push' argument with the actual push command suggested by git. However, the original function has a bug. When the '-u' option is present in the command, the index of '-u' is found and stored in 'upstream_option_index'. Then, even if '-u' is not present and '--set-upstream' is present, the index of '--set-upstream' is stored in the same 'upstream_option_index' variable, overwriting the index of '-u'. This leads to the removal of the wrong argument from the 'command.script_parts' list.

The possible approach to fix the bug is to store the indices of both '--set-upstream' and '-u' separately, and then use an if-else condition to prioritize the removal of '--set-upstream' over '-u' if both are present in the list.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    try:
        upstream_option_index_u = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index_u = -1
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    elif upstream_option_index_u != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index_u)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index_u)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
