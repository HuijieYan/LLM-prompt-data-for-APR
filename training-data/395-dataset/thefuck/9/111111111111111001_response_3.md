The error message indicates that an IndexError occurred at line 27 in the buggy function `get_new_command`. The problematic line is `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)`.

The bug occurs because the pop function is called twice, which removes the same index from the list `command.script_parts` when the `upstream_option_index` is not equal to -1. This leads to an `IndexError` when trying to pop the same index again from the list, resulting in "pop index out of range" error.

To fix the bug, we should only call the `pop` function when the `upstream_option_index` is not equal to -1. 

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.types import Command

# corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git,
    # which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:  # check if not equal to -1
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the element at upstream_option_index
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the element at upstream_option_index again

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By making these changes, the function should now work as expected and address the issues identified in the error message.
