The bug in this function is that it doesn't properly handle the case when the option '--set-upstream' or '-u' is not found in the `command.script_parts`. This causes the function to throw an error and not handle these cases properly.

To fix this bug, we can add a check to see if the `upstream_option_index` is not -1 before trying to remove the element at that index in the list.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Buggy function source code
# this is the buggy function you need to fix
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:  # Check if the upstream_option_index is not -1
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this change, the function will handle all cases properly and avoid throwing errors.
