The bug in the provided function is that it attempts to access `command.stderr.split('\n')[-3]` to extract the output. However, the position of the error message in the `stderr` output is not always consistent, which causes the function to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to find a more reliable way to extract the `push_upstream` value from the `stderr` output.

We can fix the function by using regular expressions to extract the `push_upstream` value.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git,
    # which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    # Using regular expression to extract the push_upstream value from the stderr output
    match = re.search(r'git push (.+)', command.stderr)
    if match:
        push_upstream = match.group(1)
    else:
        push_upstream = ''

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code uses a regular expression to extract the push_upstream value from the stderr output, which should be more reliable than relying on the position of the error message in the output.
