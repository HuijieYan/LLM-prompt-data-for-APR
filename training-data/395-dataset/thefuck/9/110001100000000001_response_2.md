Potential error location: 
The potential error is within the try-except blocks where the `upstream_option_index` is assigned. If the first try block fails to find '--set-upstream', the second try block will override the value of `upstream_option_index`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the second try block does not have a conditional check based on the value of `upstream_option_index` and will always execute, regardless of whether the first try block was successful or not.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use separate conditional statements for the try-except blocks to handle the cases when either '--set-upstream' or '-u' is not found.
2. Use a single try-except block and handle both cases within it.

Corrected code:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    if upstream_option_index == -1:  # Add a conditional check
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1:  # Add a conditional check
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
