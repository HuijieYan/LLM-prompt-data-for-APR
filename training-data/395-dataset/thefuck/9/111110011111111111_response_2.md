The error is occurring because the 'upstream_option_index' variable is being set to the index of '-u' even if '--set-upstream' is present in the list, which leads to index out of range error when trying to pop the element at that index.

The buggy function is attempting to find the index of '--set-upstream' and '-u' in the `command.script_parts` list, and then popping the elements at those indices. However, it doesn't handle the case where both '--set-upstream' and '-u' are present in the list simultaneously, and so popping one of them will result in an IndexError when trying to pop the other one.

To fix the bug, you can check for both '--set-upstream' and '-u' separately and then remove both occurrences if present. Here's the corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove them and their arguments.
    # This is because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested by git,
    # which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('push') + 1
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument for --set-upstream
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('push') + 1
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument for -u

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This correction will properly handle both '--set-upstream' and '-u' options, and remove them and their arguments from the command script parts when present.

After making this correction, the issue with popping index out of range should be resolved.
