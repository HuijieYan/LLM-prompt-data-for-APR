The buggy function is designed to identify and remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option from the command, and then construct a new command by replacing the 'push' argument with the argument obtained from the git command's error message. 

The bug occurs because in the buggy function, the second try-except block overwrites the value of 'upstream_option_index' obtained in the first try-except block. As a result, the '--set-upstream' argument is not removed in some cases, leading to incorrect behavior.

To fix this bug, you can use logical OR (||) to set the 'upstream_option_index' value only if it is not already set. By doing so, the value obtained in the first try-except block will not be overwritten by the value obtained in the second try-except block.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index == -1:
        try:
            if '-u' in command.script_parts:
                upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
