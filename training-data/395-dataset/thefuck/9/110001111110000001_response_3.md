The potential error lies in the `get_new_command` function of the `git_push.py` file. The `IndexError: pop index out of range` occurs when trying to pop an element from `command.script_parts`. This suggests that the index being used to pop the element is out of range, meaning it does not exist in the list.

The reason behind this bug is that the code does not handle the case where the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is not present in the command script. The error handling is also not implemented correctly because if the `-u` option is not found, the function should proceed to the next handler, but currently, it will just execute the second pop command, leading to an index out of range error.

To fix this bug, error handling should be improved to check if the index of `-u` or `--set-upstream` exists before attempting to pop them from the list. Additionally, the correct push upstream should be extracted from the last line of `stderr` using a more robust method.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].split()[-1]  # Extract the last argument from the third-to-last line
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
