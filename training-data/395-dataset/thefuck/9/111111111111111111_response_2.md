## 1. Analysis
The error message indicates an "IndexError: pop index out of range" when calling the `get_new_command` function with the `Command('git push -u', stderr=stderr)` input. This suggests that the pop operation is attempting to remove an index that is out of range, causing the error.

## 2. Potential Error Location
The potential error location is within the block of code that tries to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the `command.script_parts` list.

## 3. Reasons for the Bug
The bug occurs because if the `-u` option is found, it is immediately removed from `command.script_parts`, which shifts the index position of the subsequent element. However, after the removal of `-u`, the subsequent removal operation tries to remove the same index, which is now referencing a different element.

## 4. Possible Approaches
To fix this bug, the approach would be to check and remove both the `--set-upstream` and `-u` options separately without immediately removing each one. Once both options are checked and marked for removal, they can be removed from the list in a single operation to avoid shifting the index position.

## 5. Corrected Code
```python
# Corrected get_new_command function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, mark them for removal
    remove_options = []
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        remove_options.append(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        remove_options.append(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    # Remove marked options from the script parts
    for index in remove_options:
        command.script_parts.pop(index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the `--set-upstream` and `-u` options are identified and marked for removal first and then removed in a single operation to avoid shifting the index position and causing the IndexError. This should resolve the bug in the `get_new_command` function.
