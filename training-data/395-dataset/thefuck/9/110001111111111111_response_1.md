The error occurs in the buggy function when the `upstream_option_index` is not found in the `command.script_parts` list and then `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` is called, causing an IndexError. This happens when the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is not present in the `command.script_parts` list.

The reason behind the bug is that the code attempts to retrieve the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` without first checking if it exists in the list. This causes an IndexError when attempting to pop an element from the list that does not exist.

To fix the bug, we should first check if `--set-upstream` or `-u` exists in the `command.script_parts` list before trying to retrieve its index and pop the elements. If it does not exist, we can avoid popping the elements.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected code, the function will first check if `--set-upstream` or `-u` exists in the `command.script_parts` list. If it does, it will retrieve the index and pop the elements. If not, it will skip popping the elements and proceed to the next steps.
