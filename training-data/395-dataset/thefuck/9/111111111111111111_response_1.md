The buggy function is supposed to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option and its argument from the `git push` command and replace it with the actual suggestion provided by Git. However, the buggy function is mistakenly trying to remove the same index twice, which causes an `IndexError`.

To fix this bug, we should first find the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` and then remove it once.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # Get the push suggestion from the stderr
        push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        # Replace 'push' with the actual suggestion
        command.script_parts[0] = push_upstream.split()[0]
        return ' '.join(command.script_parts) + ' ' + ' '.join(push_upstream.split()[1:])
    else:
        return " ".join(command.script_parts)
```

With this correction, the function finds the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u`, removes it from the `command.script_parts` list, and then constructs the new command using the actual suggestion provided by Git.
