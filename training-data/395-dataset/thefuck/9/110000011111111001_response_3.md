The error is occurring in the `get_new_command` function, specifically in the following block of code:

```python
if upstream_option_index is not -1:
    command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
```

The error message indicates that an IndexError is being raised when trying to pop an element from `command.script_parts` using the index `upstream_option_index`. The reason for this error is that the second pop operation is using the same index that was used for the first pop operation. This causes the index to go out of range after the first item is removed from the list.

To fix this issue, we need to adjust the code to ensure that the second pop operation removes the correct element. We can do this by subtracting 1 from the index before performing the second pop operation.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        upstream_option_index -= 1  # Adjust the index
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
