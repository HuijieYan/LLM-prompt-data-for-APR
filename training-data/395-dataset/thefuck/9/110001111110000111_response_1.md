The test case is for the `get_new_command` function, which takes a `Command` object as input and returns a modified command string. The function is expected to parse the stderr and modify the command accordingly.

The error message indicates an `IndexError` at line 27 of `git_push.py`, specifically in the `pop` operation of the `command.script_parts`. This suggests that the `upstream_option_index` was not correctly determined, leading to an out-of-range index error when trying to remove elements from the list.

The bug occurs because the `upstream_option_index` is not being correctly updated. The second `try` block overwrites the value set by the first `try` block, resulting in incorrect indexing. Additionally, the condition `if upstream_option_index is not -1` is not correctly evaluating the variable.

To fix the bug, the function should properly handle the case when the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are found in the command. The indexing operations should be within separate `if` blocks and the condition should use `!=` for comparison rather than `is not`. Also, missing import statements for `Command` and `replace_argument` need to be handled in the provided code.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from thefuck.shells import git_support, replace_argument
from thefuck.types import Command

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
