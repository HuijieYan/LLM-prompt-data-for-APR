The error message indicates an "IndexError: pop index out of range" in the get_new_command function. This occurs because the function is trying to pop an item from the command.script_parts without checking if the index exists. This happens when the "git push -u" command is passed as an argument. The function attempts to pop an index that does not exist due to the "-u" argument not being present.

To fix this issue, the function needs to handle both the "--set-upstream" and "-u" cases separately and check if the index that needs to be popped exists before attempting to pop it.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass

    if upstream_option_index != -1 and len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index + 1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
