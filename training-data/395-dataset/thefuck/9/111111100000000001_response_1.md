Potential Error Location: 
The potential error is in the logic for finding the index of the upstream option ("-u" or "--set-upstream") in the command script parts.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because the code does not correctly handle the case where both "-u" and "--set-upstream" options are present in the command.script_parts. It also incorrectly removes the next argument after removing the upstream option.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use the "in" keyword to check if either "-u" or "--set-upstream" is present in the command.script_parts instead of using multiple try-except blocks.
2. After removing the upstream option and its argument, update the command.script_parts index to ensure that the correct elements are removed.

Corrected Code:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove the argument
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
