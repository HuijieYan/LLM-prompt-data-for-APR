The error occurs on line 32 of the `git_support` function, where `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)` is called twice. The bug occurs because the `upstream_option_index` is being used twice to pop the same element from `command.script_parts`.

The bug occurs because if `-u` is present in the `command.script_parts`, it will overwrite the value of `upstream_option_index` that was previously set when `--set-upstream` was checked. This results in only the second index being popped from `command.script_parts`, which is why an IndexError occurs.

To fix this bug, the function should properly identify the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` and remove it once, without overwriting the index.

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_options = ['--set-upstream', '-u']
    for option in upstream_options:
        if option in command.script_parts:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
            if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
                command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
