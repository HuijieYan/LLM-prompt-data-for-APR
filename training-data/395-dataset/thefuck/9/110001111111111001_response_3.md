The error occurs because the buggy function is trying to remove the same index from the list `command.script_parts` twice, which results in an IndexError when the index becomes out of range.

The bug occurs because the function is not checking whether the `-u` option exists in the `command.script_parts` list before trying to remove it. This means that if `-u` is not present, the function will still attempt to remove it, causing an IndexError.

To fix this bug, the function should check if the `-u` option exists in the list before attempting to remove it. If it does not exist, the function should not perform any removal operations.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # remove it again to account for the argument

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code checks for the existence of `--set-upstream` and `-u` in the `command.script_parts` list before attempting to remove them, preventing any IndexError from occurring.
