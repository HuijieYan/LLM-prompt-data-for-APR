Potential error location: 
The error seems to occur in the `get_new_command` function at the line `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)`.

Reasons behind the bug:
The bug occurs because the code tries to pop the same index from `command.script_parts` twice. The second call to pop will result in an IndexError because the list will be empty after the first pop operation.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
Instead of using two separate try-except blocks to find the index of '--set-upstream' and '-u', the code can be refactored to use a single try-except block and use the `in` operator to check if either '--set-upstream' or '-u' is present in the `command.script_parts`. Then, the code should use the index of the found option to remove it from the list.

Corrected code:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        except ValueError:
            pass
    else:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
In the corrected code, the if-else block is used to first check for '--set-upstream' and then for '-u', and the index of the option is used to remove it from the list only once.
