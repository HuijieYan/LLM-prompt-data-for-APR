The error is caused by the attempt to pop an element from the `command.script_parts` list at the same index twice. This leads to an IndexError when the index is out of range, as seen in the error message.

The bug occurs because the code attempts to pop the element at `upstream_option_index` twice, regardless of whether the index is valid. This causes an issue when the index is -1, as the code still tries to pop the element at that index.

To fix the bug, we should ensure that the index is valid before attempting to pop the element from the list. We can achieve this by using an if statement to check if the index is greater than or equal to 0 before popping the element.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index >= 0:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # After removing the upstream option, we still need to remove its argument
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this change, the code will only attempt to pop the element from the list if the index is valid, avoiding the IndexError that occurred previously.
