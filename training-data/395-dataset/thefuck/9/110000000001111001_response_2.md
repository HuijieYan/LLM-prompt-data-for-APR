Based on the given code and test cases, it seems that the buggy function is trying to modify the command script by removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' flags and their corresponding arguments, and then replacing the 'push' command with the push_upstream variable value.

The buggy function seems to have a logic issue:
1. The logic to find the index of '--set-upstream' or '-u' is not correct. It is currently removing the flag and its argument incorrectly.
2. The push_upstream variable is extracted from the command.stderr, but it should only include the 'origin master' part after '--set-upstream'.

The potential issues are:
- The logic to find the index of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' flag may not be correctly implemented, leading to incorrect removal.
- The push_upstream variable is extracted incorrectly, and only the relevant part needs to be extracted from command.stderr.

To fix the issues, the function could be modified as follows:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove '--set-upstream' or '-u' and its argument
    command.script_parts = [part for part in command.script_parts if part not in ('--set-upstream', '-u')]

    # Extract the push_upstream value correctly from command.stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].split('--set-upstream ')[-1]

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This code addresses the issues by correctly removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' flags and their arguments from command.script_parts. It also extracts the push_upstream value from command.stderr correctly by splitting and extracting the relevant part.
