The error in the function lies in the handling of the upstream_option_index. The function tries to find the index of '--set-upstream' and '-u' in the command.script_parts list, but it doesn't handle the case where both options are present or handle the possibility of them not being present at all.

The bug occurs because the function expects only one of '--set-upstream' or '-u' to be present, and it doesn't account for the possibility of both or none of them being present. This causes issues with the pop operation and leads to incorrect slicing of the command's script parts.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for finding the index of '--set-upstream' or '-u' and properly handle the cases where both or none of them are present. Additionally, we should handle the case where the command.stderr is not in the expected format or doesn't contain the required information.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Find the index of '--set-upstream' or '-u' in the script parts
    upstream_option_index = None
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        if option in command.script_parts:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            break

    # If the index was found, remove the option and its argument
    if upstream_option_index is not None:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    # Handle the case where the split command.stderr doesn't contain the expected information
    try:
        push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    except (IndexError, AttributeError):
        push_upstream = ''

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With these changes, the function should correctly handle the presence of '--set-upstream' or '-u' in the command, as well as handle the case where the command.stderr doesn't contain the expected information.
