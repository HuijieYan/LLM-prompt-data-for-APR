Potential error location: 
The issue is with the use of an undefined variable 'shells' and a missing import statement for this module. Additionally, the logic for constructing the new command needs to be updated as it is not handling all cases correctly.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The 'shells' module is not imported and is being used within the function, causing a NameError.
2. The function uses an incorrect logic for constructing the new command, especially handling the 'vagrant up' command addition.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Import the 'shells' module if it is required for the function.
2. Modify the logic for constructing the new command to handle all cases correctly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    if machine:
        return "vagrant up " + machine + " && " + command.script
    else:
        return command.script
```
