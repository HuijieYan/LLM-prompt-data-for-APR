The issue with the given function is that the 'shells.and_' method is not a standard Python method and is likely causing the error. Additionally, the function is incorrectly constructing the new command by concatenating strings, which is not the correct approach.

To fix this, the function should construct the new command using Python's string manipulation methods. It should also handle cases where the length of the 'cmds' list is less than 3 to avoid index out of range errors.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    new_command = "vagrant up " + machine
    if len(cmds) > 1:
        new_command += " && " + command.script
    return new_command
```
