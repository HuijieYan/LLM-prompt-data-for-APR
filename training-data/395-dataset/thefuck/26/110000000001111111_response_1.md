The potential error location within the given function is the use of an undefined variable `shells` inside the function, which isn't present or imported anywhere in the code snippet. Additionally, the function doesn't handle the scenario where the length of `cmds` is less than 3, leading to potential index out of range errors.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is the use of an undefined `shells` variable.

To fix the bug:
1. Import the required module, class, or function if `shells` is a predefined object.
2. Add a condition to handle the scenario where the length of `cmds` is less than 3 to avoid index out of range errors.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""  # assuming machine should be an empty string if cmds length < 3
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    return "vagrant up " +  machine + " && " + command.script
```
