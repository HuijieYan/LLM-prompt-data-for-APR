The problem lies in the `get_new_command` function. The main issue is that the `shells.and_` function is being used instead of the `subprocess` module to execute the required commands. This is leading to the incorrect construction of the new command.

The reason for the bug is that the function `shells.and_` is not a valid function for executing shell commands. It seems like the original intention was to use `subprocess` to execute shell commands and concatenate them with '&&'.

To fix the bug, we should use the `subprocess` module to execute the shell commands and concatenate them using '&&'. We should not import `shells` and directly use `subprocess` to achieve the desired behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import subprocess

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    command_to_execute = "vagrant up"  # Always perform 'vagrant up' before any other command
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
        command_to_execute += " && " + "vagrant " + ' '.join(cmds[1:])
    else:
        machine = ""
        command_to_execute += " && " + command.script

    return command_to_execute
```
