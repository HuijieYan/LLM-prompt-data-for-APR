The error is occurring because the function `get_new_command` is not handling the case where `cmds` is empty. This is causing the function to return incorrect values when `machine` is used in the return statement.

The bug occurs because the function does not check the length of `cmds` before accessing `cmds[2]` to get the `machine`. When the input parameter `command.script` is of the form "vagrant ssh" or "vagrant rdp", the `cmds` list contains only one element, so attempting to access `cmds[2]` causes an `IndexError`.

To fix the bug, the function needs to check the length of `cmds` before accessing specific indices within it.

Here is the corrected function `get_new_command`:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    new_command = "vagrant up " + machine
    return new_command
```
