Potential Error Location: The potential error location is in the return statement of the get_new_command function, where it is attempting to concatenate "vagrant up " with the machine variable.

Reason for the Bug:
1. The code does not handle cases where the command does not contain at least three words, which leads to an "IndexError" when trying to access cmds[2].
2. The code also has an incorrect reference to shells.and_ instead of using the correct syntax for string concatenation.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the length of the cmds list before accessing cmds[2] to avoid IndexError.
2. Use the correct syntax for string concatenation.

Corrected Code:
```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    return "vagrant up " + machine
```
