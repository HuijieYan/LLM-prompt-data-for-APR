Potential error location: The problem is within the `get_new_command` function. It is trying to split the command using the `command.script.split(' ')`, but it should be accessing `script` attribute directly without the need for split.

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs because the `command` parameter is expected to have a `script` attribute, but instead of directly accessing the `script` attribute, the code tries to split the `command.script` attribute.

Suggestions to fix the bug: Access the `script` attribute directly without the need for splitting.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    machine = ""
    if len(command.script.split(' ')) >= 3:
        machine = command.script.split(' ')[2]
    return f"vagrant up {machine} && {command.script}"

```
