The potential error in the code is that the function attempts to access the `script` attribute of the `command` input parameter using `command.script`, but it should be accessed using `command` only. Additionally, the function is attempting to call a method `and_` on the variable `shells`, which is not defined anywhere in the code. It seems like the intent is to concatenate the strings "vagrant up" and `machine` with the input `command.script`. 

In all the buggy cases, the function fails to extract the correct `machine` from the `command.script`. Instead, it tries to access the elements of `cmds` without properly checking the length of the list before doing so. This results in incorrect concatenation of the command strings.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to properly extract the machine name and then concatenate the strings accordingly.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    return "vagrant up " +  machine + " && " + command
```
