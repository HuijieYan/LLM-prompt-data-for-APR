The problematic function `get_new_command` has a bug that causes it to return incorrect values, leading to failed test cases.

The bug in the code stems from the misinterpretation of the input `command`, specifically the `script` attribute. The function attempts to split the `script` attribute of the `Command` object using the space character, which may not yield the expected number of elements. This causes an index out of range error when the function tries to access `cmds[2]`.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to handle different scenarios based on the input `command`. Specifically, we need to check for the presence of arguments in the `script` and construct the new command accordingly.

Here is the corrected and refactored function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    old_command = command.script
    if 'VM must be running to open SSH connection' in command.stderr:
        machine = old_command.split()[-1]
        return f'vagrant up {machine} && {old_command}'
    elif 'VM must be created before running this command' in command.stderr:
        return f'vagrant up && {old_command}'
    else:
        return old_command
```

The updated function checks the `stderr` of the `command` object and constructs the new command based on the specific error message presented. It extracts the required information and creates the correct new command accordingly.

After applying this fix, the function should handle the different scenarios described in the test cases and return the expected new command values.
