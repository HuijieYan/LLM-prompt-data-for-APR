The potential error in the code is with the `shells.and_` function, which does not seem to be a standard Python function. It seems like the intended function was to concatenate the string "vagrant up " with the value of `machine`.

The bug occurs because the machine variable is not being properly inserted into the command to be executed. Instead, the buggy code attempts to use the `shells.and_` function which is not a standard Python function and has not been defined within the provided code.

To fix the bug, we need to concatenate the "vagrant up " with the value of `machine` and return the concatenated string as the new command.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    return "vagrant up " +  machine
```
