The potential error in the code is the incorrect use of the `shells.and_` method. It seems like the implementation of `shells.and_` is not compatible with the concatenation of strings and requires a different approach.

The error occurs because the `shells.and_` method is not correctly handling the concatenation of strings in the original code. It was attempting to concatenate the two strings 'vagrant up ' and 'machine' with an '&&' operator. However, this operation did not produce the expected result due to the misuse of the `shells.and_` method.

To fix the bug, a new approach is required. Instead of using `shells.and_`, a simple string concatenation using the `+` operator should be sufficient for combining the commands as intended.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    return "vagrant up " + machine + " && " + command.script
```
