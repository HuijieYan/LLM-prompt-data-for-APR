The bug is likely to be in the `get_new_command` function. It is not correctly constructing the new command as expected by the test cases.

The buggy function `get_new_command` splits the input command string by space and tries to extract a substring. It then appends "vagrant up" to that substring. However, the logic to handle different scenarios (such as `vagrant ssh` and `vagrant rdp`) is missing. Additionally, the usage of `shells.and_` is incorrect, which is probably leading to the incorrect result.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle the different scenarios with if-else conditions and use string concatenation to build the correct command.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if "ssh" in command.script:
        machine = command.script.replace('vagrant ssh', '').strip()
        return f"vagrant up {' '.join(machine.split())} && vagrant ssh"
    elif "rdp" in command.script:
        machine = command.script.replace('vagrant rdp', '').strip()
        return f"vagrant up {' '.join(machine.split())} && vagrant rdp"
```

This code handles the different scenarios for 'ssh' and 'rdp' commands and constructs the new command accordingly.
