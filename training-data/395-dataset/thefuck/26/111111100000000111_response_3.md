Potential error location: 
The error occurs at the line "return shells.and_("vagrant up " +  machine, command.script)" where "shells.and_" is not defined and there is also an issue with concatenating strings.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: 
The function "shells.and_" is not defined and the code also tries to concatenate strings incorrectly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Use the correct method for string concatenation.
2. Use the correct method for executing the command "vagrant up".

Corrected code:
```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    return "vagrant up " + machine
```
