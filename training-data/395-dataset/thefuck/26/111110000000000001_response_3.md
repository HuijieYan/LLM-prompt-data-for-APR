Potential error location: The line "machine = cmds[2]" may cause an error if the command.script does not contain at least 3 words separated by spaces.

Reason for the bug: The code assumes that the command.script always contains at least 3 words, which may not be the case.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Check the length of the cmds list before accessing index 2 to ensure it contains enough elements to avoid IndexError.

Corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
        return shells.and_("vagrant up " +  machine, command.script)
    else:
        return "Error: Not enough arguments in the command"
```
