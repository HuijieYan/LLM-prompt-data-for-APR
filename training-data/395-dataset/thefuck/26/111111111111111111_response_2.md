The bug occurs because the function `get_new_command` attempts to call a `shells.and_` method, which is not defined or imported. 

To fix the bug, the function should directly concatenate the strings "vagrant up" and `machine` using "&&" if `machine` is not an empty string. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    
    # Concatenating strings using "&&" if machine is not empty
    if machine:
        return 'vagrant up && vagrant ' + command.script
    else:
        return 'vagrant up && vagrant'
```
