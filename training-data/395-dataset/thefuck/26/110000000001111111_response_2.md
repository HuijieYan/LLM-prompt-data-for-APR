The buggy function `get_new_command` has a potential error in the line `return shells.and_("vagrant up " + machine, command.script)`. The function attempts to use the variable `machine` without verifying if it is empty or not. This might cause issues if the `machine` variable is empty for certain inputs.

The bug occurs because the `machine` variable is only set if the length of `cmds` is greater than or equal to 3, but the new command is always generated using `machine` without any check.

To fix this bug, we can perform the following steps:
1. Check if the `machine` variable is empty before concatenating it with the new command.
2. If the `machine` variable is not empty, include it in the new command. Otherwise, generate the new command without it.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]

    if machine:
        return shells.and_("vagrant up " + machine, command.script)
    else:
        return "vagrant up"
```
