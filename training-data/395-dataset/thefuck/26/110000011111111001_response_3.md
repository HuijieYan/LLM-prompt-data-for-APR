The bug is in the implementation of the `get_new_command` method. It fails to split the command script properly when the command contains multiple words and then tries to access a specific index from the split result without checking its length, leading to index out of range errors. Additionally, the logic to generate the `startAllInstances` variable is not working as intended.

The reasons behind this bug are:
1. Inadequate splitting of the command script.
2. Incorrect generation of the `startAllInstances` variable.

To fix the bug, we can follow these steps:
1. Split the command script using spaces to get the individual words in the command.
2. Check the length of the split result to ensure it has enough words to extract the required information. If it does, access the relevant index (2nd or 3rd) to get the machine name.
3. Modify the `startAllInstances` variable to concatenate "vagrant up" and the machine name (if available) with "&&" in between.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` method:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    return f"vagrant up {machine} && {command.script}"
```

By using string formatting to construct the return value, we can concatenate "vagrant up" and the machine name (if available) with "&&" in a single step. This ensures that the code behaves as intended for all test cases.
