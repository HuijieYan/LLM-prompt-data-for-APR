The bug appears to be in the `get_new_command` function, specifically in the line that constructs the new command using `shells.and_()`. This method is not used correctly. 

The buggy function is incorrectly constructing the new command by using `shells.and_()`. The output is sometimes returning an extra space before the '&&' operator due to a faulty concatenation. 

The function should be modified to properly handle constructing the new command with the correct operator and spacing.

Here's the corrected function code:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    return f"vagrant up {machine} && {command.script}"
```
