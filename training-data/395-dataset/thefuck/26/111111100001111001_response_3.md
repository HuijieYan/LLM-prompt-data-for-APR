The potential error in the provided function is the use of 'shells.and_' to concatenate strings. This seems to be incorrectly used.

The bug occurred because the 'shells.and_' function is not used correctly and the variable 'startAllInstances' is not defined in the function.

To fix the bug, the correct approach would be to concatenate the strings using the '+' operator and define the 'startAllInstances' variable to hold the new command.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    startAllInstances = "vagrant up " + machine
    return startAllInstances
```
