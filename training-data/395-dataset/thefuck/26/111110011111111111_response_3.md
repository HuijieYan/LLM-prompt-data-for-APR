The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to extract the machine name from the `command` and generate a new command using the extracted machine name. The issue arises from the line `return shells.and_("vagrant up " +  machine, command.script)` where it does not correctly handle cases where the machine name is missing or present.

The bug is occurring because the `machine` value is not being handled correctly. In the cases where `cmds` has a length less than 3, the `machine` is an empty string, and when the `cmds` has a length of 3, the `machine` is the third element of the list. However, the handling of the `machine` variable is not consistent, leading to incorrect new command generation.

To fix the bug, the `machine` variable should be included in the new command only if it is not an empty string. If it is empty, then the command should be "vagrant up" alone. 

Below is the corrected function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    if machine:
        return shells.and_("vagrant up " + machine, command.script)
    else:
        return "vagrant up"
```

This corrected function properly handles cases where the `machine` name is present and where it is not.
