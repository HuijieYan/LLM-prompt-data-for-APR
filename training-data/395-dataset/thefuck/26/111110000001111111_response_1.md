The bug in the provided function is that it tries to access a `command.script` attribute that does not exist. Instead, the `command` parameter is an object with `script` attribute, so the correct way to access the script is just `command` instead of `command.script`.

In the buggy function, the condition `if len(cmds) >= 3` is used to check if the command has more than 3 parts. This is causing issues as it doesn't handle commands with different numbers of parts properly.

To fix this bug:
1. We should split the `command` directly into parts instead of `command.script`.
2. We should check if the first element of the split command is 'vagrant' instead of checking the length of the split command.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if cmds[0] == 'vagrant':
        if len(cmds) >= 3:
            machine = cmds[2]
        return "vagrant up " +  machine + " && " + " ".join(cmds)
    else:
        return " ".join(cmds)
```
