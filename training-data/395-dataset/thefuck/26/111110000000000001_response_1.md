Potential error location: 
The potential error location is in the line "return shells.and_("vagrant up " + machine, command.script)". The "shells.and_" function does not seem to be a valid built-in function in Python, and it's not clear what it is supposed to do.

Reasons behind the bug:
1. The "split" method is used to separate the individual words in the "command.script" string, but it seems that "command.script" should actually be "command" based on the usage of "command.script" in the return statement.
2. The usage of "shells.and_" is not valid in Python and seems to be an undefined function.

Approach for fixing the bug:
1. Use the correct input for splitting the command into individual words.
2. Use a valid function or method to concatenate the strings and create the new command.

Corrected code:
```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    new_command = "vagrant up " + machine
    return new_command
```
