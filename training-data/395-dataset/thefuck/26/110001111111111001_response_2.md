The issues in the provided function and the corresponding error messages suggest that there are some problems in the function logic. The primary issue seems to be with the method `shells.and_` being referenced, and it is evident that it is not a recognized method.

Upon further analysis, the bug can be attributed to a wrong method call for joining the commands. The correct method should be `shutil.which` instead of `shells.and_`. Another problem is that the empty space after `vagrant up` should be removed.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
import shutil

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    return shutil.which("vagrant") + " up " +  machine + " && " + command.script
```
