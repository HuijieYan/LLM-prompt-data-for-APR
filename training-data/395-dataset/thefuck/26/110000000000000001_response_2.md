Potential Error Location:
The error is likely occurring in the line `cmds = command.script.split(' ')` where the function is attempting to split the `command.script` based on spaces.

Reasons Behind the Bug:
The function is trying to split the `command.script` without checking if the `command.script` actually exists or if it is a valid string.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if `command.script` exists and is not empty before attempting to split it.
2. Handle the case where `command.script` does not contain at least 3 elements after splitting.

Corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if command.script:
        cmds = command.script.split(' ')
        machine = ""
        if len(cmds) >= 3:
            machine = cmds[2]
        return shells.and_("vagrant up " +  machine, command.script)
    else:
        return "No command provided"
```
