The bug in the code is that the method `shells.and_` is being used incorrectly. This function creates a pipe chain in the shell, but the intention seems to be to concatenate the strings.

To fix the bug, the `shells.and_` function should be replaced with a simple string concatenation.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    return "vagrant up " +  machine + " " + command.script
```
