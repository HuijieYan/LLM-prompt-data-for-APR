Potential error location: The line "return shells.and_("vagrant up " +  machine, command.script)" is likely causing the bug.

Reason for the bug: The function is trying to concatenate "vagrant up" with the machine name and the original command, but it is not done properly.

Approach for fixing the bug: Use string formatting to properly concatenate the strings and fix the syntax error in the "return" statement.

Corrected code:
```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    return "vagrant up {} && {}".format(machine, command.script)
```
