The buggy function `get_new_command` takes a command and settings as input and splits the command script to extract the machine name, if present. It then appends this machine name to the command script "vagrant up" and returns the result. 

The potential error occurs when attempting to join the parts of the command script together. Instead of using `shells.and_`, the corrected approach should involve simply joining the strings with the "&&" operator.

The issue is that when joining the strings, the correct `&&` operator is not used, and the `shells.and_` method is also incorrectly applied. This method should be replaced with a simple string concatenation using the "&&" operator.

To fix the bug, the corrected function should look like this:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    return "vagrant up && " + command.script
```
