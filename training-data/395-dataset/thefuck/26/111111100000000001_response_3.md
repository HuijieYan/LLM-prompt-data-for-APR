Potential error:
The potential error in the code is the use of the `shells.and_` method, which does not seem to be a valid method in Python.

Reason behind the bug:
The `shells.and_` method is not a standard Python method and seems to be a typo or a mistake.

Approach for fixing the bug:
We need to correct the method to concatenate the strings and return a single string as the new command.

Corrected code:
```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    return "vagrant up " + machine + " " + command.script
```
