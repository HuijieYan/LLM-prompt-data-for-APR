Potential error:
The 'shells.and_' function seems to be undefined and is likely causing the error.

Reason behind the bug:
The 'shells.and_' function is not a built-in Python function, and it seems to be a custom function that is not imported or defined in the given code.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Import the module or library that contains the 'shells.and_' function and use it in the code.
2. If the 'shells.and_' function is a custom function, define it within the code.

Corrected code:
```python
# Importing the necessary module or library for 'shells.and_' function
# Assuming 'shells' is a custom module
import shells

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    return shells.and_("vagrant up " +  machine, command.script)
```
