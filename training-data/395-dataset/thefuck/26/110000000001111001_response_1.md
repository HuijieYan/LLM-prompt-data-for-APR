The code is trying to split the command.script into separate words and then extract the third word and store it in the machine variable. However, the function then tries to join the command with the variable machine using the shells.and_() method. One of the issues is that the and_ method doesn't exist in Python. Also, the logic of joining the strings is incorrect.

The error occurs because the code does not properly handle the cases where the command.script has different numbers of words that need to be split, and the way in which the machine variable is used to concatenate the strings is incorrect.

To fix the code, we can use string formatting to concatenate the strings, and check the length of cmds properly to prevent any index errors.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    return f"vagrant up {machine} && {command.script}"
```
