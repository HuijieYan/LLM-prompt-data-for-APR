The buggy function `get_new_command` takes a `command` object and a `settings` object, splits the script within the `command` object and uses the third element of the resulting list (if available) as the machine name. It then returns the result of concatenating "vagrant up" with the machine name (if available) and the original script from the `command` object.

There are several issues with the original function:
1. It uses a non-existent method `shells.and_`.
2. It doesn't handle the case where the machine name is not available in the script.
3. It doesn't handle the case where the original script already contains "vagrant up".

To fix this, we can replace `shells.and_` with the standard logical AND operator `and`, handle the cases when the machine name is not available or when "vagrant up" is already in the script, and also correctly concatenate the strings.

The corrected code for the problematic function `get_new_command` is as follows:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    
    # Check if "vagrant up" is already in the script
    if "vagrant up" not in command.script:
        new_script = f"vagrant up {machine} && {command.script}"
    else:
        new_script = command.script
    
    return new_script
```

This corrected code addresses the issues with the original function and properly handles different scenarios, such as when the machine name is not available or when "vagrant up" is already in the script.
