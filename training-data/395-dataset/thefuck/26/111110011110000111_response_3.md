The error is happening due to the incorrect implementation of the `get_new_command` function. The function is supposed to return a new command based on the input `command` and `settings`. The problem occurs because the function is using undefined helper functions (`shells.and_`) and is trying to split the `command.script` without checking if such a property exists.

The bug is caused by the `shells.and_` function which is not a standard Python function. It seems that the intention here was to concatenate strings and commands, but the `shells.and_` is not the appropriate way to do it.

To fix the bug, the `get_new_command` function should first check if the `command.script` exists and then manipulate it accordingly. If the length of `cmds` is greater or equal to 3, the function should concatenate the strings properly to form the new command.

The corrected code for the `get_new_command` function is as follows:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if hasattr(command, 'script'):
        cmds = command.script.split(' ')
        machine = ""
        if len(cmds) >= 3:
            machine = cmds[2]
        return f"vagrant up {machine} && {command.script}"
    else:
        return None
```
