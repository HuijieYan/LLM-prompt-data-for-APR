Potential error location: The error might be in the line "machine = cmds[2]" if the command.script does not contain at least 3 words separated by spaces.

Reason behind the bug: The buggy function does not handle the case when the command.script does not contain at least 3 words separated by spaces. This causes an "index out of range" error when trying to access cmds[2].

Approach for fixing the bug: We need to add a check to ensure that the length of cmds is at least 3 before trying to access cmds[2].

Corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
        return shells.and_("vagrant up " +  machine, command.script)
    else:
        return "Command script does not contain at least 3 words."
```
