The bug in the function `get_new_command` is the use of an undefined variable `shells` and the method `and_`. It seems like the intended use was some kind of shell command execution, but without further context, it's not possible to know which specific library/module provides this functionality.

To fix the bug, you need to import the appropriate library/module and use the correct method to execute the shell command.

Here is the corrected code assuming that you are trying to execute shell commands using the subprocess module:

```python
import subprocess

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    return subprocess.run(f"vagrant up {machine}", shell=True)
```

This code splits the command string into individual parts, checks if there is a third part to determine the machine, then uses `subprocess.run` to execute the command. Note that the actual use of subprocess will depend on your specific requirements and may need to handle command output, errors, etc.
