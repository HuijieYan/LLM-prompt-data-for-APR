The buggy function is splitting the `command.script` string by space and then assigning the second element to the variable `machine`. However, this method does not take into account the possibility of multiple words after the initial command.

The bug occurs because the function assumes the machine name to be the third element of the split command, which is incorrect when the command has more than two words.

To fix the bug, the function should handle different cases based on the length of the `cmds` list. If the length is 2, it means only the main command is given. If the length is more than 2, the machine name is present.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    return f"vagrant up {machine}"  # Return the corrected command
```

By modifying the return statement to incorporate the correct way of starting the vagrant machine, the bug is fixed.
