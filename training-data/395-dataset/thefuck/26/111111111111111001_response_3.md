The bug in the `get_new_command` function is that it is using `shells.and_` function, which is not defined or imported in the script.

The expected output for the test doesn't match the actual result. For example, for input `command.script='vagrant ssh'`, the expected output is `'vagrant up && vagrant ssh'`, but the actual output is `'vagrant up  && vagrant ssh'`. The extra space before `&&` is the issue.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the extra space before `&&` and use the correct `shells.and_` function. Additionally, handling the case when `machine` is empty is necessary.

Below is the corrected function:

```python
import shells

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    if machine:
        return shells.and_("vagrant up", "vagrant " + machine)
    else:
        return "vagrant up"
```
