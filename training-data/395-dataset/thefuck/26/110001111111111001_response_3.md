The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to split the input `command.script` by spaces and extract the third element of the resulting list, assigning it to the `machine` variable. Then, the function returns the concatenation of 'vagrant up ' and the machine value, along with the original command script.

The bug in the function is caused by an incorrect concatenation and formatting of the return statement. It should simply include 'vagrant up ' + machine if the machine variable is not empty, followed by the original command script.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    if machine:
        return "vagrant up " +  machine, command.script
    else:
        return command.script
```

The corrected function appropriately checks if the `machine` variable is not empty and returns the expected result as per the test cases provided.
