Potential Error Location: 
The error is likely occurring in the line "return shells.and_("vagrant up " + machine, command.script)". It seems the function shells.and_() is being used incorrectly and there is a missing import statement for shells.

Reasons for the Bug:
1. The function shells.and_() is being used without proper import and is not used correctly.
2. The machine variable might not be initialized properly based on the input command.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Import the required shells module to use the and_() function.
2. Initialize the machine variable properly to avoid any potential index out of range errors.

Corrected Code:
```python
import shells  # Import the required module

# Corrected function
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    return "vagrant up " +  machine + " && " + command.script
```
