The buggy function `get_new_command` takes a `Command` object and a `settings` parameter as input and returns a new command string. The function splits the input command by spaces, checks if there are at least three elements, and if so, sets the `machine` variable to the third element. Then it appends the `machine` value to the string and returns the result along with the original command.

After analyzing the test cases and their error messages, it's clear that there are issues with the concatenation of the strings and the presence of extra spaces in the resulting command. 

The main issue is with the way the new command is constructed, and the `shells.and_` function seems to be causing some problems. The call to this function seems to be redundant and incorrect, leading to the extra spaces and inconsistencies in the expected versus actual values.

To fix this bug:
1. Modify the logic to form the new command string by checking the length of the `cmds` list and constructing the new command manually without using `shells.and_`.
2. Remove the usage of `shells.and_` as it is contributing to the erroneous behavior.
3. Clean up the code to ensure proper handling of concatenation and spacing.

Here is the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:  # Checking if there are at least 3 elements
        machine = cmds[2]

    if machine:  # If machine is not empty, construct the new command to include it
        startAllInstances = f"vagrant up {machine} && {command.script}"
    else:  # If no machine is specified, use the original command
        startAllInstances = f"vagrant up && {command.script}"

    return startAllInstances
```

With these changes, the function should correctly handle creating the new command string based on the input `command` object and no longer exhibit the issues observed in the test cases.
