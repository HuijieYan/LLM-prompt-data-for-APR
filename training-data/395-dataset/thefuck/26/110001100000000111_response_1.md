Potential error location: The buggy line is "return shells.and_("vagrant up " +  machine, command.script)". It seems to be trying to concatenate the command "vagrant up" with the machine name and then combine it with the original command script. 

Reason for the bug: The use of "shells.and_" is incorrect. It is likely a typo or a mistake in referencing the correct method.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We should use the correct method or approach to combine the strings and create the new command. We can also handle the case where the machine name may not be present in the original command.

```python
# Corrected function
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    new_command = "vagrant up " + machine if machine else "vagrant up"
    return new_command + " " + ' '.join(cmds[1:])
```
