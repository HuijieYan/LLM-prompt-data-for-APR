The buggy function is `get_new_command` and it seems to have multiple issues.
The function is splitting the `command.script` into a list using a space as the delimiter. Then, it tries to access the third element of the list using index 2. But if the command is just 'vagrant ssh' or 'vagrant rdp', there is no third element, so this will cause an IndexError. It is also appending the command.script at the end which may not be necessary.

To fix these issues, we need to ensure that we handle cases where the command.script has fewer than 3 words and construct the new command appropriately.

Also, the `shells.and_` function is being used without any import statement for it.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from sh import and_

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
        return and_("vagrant up " + machine, command.script)
    else:
        return and_("vagrant up", command.script)
```

By using the `and_` function from the `sh` module, we can combine the "vagrant up" command and the original command.script, handling cases where the command script is composed of fewer than 3 words.

This should fix the bugs in the original code.
