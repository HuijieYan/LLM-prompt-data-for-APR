The buggy function is `get_new_command`. It seems that the function aims to add the `vagrant up` command before any vagrant command that requires the VM to be running or created. However, the issue arises from how the `shells.and_` is used and the incorrect use of the `machine` variable.

The issue with the error messages lies in the comparison between the expected and actual output of the `get_new_command` function. In all error messages, there's a mismatch between the expected output and the actual output of the buggy function.

The `machine` variable is not used correctly in the buggy function. It is being concatenated with the command script using `'vagrant up ' + machine`, assuming it is necessary in all cases.

To fix the bug, the `machine` variable should only be used when the second element of `cmds` is not 'up'. If it's 'up', then `machine` should be an empty string.

Below is the corrected code for the function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 2 and cmds[1] != 'up':  # Adjusted conditional check to handle 'up'
        machine = cmds[1]
        return shells.and_("vagrant up " +  machine, command.script)
    else:
        return shells.and_("vagrant up", command.script)
```

In this correction, the `machine` variable is assigned based on the elements of `cmds`. If the command is not 'up', the `machine` will be set accordingly. Otherwise, the `machine` will remain an empty string. Then, the correct `vagrant up` command is appended to the original command, with or without the `machine`, as needed.
