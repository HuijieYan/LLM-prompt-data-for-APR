The error in the function lies in the line `return shells.and_("vagrant up " +  machine, command.script)`. The function attempts to access `command.script` directly, but `command` is an instance of a class and does not have an attribute `script`.

The reason behind the bug is that the function is attempting to access a non-existent attribute of an object, resulting in an AttributeError.

To fix this bug, the function should access the `script` attribute of the `command` object directly, and concatenate it with the `machine`. We can also handle cases where the `machine` is empty.

Below is the corrected function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    if machine:
        return f"vagrant up {machine} && {command.script}"
    else:
        return f"vagrant up && {command.script}"
```
