The potential error in the code is that the function is trying to call `shells.and_` which does not seem to be defined anywhere in the code.

The reason behind the bug is that the `shells.and_` function is not imported or defined in the given code, so it will result in a NameError.

To fix this bug, the function should concatenate the strings using the `+` operator and return the result.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    return "vagrant up " + machine + " " + command.script
```
