The bug in the `get_new_command` function is likely related to how the `and_` function is being used to combine the "vagrant up" command with the rest of the command script.

The error messages from the test functions indicate that the expected new commands do not match the actual new commands generated by the `get_new_command` function. This suggests that the function may not be correctly combining the commands.

Upon review, the error seems to stem from the misuse of the `and_` function. The `and_` function is typically used to combine conditions in Python, but in this context, it seems that the intention is to concatenate the two commands with the "&&" shell command.

To fix this bug, we should concatenate the two commands with "&&" without using the `and_` function.

Here's the corrected `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    return f"vagrant up {machine} && {command.script}"
```
