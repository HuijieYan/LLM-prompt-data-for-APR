In this code, the `get_new_command` function is supposed to split the input `command` based on spaces and then retrieve the third element to store in the variable `machine`. After that, it should construct a new command using the `shells.and_` function from an unknown module/library, passing "vagrant up " + machine and `command.script` as arguments.

The error occurs because `command` is an object with attributes such as `script`, and `script` is not an attribute of `command` but the value of `command.script`. Therefore, `command.script` should be used instead of `command.script`.

Also, the correcting variable `machine` is being appended with an extra space which leads to incorrect command construction. This can be resolved by modifying the line `machine = cmds[2]` to `machine = cmds[2] if len(cmds) > 2 else ""`. This way, the presence of the third element is checked before assigning its value to `machine`.

Below is the corrected implementation of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = cmds[2] if len(cmds) > 2 else ""
    return shells.and_("vagrant up " + machine, command.script)
```
