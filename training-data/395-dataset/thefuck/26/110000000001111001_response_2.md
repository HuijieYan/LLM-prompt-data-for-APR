The potential error in the provided function is that it uses a method 'shells.and_' which is not defined within the function. This could be the reason for the function failing to execute and return the expected results.

To fix this bug, consider using the built-in Python `shutil` module to execute shell commands.

The corrected code for the function is as follows:

```python
import subprocess

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    return f"vagrant up {machine} && {' '.join(cmds)}"
```
