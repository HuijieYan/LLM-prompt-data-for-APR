Potential error location:
The error may be in the line `return shells.and_("vagrant up " +  machine, command.script)`.

Reason for the bug:
It seems like the `shells.and_` method is being used incorrectly, possibly due to a mismatch in the method signature or the wrong method being used.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
We can use the `subprocess` module to execute the command instead of trying to concatenate the strings and use `shells.and_` method. The corrected code should construct a new command that includes "vagrant up" followed by the machine name.

Corrected code:
```python
import subprocess

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    new_command = "vagrant up " + machine
    subprocess.run(new_command, shell=True)
    return new_command
```
