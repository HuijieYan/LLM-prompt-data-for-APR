The bug is likely caused by the use of the "shells.and_" method, which is not a standard Python method. This is likely causing the test cases to fail since it's not handling the command correctly.

To fix the bug, the "shells.and_" method should be replaced with the standard Python concatenation operator ("+"). This will fix the issue of concatenating the "vagrant up" command with the machine name or the rest of the command.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    return "vagrant up " +  machine + " && " + command.script
```
