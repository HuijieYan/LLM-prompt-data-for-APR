Potential error location: 
The potential error location is in the `split` method being used on the `command.script`, which is likely not a string.

Reason for the bug:
The `command.script` may not be a string, and using the `split` method on a non-string object will result in an error.

Approach to fix the bug:
Check if the `command.script` is a string before splitting it. If it's not a string, handle this scenario appropriately.

Corrected code:
```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if isinstance(command.script, str):
        cmds = command.script.split(' ')
        machine = ""
        if len(cmds) >= 3:
            machine = cmds[2]
        return shells.and_("vagrant up " +  machine, command.script)
    else:
        # handle the scenario where command.script is not a string
        return "Error: command script is not a string"
```
