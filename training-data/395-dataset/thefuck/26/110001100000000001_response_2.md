Potential error location: 
The buggy line is "return shells.and_("vagrant up " +  machine, command.script)". There are a few issues here. It looks like the intention is to construct a new command using "vagrant up" followed by the "machine" variable and then the rest of the original command. However, the syntax used to concatenate these strings is incorrect.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The intention of the function is to construct a new command by adding the "machine" variable to the "vagrant up" command and then adding the rest of the original command. However, the way the strings are concatenated in the return statement is incorrect, resulting in a syntax error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use proper string concatenation to construct the new command.
2. Ensure that the new command is constructed correctly based on the original command.

Corrected code:
```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    new_command = "vagrant up " + machine + " " + ' '.join(cmds[3:])
    return new_command
```
