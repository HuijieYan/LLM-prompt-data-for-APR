Potential error location: The error might be in the line `return shells.and_("vagrant up " +  machine, command.script)` as it is attempting to concatenate two commands in a way that is not compatible with the python syntax.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The error is occurring because the function is trying to concatenate the "vagrant up" command with the machine name using a syntax that is not valid in python.

Approaches for fixing the bug: We can use the `subprocess` module to run the "vagrant up" command with the machine name as an argument.

```python
# This is the corrected code for the problematic function
import subprocess

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    cmds = command.script.split(' ')
    machine = ""
    if len(cmds) >= 3:
        machine = cmds[2]
    subprocess.call(["vagrant", "up", machine])
```
