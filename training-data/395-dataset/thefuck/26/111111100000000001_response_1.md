The potential error in the provided function is that it is attempting to use a method `split` on the `command` object, which is likely not defined as a string and thus does not have the `split` method.

The error occurs because the function is trying to access the `split` method on the `command` object, which is not a string. This results in an AttributeError.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the `command` is a string before using the `split` method. If it is not a string, we should handle it accordingly.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if isinstance(command.script, str):
        cmds = command.script.split(' ')
        machine = ""
        if len(cmds) >= 3:
            machine = cmds[2]
        return shells.and_("vagrant up " +  machine, command.script)
    else:
        return "Command is not a string"
```
