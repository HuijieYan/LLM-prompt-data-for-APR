The error is occurring because the `get_new_command` function is not correctly replacing the 'push' command with 'push --force-with-lease'. The code is only replacing 'push' with 'push --force', which leads to the assertion error in the test cases.

To fix this, we need to modify the `get_new_command` function to correctly replace 'push' with 'push --force-with-lease'.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    return command.script.replace('git push', 'git push --force-with-lease')
```
