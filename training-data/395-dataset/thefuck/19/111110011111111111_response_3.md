The issue with the `get_new_command` function is that it is using a decorator `@git_support`, which is not defined in the given source code. This is causing the function to not work as expected.

The bug occurs because the decorator `@git_support` is not defined, so it is not being used properly to manipulate the `get_new_command` function.

To fix the bug:
- Remove the `@git_support` decorator as it is not defined and not required for the given function.
- Modify the `get_new_command` function to directly manipulate the input `command` and replace the "push" command with "push --force".

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    return command.replace_argument('push', 'push --force')
```
