The error occurs because the `replace_argument` function inside the `get_new_command` method is replacing 'push' with 'push --force', but the expected output also includes '--force-with-lease'. This discrepancy causes the assertion error in the test cases.

The potential error location is the `replace_argument` function, specifically its inability to handle the additional arguments like '--force-with-lease' in the expected output.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `replace_argument` function is not considering the presence of additional arguments when replacing 'push' with 'push --force'.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to modify the `replace_argument` function to handle additional arguments as well as the base command. Another approach is to use a different method or function that correctly appends '--force-with-lease' rather than simply replacing the argument.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    return command.script.replace('git push', 'git push --force-with-lease')
```
