Potential Error Location:
The current function is simply replacing the 'push' command with 'push --force' without checking if 'push --force' already exists in the command. This will lead to the addition of 'push --force' every time the function is called, which may not be the desired behavior.

Reasons Behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not check if 'push --force' already exists in the command before adding it. This leads to the command getting longer each time the function is called, potentially causing unexpected behavior.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if 'push --force' already exists in the command before adding it. If it does, then return the original command without modification.
2. Use regular expressions to replace only the 'push' command that is followed by specific patterns (e.g., space or end of line).

Corrected Code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_19/thefuck/rules/git_push_force.py

import re

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if 'push --force' in command.script:
        return command.script
    else:
        return re.sub(r'\bpush\b', 'push --force', command.script)
```
