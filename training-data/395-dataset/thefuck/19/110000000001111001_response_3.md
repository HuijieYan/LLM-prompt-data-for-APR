The buggy function `get_new_command` seems to be using a decorator `@git_support` which is not defined in the provided code. It is likely that this decorator is meant to handle cases related to the git commands. 

The current implementation of the function has a hardcoded replacement for the 'push' command. However, it does not handle cases where additional arguments are provided along with the 'push' command.

To fix the bug, the function needs to check if the 'push' command is already included in the input command. If it is, then it should append the '--force' option to the existing 'push' command. If the 'push' command is not included, then it should simply return the original command.

Below is the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if 'push' in command.script:
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', 'push --force')
    else:
        return command
```

With this corrected code, the function will now correctly handle the three input cases provided.
