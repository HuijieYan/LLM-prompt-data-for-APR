The buggy function is a part of a Python script that is part of the "thefuck" project and is located in the file "git_push_force.py". This function is meant to add the --force flag to a git push command. However, the function is not correctly implementing this functionality.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of the `replace_argument` function. It seems like the intention is to replace the "push" command with "push --force" in the script, but it is not being done in the correct way.

The bug occurs because the `replace_argument` function doesn't seem to exist and is not defined within the provided code.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `get_new_command` function to directly append the "--force" flag to the command.

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_19/thefuck/rules/git_push_force.py

# corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    return command.script.replace('push', 'push --force', 1)  # append --force after 'push'
```
