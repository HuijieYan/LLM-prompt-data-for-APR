The function get_new_command is intended to replace the 'push' command with 'push --force'. However, the test cases are expecting 'push --force-with-lease' instead.

The bug is occurring because the get_new_command function does not correctly replace 'push' with 'push --force-with-lease'.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the get_new_command function to replace 'push' with 'push --force-with-lease' instead of just 'push --force'.

Here's the corrected code for the get_new_command function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    return replace_argument(command.script, 'git push', 'git push --force-with-lease')
```
