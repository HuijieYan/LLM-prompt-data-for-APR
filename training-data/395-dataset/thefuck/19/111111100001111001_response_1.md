The buggy function is aimed at replacing the 'push' command with 'push --force' in a given command. However, it seems to be targeting the wrong part of the input command.

The potential error location is in the line:
```python
return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', 'push --force')
```
This line only replaces the first occurrence of 'push' with 'push --force' in the command.script. However, in the provided input command, 'push' occurs multiple times, and the intention might be to replace it with 'push --force' wherever it occurs.

The bug occurs because the function 'replace_argument' is being used incorrectly. The 'replace_argument' function might be intended to replace all occurrences of a substring in a string, but the implementation is only replacing the first occurrence.

To fix the bug, the function should use the 'replace' method instead of 'replace_argument' to replace all occurrences of 'push' with 'push --force'.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    return command.script.replace('push', 'push --force')
```
