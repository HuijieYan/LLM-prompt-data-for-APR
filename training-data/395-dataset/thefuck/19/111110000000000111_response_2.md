Potential Error Location:
The error is likely caused by the use of the @git_support decorator, which is not defined in the provided code. This decorator is not recognized and causes the function to fail.

Reasons for the Bug:
The @git_support decorator is not defined in the code, so it is causing the function to fail when it is applied to get_new_command.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Remove the @git_support decorator and directly define the get_new_command function.
2. Define the @git_support decorator to properly support the get_new_command function.

Corrected Code:
```python
def git_support(func):
    # Define the git support functionality here
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

# Corrected function without decorator
def get_new_command(command):
    return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', 'push --force')
```
