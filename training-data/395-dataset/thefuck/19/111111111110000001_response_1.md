The buggy function is `get_new_command`, which is used to replace the 'push' argument with 'push --force'. The error occurs because the replace_argument function is not defined, meaning that it's not possible to verify the output of the test case. There is also an @git_support decorator at the beginning of the function definition, but it's not clear what it does. 

To fix the bug, the function needs to import replace_argument or define it within the function itself. Additionally, the @git_support decorator needs to be removed as it's not clear what it does and might be causing unintended side effects.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    return command.script.replace('push', 'push --force')
```
