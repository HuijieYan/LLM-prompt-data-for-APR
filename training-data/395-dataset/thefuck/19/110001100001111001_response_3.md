The buggy function `get_new_command` is intended to replace the 'push' command with 'push --force' in the input command. However, the code is not correctly implementing this logic. The `replace_argument` function seems to be missing, and the function is not handling the input command properly.

The bug occurs because the function `get_new_command` does not correctly detect and replace the 'push' command with 'push --force' in the input command.

To fix the bug, we need to use the `replace` function to replace the 'push' command with 'push --force'. Additionally, we need to handle the command properly, ensuring that the replacements occur at the intended locations.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_19/thefuck/rules/git_push_force.py

# Corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if 'push' in command.script:
        new_script = command.script.replace('push', 'push --force')
        return Command(script=new_script, stdout=command.stdout, stderr=command.stderr)
    else:
        return command
``` 

In the corrected code, we first check if the 'push' command is present in the input command. If it is, we use the `replace` function to replace 'push' with 'push --force' in the command script. We then construct and return a new `Command` object with the updated script. If the 'push' command is not present, we simply return the original command.
