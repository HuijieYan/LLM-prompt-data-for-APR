The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to take a command as input and replace the argument 'push' with 'push --force'. However, the function is not correctly implemented, as it only replaces 'push' with 'push --force' without considering the presence of additional arguments after 'push'.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle additional arguments after 'push' correctly. It simply appends ' --force' to the original command without considering the structure of the input command.

To fix the bug, the function should split the input command into individual arguments, insert ' --force' after 'push', and then join the arguments back together.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    arguments = command.script.split()
    index = arguments.index('push')
    arguments.insert(index + 1, '--force')
    return ' '.join(arguments)
``` 

This corrected code properly handles the input commands with 'push' and additional arguments, inserting '--force' after 'push' while handling the rest of the command structure.
