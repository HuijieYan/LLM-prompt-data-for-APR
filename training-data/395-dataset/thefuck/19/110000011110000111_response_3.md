The buggy function get_new_command is intended to take a command as input and replace the argument 'push' with 'push --force' in the command script. However, it seems that the function is using 'push --force-with-lease' instead of 'push --force' as expected in the test cases.

It appears that the function get_new_command is not correctly replacing the argument 'push' with 'push --force'.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the get_new_command function to replace 'push' with 'push --force' instead of 'push --force-with-lease'.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', 'push --force')
```

With this change, the function should correctly replace 'push' with 'push --force', and the test cases should pass without any assertion errors.
