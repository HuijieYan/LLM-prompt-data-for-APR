The buggy function is expecting the `command` parameter to be an object with `script`, `stdout`, and `stderr` attributes, but it is not explicitly defined in the function. This could be causing the function to fail.

The analysis of the error messages indicates that the expected output is different from the actual output, leading to assertion errors.

The potential error location is within the `get_new_command` function, where the `command` parameter is being utilized without a proper definition or handling of its attributes.

The bug occurs because the `command` parameter is not used correctly within the function. It is expected to have `script`, `stdout`, and `stderr` attributes, but the function does not handle them properly.

To fix the bug, the `get_new_command` function should explicitly define the attributes of the `command` parameter (`script`, `stdout`, `stderr`) and use them accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    return command.script.replace('push', 'push --force')
```

In this corrected code, the `get_new_command` function properly handles the `script` attribute of the `command` parameter and replaces the 'push' command with 'push --force'.
