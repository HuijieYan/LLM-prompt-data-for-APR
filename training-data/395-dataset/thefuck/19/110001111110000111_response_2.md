The buggy function `get_new_command` is intended to replace the argument 'push' with 'push --force' in the given command. However, the function is not replacing 'push' with the correct string 'push --force' or 'push --force-with-lease' as indicated in the error message.

The error message from the test functions indicates that the expected output includes 'push --force-with-lease' for the 'git push' command and 'push --force-with-lease nvbn' for the 'git push nvbn' command. However, the function is currently returning 'push --force' for both cases, which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, the function needs to replace 'push' with 'push --force-with-lease' instead of just 'push --force'.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_19/thefuck/rules/git_push_force.py

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', 'push --force-with-lease')
```
