The bug in the provided code is that the `get_new_command` function is called with a `Command` object, but the function tries to access `command.script` directly, which is incorrect. Instead, it should access `command.script` via `command`, like `command.script`.

The reason for the issue is that the function is not correctly accessing the `script` attribute of the `Command` object. This leads to incorrect results and causes the test cases to fail.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to access the `script` attribute of the `Command` object correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_19/thefuck/rules/git_push_force.py

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', 'push --force')
```

With this correction, the function will correctly access the `script` attribute of the `Command` object and provide the expected output, resolving the bug.
