The error occurs because the function is not properly replacing the "push" command with "push --force" as intended. The function is using the `replace_argument` method, which is not defined in the provided code. This is causing the AssertionError in the test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to replace the `replace_argument` method with Python's built-in string method `replace()`. This will correctly replace the "push" command with "push --force".

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    return command.script.replace('git push', 'git push --force')
```

This corrected function will replace the "push" command with "push --force", as expected.
