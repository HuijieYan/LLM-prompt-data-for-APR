The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to replace the 'push' argument with 'push --force' in the given command. However, it doesn't take into account whether 'push' is followed by any other arguments or not.

The bug occurs because the `replace_argument` function is not handling the case where 'push' is followed by other arguments.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `get_new_command` function to handle the case where 'push' is followed by other arguments.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if command.script.startswith('git push'):
        return command.script.replace('git push', 'git push --force', 1)
    else:
        return None
```

In the corrected code, we're first checking if the command starts with 'git push'. If it does, we replace the first occurrence of 'git push' with 'git push --force'. If it doesn't start with 'git push', we return None. This fix addresses the issue and handles the cases where 'push' is followed by additional arguments.
