The buggy function is attempting to add the "--force" flag to a git push command. However, the function is not handling the case where the "push" command already has additional arguments provided. It is only replacing the "push" command with "push --force", instead of adding "--force" to the existing command.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to first check if the "push" command already has additional arguments, and if so, then add "--force" to the existing command.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_19/thefuck/rules/git_push_force.py

# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    push_index = command.script.index('push')
    if push_index != -1:  # If 'push' is found in the command
        if len(command.script) > push_index + 1 and command.script[push_index + 1] != '--force':
            command.script.insert(push_index + 1, '--force')
        elif len(command.script) == push_index + 1:
            command.script.append('--force')

    return command.script
```
