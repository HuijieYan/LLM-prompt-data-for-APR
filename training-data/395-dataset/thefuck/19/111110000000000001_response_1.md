Potential Error Location:
The error is likely related to the fact that the function is trying to use a decorator `@git_support` but the `git_support` decorator is not implemented or defined in the code.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The `git_support` decorator is missing or not implemented, so the function is unable to utilize it as intended.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Define and implement the `@git_support` decorator in the code.
2. If the `@git_support` decorator is not needed, remove it from the function definition.

Corrected Code:
```python
# Assuming the @git_support decorator is not needed
def get_new_command(command):
    return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', 'push --force')
```
