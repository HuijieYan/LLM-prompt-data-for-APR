The buggy function is using a decorator `@git_support`, but the definition of this decorator is not provided. It seems that the decorator is meant to modify the behavior of the `get_new_command` function, but without knowing its implementation, it's difficult to fix the function directly.

It appears that the function is supposed to modify the `command` parameter and replace the 'push' command with 'push --force'.

The decorator `@git_support` is not defined in the given code, and it's not clear what it should do. One possible approach to fix the function is to remove the decorator and directly modify the `get_new_command` function to achieve the desired behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if 'push' in command.script:
        return Command(script=command.script.replace('push', 'push --force'), stdout=command.stdout, stderr=command.stderr)
    else:
        return command
```

This corrected code directly checks if the 'push' command is present in the `command.script`. If it is, it replaces 'push' with 'push --force', and then returns a new `Command` object with the modified script. If 'push' is not present, the original `command` is returned.
