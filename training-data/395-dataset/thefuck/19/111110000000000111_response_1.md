The bug in the provided function is that it is using a decorator `@git_support` which is not defined. This is causing a syntax error.

To fix this bug, we can remove the `@git_support` decorator from the function.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', 'push --force')
```
