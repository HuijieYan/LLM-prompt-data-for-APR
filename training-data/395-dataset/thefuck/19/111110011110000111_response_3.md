The error occurs due to the incorrect implementation of the `get_new_command` function. The function is using `replace_argument` to replace 'push' with 'push --force', which is not correct because it does not take into account multiple possible arguments after 'git push'. Additionally, the error messages in the test cases show that the expected output contains '--force-with-lease' instead of '--force'.

To fix the bug:
1. Update the `get_new_command` function to handle multiple arguments after 'git push'.
2. Replace 'push' with 'push --force-with-lease' instead of 'push --force' as the expected output suggests.
3. Since the method `replace_argument` does not exist in Python by default, we need to create a custom function to handle the replacement of the 'git push' command.

```python
# Corrected get_new_command function
def get_new_command(command):
    parts = command.script.split(' ')
    if parts[0] == 'git' and parts[1] == 'push':
        return 'git push --force-with-lease ' + ' '.join(parts[2:])
    else:
        return command.script
```

By using the corrected `get_new_command` function, the function will now correctly handle the 'git push' command with or without additional arguments and will replace it with 'git push --force-with-lease'. This should fix the bug and align the output with the expected results in the test cases.
