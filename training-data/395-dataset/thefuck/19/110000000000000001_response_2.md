Potential error: The function is using a decorator `@git_support`, but the decorator has not been defined or implemented.

Reason for the bug: The function is attempting to use a decorator `@git_support` but the decorator has not been defined or implemented, which will result in a syntax error.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We need to define the `git_support` decorator properly and also fix the function to use it correctly.

Corrected code:

```python
# Define the git_support decorator
def git_support(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        # Additional git support logic can be added here
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

# Use the git_support decorator on the function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', 'push --force')

# The rest of the function remains the same as it was
```
