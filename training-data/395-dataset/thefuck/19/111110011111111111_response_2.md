The buggy function `get_new_command` is meant to replace the argument in the `command.script` from "push" to "push --force". However, the error messages indicate that the function is not returning the correct result for the given input parameters.

The potential error location within the function is the `replace_argument` method. It seems that the method is not correctly replacing the "push" command with "push --force".

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be related to the incorrect implementation of the `replace_argument` method. It may not be handling the replacement of the argument properly.

To fix the bug, the `replace_argument` method needs to be adjusted to correctly replace the "push" command with "push --force". One possible approach is to use the `str.replace` method, which is a built-in method in Python for string manipulation.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    return command.script.replace('push', 'push --force')
```

With this correction, the `get_new_command` function should now return the expected output for the given input parameters.
