Potential Error Location:
The error is likely within the `@git_support` decorator, as it is not defined or implemented in the provided code. 

Reasons for the Bug:
The `@git_support` decorator is not defined or implemented, so it is causing an error when used in the `get_new_command` function.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Define and implement the `@git_support` decorator.
2. If the `@git_support` decorator is supposed to handle Git-specific commands, it should be designed to modify the command in a way that is compatible with Git syntax.

Corrected Code:
```python
# Define and implement the git_support decorator
def git_support(func):
    def wrapper(command):
        # Implement logic for supporting git commands
        modified_command = replace_argument(command.script, 'push', 'push --force')
        return func(modified_command)
    return wrapper

# Corrected get_new_command function with the defined git_support decorator
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    return command
```
