The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to replace the 'push' command with 'push --force'. However, it currently only looks for 'push' and replaces it with 'push --force', which is incorrect.

The function should be modified to only add ' --force' if the original command contains 'push' followed by other arguments.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if command.script.startswith('git push'):
        return replace_command(command, command.script + ' --force')
    else:
        return None
```
