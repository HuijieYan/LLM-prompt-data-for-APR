The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to replace the 'push' keyword with 'push --force' in the given command. However, the test cases are failing because the 'push' keyword is being replaced by 'push --force-with-lease' instead of 'push --force'.

The reason for this bug is that the function is using the `replace_argument` incorrectly. It should only replace the 'push' keyword with 'push --force', but it's also appending the '--with-lease' part.

To fix this bug, the function should remove the unnecessary parts from the replacement and directly append '--force' after 'push'.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_19/thefuck/rules/git_push_force.py

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', 'push --force')
```
