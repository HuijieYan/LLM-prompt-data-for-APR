The problematic function is `get_new_command` which is supposed to add the `--force` argument to a git push command. However, according to the error messages, it is adding `--force` instead of `--force-with-lease`.

The reason behind the bug is that the function is simply replacing "push" with "push --force" without considering the case where "push" is followed by other arguments.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to add the `--force-with-lease` argument instead of `--force` when it encounters a "git push" command.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if command.script.startswith('git push'):
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', 'push --force-with-lease')
    else:
        return command.script
```
This updated function checks if the command script starts with 'git push' and if so, it replaces 'push' with 'push --force-with-lease'. If the command script doesn't start with 'git push', it simply returns the command.script as is.
