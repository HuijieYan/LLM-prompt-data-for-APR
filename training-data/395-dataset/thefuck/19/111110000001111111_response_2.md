Potential Error Location: The error is likely in the replace_argument function, where 'push' is being replaced with 'push --force'.

Reason for the Bug: The buggy function, get_new_command, is not correctly handling the input command. The function is simply replacing 'push' with 'push --force', which may not be appropriate in all cases. It is not considering if 'push' is followed by any other arguments.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: 
1. Use a more robust method to identify and replace the 'push' command, such as using regular expressions to match the 'push' command in the input command string.
2. Check if 'push' is standalone or followed by other arguments before performing the replacement.

Corrected Code:
```python
# corrected function
def get_new_command(command):
    if 'push ' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace('push', 'push --force', 1)
    else:
        return command.script
```
