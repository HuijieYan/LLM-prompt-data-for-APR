The buggy function `get_new_command` is meant to replace the 'push' command with 'push --force' in the `command.script`. However, it is not doing so correctly.

The issue here is that the function is taking the entire command as a string and replacing 'push' with 'push --force', which results in incorrect outputs.

To fix this issue, we need to update the function to handle the command and arguments separately.

We can fix the function as follows:

```python
# Updated function
def get_new_command(command):
    parts = command.script.split(' ')
    if 'push' in parts:
        index = parts.index('push')
        parts.insert(index + 1, '--force')
    return ' '.join(parts)
```

This updated function splits the command into its parts, checks if 'push' is present, and if it is, inserts '--force' after 'push'. Then it joins the parts back into a single string. This approach should address the issues mentioned in the test cases.
