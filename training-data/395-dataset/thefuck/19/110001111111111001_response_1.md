The problem with the provided function is that it always replaces 'push' with 'push --force' regardless of the situation. This leads to incorrect output in all test cases.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle different scenarios based on the input command.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_19/thefuck/rules/git_push_force.py

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if 'rejected' in command.stderr:
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', 'push --force-with-lease')
    else:
        return command.script  # No need to change the command if it's not rejected
```
