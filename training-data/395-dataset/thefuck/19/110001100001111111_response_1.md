The buggy function `get_new_command` is meant to replace the word "push" with "push --force" in the input command. However, it is not able to handle cases where additional arguments are provided after "push", as it simply replaces "push" regardless of the context.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the function to handle cases where additional arguments are provided after "push." We can achieve this by using regular expressions to find and replace "push" only when it is followed by a space or the end of the string.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    return re.sub(r'push\b', 'push --force', command.script)
```

This code uses the `re.sub` method to replace the word "push" with "push --force" only when it is a whole word, not part of another word. This should handle the cases where "push" is followed by additional arguments.
