The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to replace the "push" command with "push --force" in the input command, but it's not doing that properly. 

The potential error in the code is that the `replace_argument` function is not being called correctly. It seems that `replace_argument` is intended to replace the "push" argument with "push --force", but the way it's being called doesn't reflect that intention.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `replace_argument` function is not being used properly. It seems to take two arguments (original command and replacement command), but it's not being called with these arguments in the given code.

To fix the bug, the correct way to use the `replace_argument` function needs to be determined and then applied to the `get_new_command` function. This may involve changing the parameters passed to `replace_argument` and adjusting the code accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    return command.script.replace('push', 'push --force')
```
