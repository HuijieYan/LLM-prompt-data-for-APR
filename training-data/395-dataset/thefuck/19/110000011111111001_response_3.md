The issue with the function `get_new_command` is that it assumes the input command always contains the word "push" and replaces it with "push --force". However, the command can also contain additional arguments, as seen in the input parameters for the test function.

The buggy function assumes that the command only contains a single word, and when additional arguments are passed, it fails to handle them correctly.

To fix the issue, the function should first split the command string by spaces, check if "push" is present in the list of arguments, and then replace it with "push --force" accordingly.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    args = command.script.split()
    if 'push' in args:
        args[args.index('push')] = 'push --force'
    return ' '.join(args)
```

This function will correctly handle cases where additional arguments are present in the command and only replace the "push" command with "push --force".
