Potential Error:
The `replace_argument` function is not defined within the given function, causing the code to fail.

Reason for the Bug:
The `replace_argument` function is being called without being defined within the context of the given function. This results in a NameError and causes the code to fail.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
We need to define the `replace_argument` function or import it if it is part of an external library. Then we can use it to replace the argument in the `command.script` to fix the bug.

Corrected Code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_19/thefuck/rules/git_push_force.py

from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.shells import git_support

# corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', 'push --force')
```
