Potential error location: The buggy function is using the `replace_argument` function to replace 'push' with 'push --force'. However, this is a simplistic approach and does not consider whether 'push' is part of another command (e.g., 'git push origin master') or a standalone command.

Reason for the bug: The `replace_argument` function is replacing 'push' with 'push --force' without considering the context in which 'push' appears in the command. This leads to incorrect command modifications when 'push' is part of a longer command.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Instead of using 'replace_argument', we should split the command into individual words and check if 'push' is part of another command. If not, we can append '--force' to the command. This will ensure that 'push --force' is only appended to standalone 'git push' commands.

```python
# Corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Split the command into individual words
    words = command.script.split(' ')
    
    # Check if 'push' is a standalone command
    if len(words) == 2 and words[0] == 'git' and words[1] == 'push':
        return command.script + ' --force'
    else:
        return command.script
```
In the corrected function, we first split the command into individual words. Then, we check if the first two words are 'git push'. If they are, we append '--force' to the command, indicating that it is a standalone 'git push' command. Otherwise, we return the original command as-is.
