The buggy function `get_new_command` is expected to take a command and replace the 'push' argument with 'push --force'. However, it seems to be using an undefined decorator `@git_support` and the `replace_argument` function is also not defined.

The error messages from the test cases indicate that the function is not replacing the 'push' argument as expected and is generating incorrect output.

To fix the bug, the following steps can be suggested:

1. Remove the `@git_support` decorator if it is not used.
2. Define the `replace_argument` function to replace the 'push' argument with 'push --force' in the command script.
3. Update the function to handle the case where the 'push' command already contains additional arguments as shown in the test cases.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if 'push' in script_parts:
        index = script_parts.index('push')
        script_parts.insert(index + 1, '--force')
        return ' '.join(script_parts)
    else:
        return command.script
```

This corrected function splits the command script into parts, checks if 'push' is present, and if it is, inserts '--force' after it. Then it joins the parts back into a string. If 'push' is not present, it returns the original command script. This should address the issues mentioned in the error messages.
