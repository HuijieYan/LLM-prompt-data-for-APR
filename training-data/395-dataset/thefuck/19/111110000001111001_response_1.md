The buggy function uses a decorator `@git_support` which is not defined. This is likely the cause of the error.

To fix the bug, the decorator `@git_support` should be removed, and the `replace_argument` function needs to be defined or imported wherever it is being used.

The corrected code for the problematic function is:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', 'push --force')
```
