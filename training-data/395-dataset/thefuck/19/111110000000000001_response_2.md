Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the usage of `@git_support` decorator, which is not defined.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The `@git_support` decorator is not defined in the code, so when the function is called, it results in a NameError.
2. The decorator might be intended to provide some git-related functionalities, but it is missing from the code.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define the `@git_support` decorator and implement the required functionality, if it is intended to modify the behavior of the `get_new_command` function.
2. If the `@git_support` decorator is not intended to modify the behavior of the function, simply remove it and correct the function accordingly.

Corrected code:

```python
# Assuming the @git_support decorator is not needed
def get_new_command(command):
    return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', 'push --force')
```
If the `@git_support` decorator is intended to modify the behavior:
```python
# Define the @git_support decorator
def git_support(func):
    # Define the functionality of the decorator
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        # Implement the decorator's behavior here, if needed
        result = func(*args, **kwargs)
        return result
    return wrapper

# Use the @git_support decorator with the fixed function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', 'push --force')
```
