The buggy function "get_new_command" is intended to replace the argument in a command script from "push" to "push --force". However, it seems to be using a decorator called "@git_support" which is not defined in the provided code.

The error messages from the test function show that the "get_new_command" function is not producing the expected output, and is instead adding "--force" without the "--with-lease" part. This indicates that the function is not handling the command arguments correctly.

To fix the issue, the decorator "@git_support" should be removed as it is not used in the provided code. The function should then properly modify the input command by adding the "--force-with-lease" argument instead of just "--force". 

Here's the corrected function "get_new_command":

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if 'push' in command.script:
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', 'push --force-with-lease')
    else:
        return command.script
```

By making these changes, the function should now correctly modify the "git push" command to "git push --force-with-lease", as expected by the test cases.
