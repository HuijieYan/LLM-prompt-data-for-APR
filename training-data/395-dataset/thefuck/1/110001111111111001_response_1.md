The bug is likely to occur in the `get_new_command` function when trying to extract `broken_cmd` and `new_cmd` using regular expressions from the `command.output` string. The error message "IndexError: list index out of range" suggests that the regular expressions may not be finding any matches in the string, leading to an empty list and causing the IndexError when trying to access the first element.

This bug occurs because the regular expressions used to find the `broken_cmd` and `new_cmd` may not match the input string, resulting in empty lists. As a result, when trying to access the first element of these empty lists, it raises an IndexError.

To fix the bug, we should first check if the regular expressions find any matches in the `command.output` string before trying to access the elements. If no match is found, we should handle this scenario appropriately, such as providing default values or raising an error.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function, taking into account the potential bug and addressing it:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_match = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command "([a-z]+)"', command.output)
    new_cmd_match = re.findall(r'maybe you meant "([a-z]+)"', command.output)

    if broken_cmd_match and new_cmd_match:  # Check if matches were found
        broken_cmd = broken_cmd_match[0]
        new_cmd = new_cmd_match[0]

        return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        # Handle the scenario when no matches are found
        return "No matching command found"
```

In this corrected code, we first check if both `broken_cmd_match` and `new_cmd_match` lists contain any elements. If matches are found, we then proceed to extract the values. Otherwise, we handle the scenario appropriately.
