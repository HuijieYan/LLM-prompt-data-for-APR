The potential error in the provided code is with the use of regular expressions in the `get_new_command` function. The function is trying to extract the broken command and the suggested replacement command using regular expressions, but the regex patterns are not correctly capturing the desired values from the `command.output`.

The bug is occurring because the regular expressions used in the `findall` function are not matching the input `command.output` correctly. As a result, the values extracted in `broken_cmd` and `new_cmd` are not accurate.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the regular expressions to correctly capture the broken command and the suggested replacement command from the `command.output`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command "([^"]+)"', command.output)[0]
    new_cmd = re.findall(r'maybe you meant "([^"]+)"', command.output)[0]

    return command.script.replace(broken_cmd, new_cmd)
```

In the corrected code:
- We have updated the regular expressions to capture the command within the double quotes in both cases and fixed the issue of extracting the correct values.
- We have also used the `replace` function to replace the `broken_cmd` with the `new_cmd` in the `command.script`.

Now the `get_new_command` function should work correctly and return the expected results for the given test cases.
