Potential error location: The error occurs in the `get_new_command` function in the line where `broken_cmd` and `new_cmd` are obtained using `re.findall`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The use of the `re.findall` function returns a list of all occurrences that match the pattern, but the code assumes that there will always be at least one match.
2. If there are no matches for the specified regex pattern, the code will raise an `IndexError` when trying to access the first element of an empty list.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Check if there are matches for the regex pattern before trying to access the first element of the result list.
2. Handle the case where there are no matches and return an appropriate value or handle the error gracefully.

Corrected code:
```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_matches = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command "([a-z]+)"', command.output)
    new_cmd_matches = re.findall(r'maybe you meant "([a-z]+)"', command.output)

    if broken_cmd_matches and new_cmd_matches:
        broken_cmd = broken_cmd_matches[0]
        new_cmd = new_cmd_matches[0]
        return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        # Handle the case where there are no matches
        # For example, log an error message and return the original command
        print("Unable to find matching commands")
        return command.script
```
