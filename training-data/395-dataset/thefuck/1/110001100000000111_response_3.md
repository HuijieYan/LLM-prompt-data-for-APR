The error is occurring at the line `new_cmd = re.findall(r'maybe you meant \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)[0]` within the `get_new_command` function. The error message indicates that a list index is out of range, which means that the regular expression `re.findall` is not finding any matches in the `command.output`.

The possible reasons behind this bug could be:
1. The regular expression is not matching the expected string pattern in the `command.output`.
2. The format of the output has changed, causing the regular expression to no longer match.

To fix this bug, the `get_new_command` function should be updated to handle cases where `re.findall` does not find a match.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_match = re.search(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-zA-Z+]+)\"', command.stderr)
    new_match = re.search(r'maybe you meant \"([a-zA-Z+]+)\"', command.stderr)

    if broken_match and new_match:
        broken_cmd = broken_match.group(1)
        new_cmd = new_match.group(1)
        return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        return None  # handle the case where no match is found
```

In the corrected code, I've used `re.search` instead of `re.findall` to find the matches. I've also added a check to ensure that both `broken_match` and `new_match` are not None before extracting the matched groups and replacing the arguments. Additionally, I added `A-Z` to the regular expression to handle potential uppercase letters in the command names.
