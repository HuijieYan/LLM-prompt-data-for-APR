The error occurs because the `re.findall` method does not find any matches for the regular expressions in the `command.output` string, causing `IndexError` when trying to access the first element of the empty list.

There are a few potential approaches to fix this bug:
1. Check if `re.findall` returns an empty list before trying to access its index.
2. Use `re.search` instead of `re.findall` to find a single match for the regular expression.
3. Add error handling to handle cases where the regular expression match is not found.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_match = re.search(r'ERROR: unknown command "([a-z]+)"', command.output)
    new_cmd_match = re.search(r'maybe you meant "([a-z]+)"', command.output)

    if broken_cmd_match and new_cmd_match:
        broken_cmd = broken_cmd_match.group(1)
        new_cmd = new_cmd_match.group(1)

        return command.script.replace(broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        return command.script  # If no matches found, return the original script
```
