The buggy function is attempting to extract the broken command and the new command from the output using regular expressions and then replace the broken command with the new command in the command script. 

The bug occurs in the use of regular expressions to extract the broken command and the new command. The regular expressions are not matching the provided input correctly, leading to incorrect extraction of the broken command and the new command.

To fix the bug, the regular expressions used to extract the broken command and the new command need to be updated to capture the correct values from the input.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd = re.search(r'unknown command "([a-z]+)"', command.output).group(1)
    new_cmd = re.search(r'maybe you meant "([a-z]+)"', command.output).group(1)

    return command.script.replace(broken_cmd, new_cmd)
```
