Potential Error Location:
The error is occurring in the `get_new_command` function, specifically in the line where `broken_cmd` is being assigned a value using `re.findall`. The error message indicates that a list index is out of range in this line.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the regular expression used in `re.findall` is not able to match the provided input string in the `command.output`. As a result, it returns an empty list, causing the subsequent indexing operation to fail.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Validate the input string before applying the regular expression to avoid empty matches.
2. Check if the result of `re.findall` is not empty before indexing into it to avoid the `IndexError`.
3. Handle the case where the regular expression does not match the input string by returning a default value or raising an informative error.

Corrected Code:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_match = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)
    broken_cmd = broken_cmd_match[0] if broken_cmd_match else ''  # Check for empty match
    new_cmd_match = re.findall(r'maybe you meant \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)
    new_cmd = new_cmd_match[0] if new_cmd_match else ''  # Check for empty match

    return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd, new_cmd)
```

This corrected code includes checks for empty matches from the regular expressions to prevent the `IndexError`. If there are no matches, it assigns an empty string to `broken_cmd` and `new_cmd`. This ensures that the code does not fail when there are no matches for the regular expressions.
