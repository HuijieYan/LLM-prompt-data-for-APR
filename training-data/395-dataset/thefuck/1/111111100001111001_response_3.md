The buggy function is attempting to extract the "broken" and "new" commands from the `command.output` and then use them to replace an argument in the `command.script`. However, the bug seems to be in the use of the `re.findall` function. It is returning a list of matches, and the code is assuming that there will always be a match. This assumption is resulting in an `IndexError` if there is no match.

To fix this bug, we need to check if there are matches before attempting to access them. If there are no matches, we should handle that case appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_match = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)
    new_cmd_match = re.findall(r'maybe you meant \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)

    if broken_cmd_match and new_cmd_match:  # check if there are matches
        broken_cmd = broken_cmd_match[0]
        new_cmd = new_cmd_match[0]

        return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        return command.script  # return the original script if there are no matches
```

This corrected code checks if there are matches for the "broken" and "new" commands before attempting to access them. If there are no matches, it returns the original `command.script`.
