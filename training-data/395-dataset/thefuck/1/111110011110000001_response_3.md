The error message indicates that there is an "IndexError: list index out of range" occurring in the `get_new_command` function. This means that the `re.findall` method is not finding any matches in the `command.output` string, resulting in an empty list and the subsequent list index out of range error.

The potential error location in the function is the `re.findall` method, specifically in the lines:
```python
broken_cmd = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)[0]
new_cmd = re.findall(r'maybe you meant \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)[0]
```

The issue is arising because the regular expressions used in `re.findall` are not matching anything in the `command.output` string, resulting in empty lists. As a result, attempting to access the first element of these empty lists results in the IndexError.

To fix this bug, we need to handle cases where the regular expressions do not find any matches. This can be achieved by checking the length of the result of `re.findall` before trying to access its elements.

Below is the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_match = re.search(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)
    new_cmd_match = re.search(r'maybe you meant \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)

    if broken_cmd_match and new_cmd_match:
        broken_cmd = broken_cmd_match.group(1)
        new_cmd = new_cmd_match.group(1)
        return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        return "Match not found"
```

In the corrected code, we use `re.search` instead of `re.findall` to find the matches. We use `group(1)` to retrieve the captured group from the regular expression match. Additionally, we check if both matches are found before proceeding with further operations. If either match is not found, the function returns a message indicating that the match was not found.
