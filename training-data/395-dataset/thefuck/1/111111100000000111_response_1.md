Potential error location: The issue seems to be occurring in the `get_new_command` function within the `pip_unknown_command.py` file.

Reasons for the bug: The `IndexError` occurs when the regular expressions used in the `get_new_command` function are unable to find a match in the provided `command.output`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Check if the regular expressions are matching the expected patterns in the `command.output`.
2. Ensure that the `command.output` actually contains the expected error message before attempting to extract values using regular expressions.
3. Handle cases where the regular expressions might not find a match to avoid the `IndexError`.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_match = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command "([a-z]+)"', command.stderr)
    new_cmd_match = re.findall(r'maybe you meant "([a-z]+)"', command.stderr)

    if broken_cmd_match and new_cmd_match:
        broken_cmd = broken_cmd_match[0]
        new_cmd = new_cmd_match[0]
        return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        # Handle cases where the regular expressions don't find a match
        return command.script  # Or handle it in another way based on the logic of the program
```
