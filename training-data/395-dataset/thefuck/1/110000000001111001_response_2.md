The buggy function is trying to extract the broken command and its replacement from the `command.output` and then replace the broken command in `command.script` with the new command. However, the code is trying to use regular expressions without importing the `re` module. Additionally, the regular expressions used in the `findall` function are incorrect.

To fix the bug:
1. Import the `re` module to use regular expressions.
2. Change the regular expressions used in the `findall` function to correctly capture the broken command and the new command.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command "(.*?)"', command.output)[0]
    new_cmd = re.findall(r'maybe you meant "(.*?)"', command.output)[0]

    return command.script.replace(broken_cmd, new_cmd)
```
