The potential error location within the problematic function is in the use of the `re.findall` method. It seems to be incorrectly implemented, causing the code to fail.

The bug occurs because the `re.findall` method returns a list of all occurrences of the pattern in the input string, but the buggy function is attempting to access the first item directly using `[0]` without checking if there are any matches. This causes the code to throw an IndexError if there are no matches.

To fix the bug, we need to check if there are any matches before attempting to access the first item in the list. We can also simplify the code to directly replace the broken command with the new command using the `replace` method for strings.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_match = re.search(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)
    new_cmd_match = re.search(r'maybe you meant \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)

    if broken_cmd_match and new_cmd_match:
        broken_cmd = broken_cmd_match.group(1)
        new_cmd = new_cmd_match.group(1)
        return command.script.replace(broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        return command.script
```
