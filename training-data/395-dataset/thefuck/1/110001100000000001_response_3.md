Potential error location: 
The potential error is in the use of the re.findall() function. It seems like the regular expression is not correctly capturing the desired values from the command.output.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The regular expression used in re.findall() might not be matching the expected pattern in command.output, leading to an IndexError when trying to access the matched groups.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Check the pattern and the format of the command.output to ensure that it matches the regular expressions being used.
2. Add error handling to ensure that the regular expression matches are found before trying to access the matched groups.

Corrected code:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_match = re.search(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)
    new_cmd_match = re.search(r'maybe you meant \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)

    if broken_cmd_match and new_cmd_match:
        broken_cmd = broken_cmd_match.group(1)
        new_cmd = new_cmd_match.group(1)
        return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    
    return None
```
