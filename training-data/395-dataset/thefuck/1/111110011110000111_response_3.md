The error is occurring in the `get_new_command` function in the `pip_unknown_command.py` file. Specifically, the error is caused by the line:
```python
broken_cmd = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)[0]
```
This line is trying to extract the broken command from the `command.output` using a regular expression, and it's assuming that there will always be a match, which leads to the `IndexError` when there is no match.

The bug occurs because the regular expression used to find the broken command is not matching the provided `command.output`, resulting in an empty list and causing the `IndexError` when trying to access the first element.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where no match is found for the regular expression. We should check if the `re.findall` result is an empty list before trying to access its elements.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmds = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)
    new_cmds = re.findall(r'maybe you meant \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)
    
    if broken_cmds and new_cmds:
        broken_cmd = broken_cmds[0]
        new_cmd = new_cmds[0]
        return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        return None
```

In the corrected function, we first check if both `broken_cmds` and `new_cmds` are not empty, then we proceed to extract the broken and new command. If they are empty, we return `None` as there is no valid replacement.
