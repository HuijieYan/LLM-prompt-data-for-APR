The error "IndexError: list index out of range" suggests that the function is trying to access an element of a list that does not exist. Looking at the buggy function, the error occurs in the lines:
```python
broken_cmd = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)[0]
new_cmd = re.findall(r'maybe you meant \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)[0]
```
The `re.findall` method returns an empty list if no match is found, and accessing the first element of an empty list will result in an IndexError.

The bug occurs because the regular expression patterns are not matching the input correctly, leading to empty lists being returned by `re.findall`.

To fix the bug:
1. It's necessary to revise the regular expressions used in `re.findall` to ensure that they correctly extract the intended strings from `command.output`.
2. The code should also include checks to handle cases where no matches are found.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_match = re.search(r'unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)
    new_cmd_match = re.search(r'maybe you meant \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)

    if broken_cmd_match and new_cmd_match:
        broken_cmd = broken_cmd_match.group(1)
        new_cmd = new_cmd_match.group(1)
        return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        return "Command not found"  # Or handle the case appropriately based on the specific requirements
```
