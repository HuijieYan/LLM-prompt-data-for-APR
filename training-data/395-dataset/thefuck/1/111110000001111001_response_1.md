Potential error location: The potential error is in the `get_new_command` function where `re.findall` is used to extract the broken command and the new command from the `command.output` string. 

Reason for the bug: The bug is occurring because the regular expression pattern used in the `re.findall` method is not correctly capturing the command strings from the `command.output` string. 

Possible approach for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, we need to adjust the regular expression pattern used in the `re.findall` method to correctly capture the broken command and the new command.

Corrected code:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd = re.findall(r'unknown command \"([^\"]+)\"', command.output)[0]
    new_cmd = re.findall(r'maybe you meant \"([^\"]+)\"', command.output)[0]

    return command.script.replace(broken_cmd, new_cmd)
```
