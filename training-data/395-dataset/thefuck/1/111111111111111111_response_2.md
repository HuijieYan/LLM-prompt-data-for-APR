The buggy function is `get_new_command`, which is supposed to extract the `broken_cmd` (broken command) and `new_cmd` (suggested new command) from the `command.output` and then replace `broken_cmd` with `new_cmd` in `command.script`.

The bug in the function is that it directly uses `re.findall` to extract values without handling the case when the pattern is not found in the `command.output`. This results in an IndexError if the pattern is not found.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when the patterns are not found in the `command.output`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_match = re.search(r'ERROR: unknown command "([^"]+)"', command.output)
    new_cmd_match = re.search(r'maybe you meant "([^"]+)"', command.output)

    if broken_cmd_match and new_cmd_match:
        broken_cmd = broken_cmd_match.group(1)
        new_cmd = new_cmd_match.group(1)
        return command.script.replace(broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        return command.script
```

In the corrected code, we use `re.search` to find the matches for the patterns. If both patterns are found, we extract the values for `broken_cmd` and `new_cmd`. If either of the patterns is not found, we return the original `command.script`.

This handles the case when the patterns are not found in the `command.output`, avoiding the IndexError.
