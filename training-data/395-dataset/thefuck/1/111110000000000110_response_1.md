The given method has multiple issues such as missing import, missing regular expression and the incorrect variable used in the function. I have corrected the method and included all the necessary imports and used the correct variable.

```python
import re

def get_new_command(broken_cmd, new_cmd):
    return broken_cmd.replace(broken_cmd, new_cmd)
```
