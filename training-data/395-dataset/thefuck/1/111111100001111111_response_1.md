Potential error location: The error occurs at the line where the `broken_cmd` and `new_cmd` are obtained using `re.findall`. This error occurs because this function assumes that it will always find a match, but if the regex pattern does not match, it will result in an IndexError.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the code does not handle the case when the regex pattern does not match the input string. This causes the `re.findall` function to return an empty list, resulting in an IndexError when trying to access the first element of the list.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the result of `re.findall` is empty and handle this case separately to avoid the IndexError.
2. Use `re.search` instead of `re.findall` to check for a match and extract the necessary groups.

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_match = re.search(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)
    new_cmd_match = re.search(r'maybe you meant \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)

    if broken_cmd_match and new_cmd_match:
        broken_cmd = broken_cmd_match.group(1)
        new_cmd = new_cmd_match.group(1)
        return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        return command.script  # Or handle the case when no match is found
```
