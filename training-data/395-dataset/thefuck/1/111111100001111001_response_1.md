The potential error location in the problematic function is with the use of regular expressions to extract the broken and new commands from the output. It's likely that the regex patterns are not capturing the expected substrings due to incorrect syntax or inconsistencies with the input. 

The reason for the bug is that the regular expression patterns are not correctly matching the input string, leading to incorrect extraction of the broken and new commands.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the regular expression patterns to ensure they capture the desired substrings correctly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd = re.findall(r'unknown command "([^"]+)"', command.output)[0]
    new_cmd = re.findall(r'maybe you meant "([^"]+)"', command.output)[0]

    return command.script.replace(broken_cmd, new_cmd)
```
