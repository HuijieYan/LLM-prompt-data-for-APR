The potential error in the provided function is with the usage of the `replace_argument` function, which is not defined in the given code. Additionally, there is no import statement for the `re` module, indicating that it is missing from the code.

The bug occurs because the `re` module is not imported, and the `replace_argument` function is not defined.

To fix the bug, you need to import the `re` module and define the `replace_argument` function. Additionally, the use of regular expressions in the `re.findall` function needs to be adjusted to the input format of the `command.output` string.

```python
import re

# Fix the buggy function
def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd = re.findall(r'"(.*?)"', command.output)[0]  # extracting the unknown command using a regular expression
    new_cmd = re.findall(r'meant "(.*?)"', command.output)[0]  # extracting the suggested command using a regular expression
    
    updated_script = command.script.replace(broken_cmd, new_cmd)  # replacing the broken command with the new command in the script

    class Command:  # defining a simple Command class for demonstration purposes
        def __init__(self, script, output):
            self.script = script
            self.output = output

    return Command(script=updated_script, output=f'Updated command: {updated_script}')
```

This corrected code will extract the unknown and suggested commands from the `command.output` string using regular expressions and then replace the unknown command with the suggested command in the script. The function returns the updated script within a new Command object along with the output message.
