Potential error location: The error occurs on the line `broken_cmd = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)[0]` in the `get_new_command` function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: 
- The error is occurring because the `re.findall` function returns a list of matches, and accessing the first element of the list using `[0]` without checking if any matches were found can lead to an `IndexError` if the list is empty.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Check if the `re.findall` function returns any matches before accessing the first element of the list.
- If no matches are found, handle the case by providing a default value or raising an error.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_matches = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)
    new_cmd_matches = re.findall(r'maybe you meant \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)

    if broken_cmd_matches and new_cmd_matches:
        broken_cmd = broken_cmd_matches[0]
        new_cmd = new_cmd_matches[0]
        return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        # Handle the case where no matches are found
        return ""  # Return a default value or raise an error as per requirement
```
