The error is occurring because the regular expression used in the `get_new_command` function is not able to find a match in the given input string, resulting in an empty list being returned.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The regular expressions used may not be able to handle all possible variations in the input command output.
2. The `get_new_command` function does not handle the scenario where a match is not found for the regular expressions.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the regular expressions to make them more flexible and able to handle different variations in the input command output.
2. Add error-handling to check if a match is found before attempting to access the first element of the result.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_match = re.search(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z+\-\s]+)\"', command.output)
    new_cmd_match = re.search(r'maybe you meant \"([a-z+\-\s]+)\"', command.output)
    
    if broken_cmd_match and new_cmd_match:
        broken_cmd = broken_cmd_match.group(1)
        new_cmd = new_cmd_match.group(1)
        return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        # handle scenario where match is not found
        return command.script
```
