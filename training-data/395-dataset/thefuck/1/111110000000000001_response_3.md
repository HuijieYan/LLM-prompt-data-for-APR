The potential error location within the function is in the use of the `re.findall` method without importing the `re` module.

The bug occurred because the function is trying to use the `re` module to find matches in the command output without actually importing the module. This results in a `NameError` when the function is called.

To fix this bug, we need to import the `re` module at the beginning of the file where the function is defined.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"',
                            command.output)[0]
    new_cmd = re.findall(r'maybe you meant \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)[0]

    return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd, new_cmd)
```
