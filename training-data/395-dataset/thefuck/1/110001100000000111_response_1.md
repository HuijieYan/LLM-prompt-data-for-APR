Potential error location: The error is occurring in the `get_new_command` function in the file `pip_unknown_command.py`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The error is due to the `IndexError` caused by the `re.findall` method not finding any matches in the `command.output`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: It's important to first check if the `re.findall` method is able to find any matches before accessing the first element of the result. This can be done by checking the length of the list returned by `re.findall` before attempting to access its elements.

Corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_match = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.stderr)
    new_cmd_match = re.findall(r'maybe you meant \"([a-z]+)\"', command.stderr)

    broken_cmd = broken_cmd_match[0] if broken_cmd_match else ""
    new_cmd = new_cmd_match[0] if new_cmd_match else ""

    return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd, new_cmd)
```

In the corrected code, we use the `if` condition to check if there are matches before accessing the elements of the list returned by `re.findall`. If there are no matches, empty strings are assigned to `broken_cmd` and `new_cmd`. This will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.
