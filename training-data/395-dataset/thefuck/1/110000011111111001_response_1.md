The bug is occurring because the regular expression `re.findall` is not finding a match in the `command.output` for the given pattern, causing an IndexError when trying to access index 0 of the result.

To fix this bug, we can first check if there is a match before trying to access the first element of the result. If a match is found, we can then proceed to access the matched groups.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_match = re.search(r'ERROR: unknown command "([a-z]+)"', command.output)
    if broken_cmd_match:
        broken_cmd = broken_cmd_match.group(1)
    else:
        # Handle the case when there is no match for the pattern
        return command.script

    new_cmd_match = re.search(r'maybe you meant "([a-z]+)"', command.output)
    if new_cmd_match:
        new_cmd = new_cmd_match.group(1)
    else:
        # Handle the case when there is no match for the pattern
        return command.script

    return command.script.replace(broken_cmd, new_cmd)
```

This corrected code first uses `re.search` to find the matches and then checks if a match is found before accessing the matched groups. If no match is found, it returns the original `command.script`.

This approach ensures that we avoid IndexError and accurately handle cases where no match is found for the regular expression patterns.
