Potential error location:
The error is occurring at the line `broken_cmd = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)[0]` in the `get_new_command` function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The error is occurring because the regular expression used in `re.findall` is not matching the pattern in the `command.output`. As a result, the `re.findall` function is returning an empty list, and when we try to access the first element of the empty list using `[0]`, it results in a `IndexError: list index out of range`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the regular expressions used in `re.findall` are correctly capturing the expected patterns in the `command.output`.
2. Add error handling to handle cases where the regular expression does not match any patterns in the `command.output`, such as checking if the result of `re.findall` is empty before trying to access the first element.

Corrected code:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_matches = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command "([a-z]+)"', command.output)
    new_cmd_matches = re.findall(r'maybe you meant "([a-z]+)"', command.output)
    
    if broken_cmd_matches and new_cmd_matches:
        broken_cmd = broken_cmd_matches[0]
        new_cmd = new_cmd_matches[0]
        return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        return None  # Handle the case where the regular expression matches are not found
```
