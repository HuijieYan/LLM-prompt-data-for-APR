The bug in the provided function `get_new_command` is caused by the use of regular expression `re.findall` without checking if the match is found. In the case where no match is found, `re.findall` returns an empty list, and trying to access the first element of that list (`[0]`) results in the `IndexError: list index out of range`.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to first check if any matches are found before accessing the first element.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re

class Command:
    def __init__(self, script, output):
        self.script = script
        self.output = output

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_match = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)
    new_cmd_match = re.findall(r'maybe you meant \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)

    if broken_cmd_match and new_cmd_match:
        broken_cmd = broken_cmd_match[0]
        new_cmd = new_cmd_match[0]
        return command.script.replace(broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        return command.script  # return original command if no matches found
```

This corrected function first checks if the matches are found using `if broken_cmd_match and new_cmd_match` and then accesses the first elements of the respective matches (`broken_cmd_match[0]` and `new_cmd_match[0]`) if they exist. If no matches are found, it simply returns the original command. This implementation handles the potential IndexError and ensures the function works as expected.
