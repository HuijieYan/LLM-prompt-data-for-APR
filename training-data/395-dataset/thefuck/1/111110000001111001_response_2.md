The buggy function is trying to extract the "broken_cmd" and "new_cmd" from the "command.output" and then replace "broken_cmd" with "new_cmd" in "command.script". However, the function is using the re.findall() method incorrectly to extract the values. The regex pattern and the way the values are being extracted are causing the issue.

The error is occurring because the regex patterns are not matching the input string properly. The regex patterns need to be adjusted to correctly capture the required values.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the regex patterns and the way we extract the values from the "command.output".

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd = re.search(r'ERROR: unknown command "(.*?)"', command.output).group(1)
    new_cmd = re.search(r'maybe you meant "(.*?)"', command.output).group(1)

    return command.script.replace(broken_cmd, new_cmd)
```
