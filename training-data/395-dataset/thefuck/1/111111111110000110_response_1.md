The problem with the `get_new_command` function is that the `re.findall` function is not returning any matches for both the `broken_cmd` and `new_cmd`. We can fix this issue by checking the length of the result from `re.findall` to prevent subscripting an empty list, which is causing the `IndexError`. 

Here's the fixed function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmds = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"',
                             command.output)
    new_cmds = re.findall(r'maybe you meant \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)

    if broken_cmds and new_cmds:
        return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmds[0], new_cmds[0])
    else:
        return command.script
```

By checking for non-empty `broken_cmds` and `new_cmds` before accessing the first item in the list, we prevent the `IndexError`. If the list is empty, the original `command.script` is returned.
