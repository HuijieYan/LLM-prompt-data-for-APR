The potential error in the provided function `get_new_command` is in the `re.findall` method calls. The error message `IndexError: list index out of range` occurs because the regular expressions used in the `re.findall` calls are not matching the provided `command.output`, leading to an empty list and causing the indexing error when trying to access the first element.

The issue occurs because the regular expressions are not correctly capturing the expected values.

To fix this bug, the regular expressions need to be adjusted to correctly capture the values of `broken_cmd` and `new_cmd` from the `command.output`.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function using updated regular expressions:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command "([a-z+]+)"', command.output)
    new_cmd = re.findall(r'maybe you meant "([a-z]+)"', command.output)

    if not broken_cmd or not new_cmd:
        return command.script  # Return the original script if the values are not found

    return command.script.replace(broken_cmd[0], new_cmd[0])
```

By updating the regular expressions and handling the cases where the values are not found, we can avoid the IndexError and return the corrected command script.
