The error occurs in the `get_new_command` function, particularly in the `get_new_command` method of the `pip_unknown_command.py` rule. The error is due to an IndexError, which suggests that the `re.findall` method is not finding any matches for the regular expression pattern.

The reason for this error is that the regular expression pattern is not correctly matching the expected output in some cases. It seems that the regular expression pattern is not able to handle specific characters, such as `+`, in the command output.

To fix this bug, we need to update the regular expression pattern to properly handle potential special characters and match the expected output.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` method:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_match = re.search(r'ERROR: unknown command "(.*?)"', command.output)
    new_cmd_match = re.search(r'maybe you meant "(.*?)"', command.output)

    if broken_cmd_match and new_cmd_match:
        broken_cmd = broken_cmd_match.group(1)
        new_cmd = new_cmd_match.group(1)
        return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        return None  # handle the case where no matches are found
```

In this corrected code:
- We are using `re.search` instead of `re.findall` to find the first match of the regular expression patterns.
- We are capturing the matched groups using the `group(1)` method to extract the broken and new commands.
- We are also handling the case where no matches are found and returning `None` in that case.
