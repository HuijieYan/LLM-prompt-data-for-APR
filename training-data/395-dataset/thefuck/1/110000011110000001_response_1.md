The bug is located in the `get_new_command` function. The `IndexError` is being raised on the line `broken_cmd = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)[0]`. This means that the `re.findall` method is not finding any matches in `command.output` and thus the list returned is empty.

The reason for this bug is that the regular expression pattern is not matching the input `command.output`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the regular expressions to match the input correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_match = re.search(r'unknown command "([a-z+]+)"', command.output)
    suggested_cmd_match = re.search(r'maybe you meant "([a-z]+)"', command.output)

    if broken_cmd_match and suggested_cmd_match:
        broken_cmd = broken_cmd_match.group(1)
        new_cmd = suggested_cmd_match.group(1)
        return command.script.replace(broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        return command.script
```
