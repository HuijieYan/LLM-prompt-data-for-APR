The buggy function attempts to extract the broken command and the new command from the `command.output` string and then replace the broken command with the new command in `command.script`. 

The issue with the implementation is that the regular expressions used to extract the broken command and the new command are not handling the string containing the command and its potential replacements properly.

To fix the bug, we need to change the regular expressions used in the `findall` calls to correctly extract the broken command and the new command from the `command.output` string.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd = re.findall(r'unknown command "(.*?)"', command.output)[0]
    new_cmd = re.findall(r'maybe you meant "(.*?)"', command.output)[0]

    return command.script.replace(broken_cmd, new_cmd)
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly extract the broken and new commands using the regular expressions and replace the broken command with the new command in the `command.script`.
