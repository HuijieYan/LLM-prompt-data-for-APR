Potential error: The `re` module is used, but it's not imported in the code.

Reason for the bug: The code tries to use the `re` module to find patterns in the `command.output`, but the `re` module is not imported, so the code will throw an error.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Import the `re` module at the beginning of the file to use its functions.

Corrected code:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"',
                            command.output)[0]
    new_cmd = re.findall(r'maybe you meant \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)[0]

    return command.script.replace(broken_cmd, new_cmd)
```
