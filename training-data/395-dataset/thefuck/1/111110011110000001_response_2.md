The error seems to occur at line 16 when attempting to access index 0 of the list returned by `re.findall`. This error message suggests that the regex pattern is not matching the `command.output` string, resulting in an empty list. As a result, trying to access index 0 of an empty list causes the `IndexError: list index out of range`. 

To fix this bug, the regex patterns used in `findall` should be modified or the handling of the returned list should be changed to account for the possibility of an empty list.

Updated code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmd_match = re.search(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)
    new_cmd_match = re.search(r'maybe you meant \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)

    if broken_cmd_match and new_cmd_match:
        broken_cmd = broken_cmd_match.group(1)
        new_cmd = new_cmd_match.group(1)

        return command.script.replace(broken_cmd, new_cmd)

    return command.script
```

This updated function uses `re.search` instead of `re.findall` to search for the patterns in the `command.output` string. It also checks if the matches are found before accessing the groups to prevent potential `IndexError`. If matches are found, it replaces the `broken_cmd` with the `new_cmd` in the `command.script` and returns the modified script. If no matches are found, the original `command.script` is returned.
