The error is occurring because the regular expression `re.findall` is not finding any matches in the `command.output` string. This is leading to a `IndexError` when trying to access index 0 of the result list.

The potential error location is the `re.findall` function, where it fails to find any matches based on the provided regular expression.

The reason behind the bug is that the regular expression is not able to match the pattern in the `command.output` string, causing the `re.findall` function to return an empty list, leading to the `IndexError` when trying to access index 0 of the empty list.

To fix the bug, we need to update the regular expressions to capture the correct patterns found in the `command.output` string. Additionally, we should handle the case where no matches are found to avoid the `IndexError`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_matches = re.findall(r'"([a-z]+)"', command.output)
    if len(broken_matches) >= 2:
        broken_cmd = broken_matches[0]
        new_cmd = broken_matches[1]
        return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        return command.script
```
