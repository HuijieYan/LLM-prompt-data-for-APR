The error occurs in the `get_new_command` function, specifically in the line `broken_cmd = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)[0]`. The error message indicates that the list index is out of range, which means that `re.findall` did not find any matches in `command.output`.

The potential reason for the bug is that the regular expression pattern may not be matching the `command.output` string, which causes `re.findall` to return an empty list. As a result, accessing the first element of the empty list using index `[0]` raises the `IndexError`.

To fix the bug, the regular expression pattern needs to be adjusted to ensure that it correctly matches the desired part of the `command.output` string. Additionally, error handling should be added to handle cases where `re.findall` returns an empty list.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_match = re.search(r'ERROR: unknown command "([a-z]+)"', command.output)
    new_match = re.search(r'maybe you meant "([a-z]+)"', command.output)

    if broken_match and new_match:
        broken_cmd = broken_match.group(1)
        new_cmd = new_match.group(1)
        return command.script.replace(broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        # Handle the case where the expected patterns are not found in command.output
        return command.script
```
