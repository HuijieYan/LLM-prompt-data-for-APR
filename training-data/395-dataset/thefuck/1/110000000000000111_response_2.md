Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is in the `get_new_command` function, specifically in the lines involving `re.findall` and `replace_argument`.

Reasons Behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `re.findall` function may not find a match for the specified pattern in the `command.output`. This leads to an empty list, and subsequently, when trying to access the first element of this empty list, it results in a "list index out of range" error.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Before accessing the first element of the result from `re.findall`, it's important to check if the list is not empty to avoid the "list index out of range" error.
2. Additionally, it's important to handle cases where the specified pattern is not found in the `command.output`.

Corrected Code:
```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    broken_cmds = re.findall(r'ERROR: unknown command \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)
    new_cmds = re.findall(r'maybe you meant \"([a-z]+)\"', command.output)

    if broken_cmds and new_cmds:
        broken_cmd = broken_cmds[0]
        new_cmd = new_cmds[0]
        return replace_argument(command.script, broken_cmd, new_cmd)
    else:
        # handle cases where the specified patterns are not found in command.output
        return "No replacement found"  # or any desired return value
```
