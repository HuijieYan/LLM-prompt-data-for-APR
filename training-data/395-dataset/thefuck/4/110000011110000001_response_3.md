The error message indicates that there is a ValueError in the _get_aliases function. Specifically, the error occurs during the splitting of the alias string. The function is trying to split the alias string based on a space (split(' ', 1)), but it encounters a situation where there is only one value after replacing 'alias ' with an empty string.

This issue occurs because some of the alias strings may not follow the expected format where there is a space between the alias name and the value. To fix this, a check for the number of resulting items after the split operation should be performed before attempting to unpack the split values.

Here's the corrected code for the _get_aliases function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def cache(config_file):
    def wrapper(fn):
        def inner(*args, **kwargs):
            return fn(*args, **kwargs)
        return inner
    return wrapper

def _get_aliases(overridden):
    aliases = {}
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-ic', 'alias'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    alias_out = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split('\n')
    for alias in alias_out:
        # Ensure that the alias string contains both name and value
        if 'alias ' in alias:
            name, value = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)
            if name not in overridden:
                aliases[name] = value
    return aliases
```

In this corrected code, a check for the presence of 'alias ' in the alias string is added before attempting to split the string. This ensures that only valid alias strings with both name and value are processed, thereby preventing the ValueError encountered in the original code.
