The error occurs in the `_get_aliases` function, specifically at the line `name, value = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)`. The error message indicates "ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)", which means that the unpacking operation is expecting two values but is receiving only one. This suggests that some of the alias commands may not follow the expected pattern of "alias name value" and instead have a different format.

To fix this issue, we can modify the code to handle aliases with an equal sign (`=`) as the separator between the name and the value. This will allow the function to correctly extract the alias name and value regardless of the separator used.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_aliases` function:

```python
import re
import shlex

@cache('~/.config/fish/config.fish')
def _get_aliases(overridden):
    aliases = {}
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-ic', 'alias'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    alias_out = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split('\n')
    for alias in alias_out:
        if '=' in alias:
            name, value = re.split(r'\s*=\s*', alias, 1)
        else:
            name, value = shlex.split(alias.replace('alias ', '', 1))
        if name not in overridden:
            aliases[name] = value
    return aliases
```

In the corrected code, we utilize the `re.split` method to split the alias command using the equal sign (`=`) as the separator if it is present. If the equal sign isn't present, we use `shlex.split` to split the alias command, which safely handles white spaces within quoted strings. This approach allows us to handle different alias formats and extract the name and value correctly.
