The error is occurring at the line where the `split` method is being used on the variable `alias`. This method is expecting at least two elements to split, but in this case, it's only finding one, hence the error "not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)". This error is likely occurring because the alias 'alias_with_equal_sign' is being split using the space as a delimiter, but there is no space due to the format 'alias_with_equal_sign=echo'.

To fix this issue, we can modify the split condition to use '=' as the delimiter in cases where the alias uses the format 'alias_with_equal_sign=echo'.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_aliases` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def cache(cache_path):
    def _cache(*args, **kwargs):
        pass
    return _cache

def _get_aliases(overridden):
    aliases = {}
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-ic', 'alias'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    alias_out = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split('\n')
    for alias in alias_out:
        if 'alias ' in alias:
            name_value_split = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)
            if len(name_value_split) == 2:
                name, value = name_value_split
            else:
                name, value = name_value_split[0], ''
            if name not in overridden:
                aliases[name] = value
    return aliases
```

This code includes an additional check to see if 'alias ' is present in the string before trying to split it. It then splits based on the first space it finds or no space in the case of 'alias_with_equal_sign=echo'. If there is no space, it assigns an empty string to the value.
