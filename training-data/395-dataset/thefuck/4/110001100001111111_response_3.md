The error message "ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)" indicates that the split operation in the _get_aliases function is expecting two values to unpack, but it's only receiving one. This means that the alias.split(' ', 1) is not returning the expected results.

The potential error location is in the line "name, value = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)" inside the for loop in the _get_aliases function.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the split operation is not finding the expected separator ' ' in some of the alias strings, causing it to return a list with only one element.

To fix the bug, we can modify the split operation to handle cases where the separator is either ' ' or '='. This will ensure that we always have two values to unpack.

Here's the corrected code for the _get_aliases function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def _get_aliases(overridden):
    aliases = {}
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-ic', 'alias'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    alias_out = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split('\n')
    for alias in alias_out:
        if 'alias' in alias:
            alias = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1)
            if ' ' in alias:
                name, value = alias.split(' ', 1)
            elif '=' in alias:
                name, value = alias.split('=', 1)

            if name not in overridden:
                aliases[name] = value
    return aliases
```

In this corrected code, we check if the alias contains ' ' or '=', and then use the corresponding split operation to extract the name and value. This ensures that we always have two values to unpack, resolving the "ValueError: not enough values to unpack" issue.
