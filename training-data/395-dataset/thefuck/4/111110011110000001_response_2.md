Potential Error Location:
The error is occurring at the line `name, value = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)`. It seems that the split operation is not working as expected.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The error is occurring because the `alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)` is not returning the expected number of values to unpack into `name` and `value`.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. It's possible that the `split()` method is not working as expected. We can check the output of `alias.replace('alias ', '', 1)` to ensure that it provides the expected format for splitting.
2. If the output of `alias.replace('alias ', '', 1)` is not as expected, we can try using a different approach to extract the `name` and `value` from the `alias`.

Corrected Code:
```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def _get_aliases(overridden):
    aliases = {}
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-ic', 'alias'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    alias_out = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split('\n')
    for alias in alias_out:
        alias_parts = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)
        if len(alias_parts) == 2:
            name, value = alias_parts
            if name not in overridden:
                aliases[name] = value
    return aliases
```
In the corrected code:
- I have added a check to ensure that there are exactly two parts obtained after splitting the `alias` string. If not, the alias will not be added to the `aliases` dictionary.
- This ensures that each alias is split into `name` and `value` correctly, avoiding the "ValueError: not enough values to unpack" error.
