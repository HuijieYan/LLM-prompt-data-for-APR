The error occurs when the `_get_aliases` function tries to split the `alias` string using the space character, expecting two values (name and value), but only receiving one value. This causes a `ValueError` since the split operation does not provide the expected number of values.

To fix this bug:
1. Modify the split operation to handle `=` as well as space as the separator to ensure that aliases with an equal sign are also split correctly.
2. Update the code to handle cases where the alias does not follow the expected format.

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_4/thefuck/shells/fish.py
def _get_aliases(overridden):
    aliases = {}
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-ic', 'alias'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    alias_out = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split('\n')
    for alias in alias_out:
        if alias.startswith('alias '):
            alias = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1)
            if ' ' in alias:
                name, value = alias.split(' ', 1)
            elif '=' in alias:
                name, value = alias.split('=', 1)
            else:
                # Handle unexpected alias formats
                continue
            
            if name not in overridden:
                aliases[name] = value
    return aliases
```

In the updated code, we first check if the alias starts with 'alias '. Then, we attempt to split the alias using both space and '=' as separators. If the alias does not match either format, it is skipped. This addresses the issue of not enough values to unpack in the alias split operation and handles variations in alias formats.
