The error message "ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)" suggests that there is an issue with the line that tries to split the alias into name and value. This error occurs when the string does not contain the expected number of values to unpack.

Looking at the code, the line that splits the alias into name and value is:

```python
name, value = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)
```

The error occurs because some aliases may not have a space after the 'alias' keyword, resulting in only one value being present after the split operation.

To fix this, we need to handle cases where there is no space after the 'alias' keyword and modify the splitting logic accordingly.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def _get_aliases(overridden):
    aliases = {}
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-ic', 'alias'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    alias_out = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split('\n')
    for alias in alias_out:
        alias = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1)
        if ' ' in alias:
            name, value = alias.split(' ', 1)
            if name not in overridden:
                aliases[name] = value
    return aliases
```

In the corrected code, we use the `lru_cache` decorator to cache the results of the function for better performance. We also handle the case where there is no space after the 'alias' keyword by checking if a space exists in the alias before splitting it into name and value. If a space exists, the alias is split and added to the aliases dictionary. If no space exists, it is skipped.
