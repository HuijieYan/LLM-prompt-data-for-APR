The error "ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)" indicates that the splitting of the alias is not happening properly. The splitting is expected to result in two values (name and value), but in this case, only one value is being obtained.

The potential error location within the function is the line:
```python
name, value = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the split operation is not able to find the expected delimiter (' ') in the string 'alias_with_equal_sign=echo', resulting in only one value being returned.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the splitting operation to handle the case where the expected delimiter (' ') is not found. This can be done by first checking if the string contains the separator ('=') and then splitting accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected function
def _get_aliases(overridden):
    aliases = {}
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-ic', 'alias'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    alias_out = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split('\n')
    for alias in alias_out:
        if 'alias ' in alias:
            alias = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1)
            if '=' in alias:
                name, value = alias.split('=', 1)
            else:
                name, value = alias.split(' ', 1)
            if name not in overridden:
                aliases[name] = value
    return aliases
```

In this corrected code, I added a check to see if the 'alias' string contains '='. If it does, the string is split using '=', otherwise, it is split using ' '. This modification should handle cases where the alias format includes an '=' sign.
