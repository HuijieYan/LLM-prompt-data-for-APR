The error message indicates a "ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)" at line 25 in the _get_aliases function. This suggests that the line `name, value = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)` is causing the issue.

The reason for this error is that the split function is not finding a space in the alias string, resulting in only one value being returned, which cannot be unpacked into name and value.

To fix this bug, the function needs to handle the case where there is no space in the alias string. This can be achieved by checking if there is a space before attempting to split the string, and if not, setting the value to an empty string.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def _get_aliases(overridden):
    aliases = {}
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-ic', 'alias'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    alias_out = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split('\n')
    for alias in alias_out:
        if ' ' in alias:
            name, value = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)
        else:
            name, value = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1), ''
        if name not in overridden:
            aliases[name] = value
    return aliases
```

This corrected function handles the case where there is no space in the alias string, preventing the ValueError from occurring.
