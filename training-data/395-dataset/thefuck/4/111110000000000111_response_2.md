Potential Error Location:
The error is occurring in the _get_aliases function within the line: 
name, value = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)

Reasons Behind the Bug:
The error message "ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)" indicates that the split function is not returning the expected number of items. This could be because there are aliases that do not have a space character after the alias name, causing the split function to return a single string instead of a tuple with two elements.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
One possible approach to fix this bug is to handle the case where the alias name and its value are not separated by a space character. This can be done by checking if the split result contains exactly two elements, and if not, consider the whole string as the alias name and assign an empty string as its value.

Corrected Code:
```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def _get_aliases(overridden):
    aliases = {}
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-ic', 'alias'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    alias_out = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split('\n')
    for alias in alias_out:
        if 'alias ' in alias:
            name, value = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)
            if name not in overridden:
                aliases[name] = value
        else:
            aliases[alias] = ''
    return aliases
```
