The bug in the provided code is that it is using a decorator `@cache('~/.config/fish/config.fish')` which is not a standard Python decorator. This is causing a syntax error.

To fix the code, we can remove the decorator and modify the function to explicitly handle caching if required.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import os
import pickle
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def _get_aliases(overridden):
    cache_filename = '~/.config/fish/config.pkl'
    
    if os.path.exists(cache_filename):
        with open(cache_filename, 'rb') as file:
            aliases = pickle.load(file)
    else:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-ic', 'alias'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        alias_out = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split('\n')
        aliases = {}
        
        for alias in alias_out:
            if 'alias ' in alias:
                name, value = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)
                if name not in overridden:
                    aliases[name] = value
        
        with open(cache_filename, 'wb') as file:
            pickle.dump(aliases, file)
    
    return aliases
```

In this corrected code, we explicitly handle caching by checking if a pickle file exists. If it does, we load the aliases from the file. If it doesn't exist, we run the command to get the aliases and then save the result to the file for future use. This approach ensures that the function only needs to fetch the aliases from the subprocess when the cache doesn't exist or is outdated.
