The error occurs in the line `name, value = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)` within the `_get_aliases` function. This error is caused by the assumption that the output of `alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)` will always contain two elements. However, this assumption is not necessarily true, as an alias might not always have a space-separated value. 

To fix this issue, a conditional check should be implemented to account for aliases without a value. This can be achieved by splitting the alias output and checking its length. If the length is 2, assign the two values to name and value. If the length is 1, assign the first value to name and an empty string to value.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@cache('~/.config/fish/config.fish')
def _get_aliases(overridden):
    aliases = {}
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-ic', 'alias'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    alias_out = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split('\n')
    for alias in alias_out:
        parts = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)
        if len(parts) == 2:
            name, value = parts
        else:
            name, value = parts[0], ''
        if name not in overridden:
            aliases[name] = value
    return aliases
```

This corrected code handles both cases where an alias has a value and where it does not, preventing the ValueError that was occurring.
