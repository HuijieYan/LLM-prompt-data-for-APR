The test case is asserting the output of `shell.get_aliases()` which is expected to be a dictionary of aliases. The error message indicates a `ValueError` occurring at line 25 of the `fish.py` file, where the code is attempting to unpack values from the alias.

The potential error occurs when splitting the `alias` into `name` and `value` at line 25 of the `fish.py` file. It seems that some aliases do not have a space-separated value, which causes the `split` method to fail.

The `alias` command output in Fish shell might contain aliases without a space-separated value. When trying to split such aliases into `name` and `value`, the `split` method fails due to the absence of a space, resulting in a `ValueError`.

A possible approach to fix this bug is to check whether the alias contains a space before attempting to split it. If it does, then split it into `name` and `value`; otherwise, consider the entire alias as the `name` and assign an empty string as the `value`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_aliases` function:

```python
def _get_aliases(overridden):
    aliases = {}
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-ic', 'alias'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    alias_out = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split('\n')
    for alias in alias_out:
        alias_parts = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)
        if len(alias_parts) == 2:
            name, value = alias_parts
        else:  # handle aliases without a space-separated value
            name = alias_parts[0]
            value = ''
        if name not in overridden:
            aliases[name] = value
    return aliases
```
This code checks if the alias contains a space-separated value before splitting, and if not, it handles the alias accordingly.
