The error message indicates that there is a ValueError in the _get_aliases function at line 25 of the fish.py file. The error occurs when the code tries to split an alias into name and value, but it only gets one value, causing a ValueError.

The reason for this error is that the alias parsing logic is assuming that all aliases have a name and a value separated by a space after replacing 'alias '. However, some aliases might have complex values with spaces, causing the split to fail.

To fix this bug, we can modify the alias parsing logic to handle aliases with complex values. We can split the alias string once on the first occurrence of a space after replacing 'alias ' and store the first part as the name, and the rest as the value.

Here's the corrected code for the _get_aliases function:

```python
def _get_aliases(overridden):
    aliases = {}
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-ic', 'alias'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    alias_out = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split('\n')
    for alias in alias_out:
        alias = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1)
        equal_sign_index = alias.find('=')
        if equal_sign_index != -1:
            name = alias[:equal_sign_index].strip()
            value = alias[equal_sign_index + 1:].strip()
            if name not in overridden:
                aliases[name] = value
    return aliases
```

In this corrected code, we find the index of '=' in the alias string. If it exists, we split the string into name and value accordingly. This modification allows us to handle aliases with complex values and resolves the ValueError that was occurring.
