The error occurs when the function `_get_aliases` tries to split the `alias` string into `name` and `value` using the space character as a separator. However, in the case where the string does not contain a space character or has fewer than expected values after splitting, it raises a `ValueError`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the line where the splitting occurs to handle cases where the expected values are not found. We can also make the function more robust by handling potential errors that might occur during the `Popen` call and its subsequent operations, such as decoding the output.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_aliases` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from functools import wraps
import os

def cache(filename):
    def decorator(fn):
        @wraps(fn)
        def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
            if os.path.exists(filename):
                with open(filename, 'r') as f:
                    return f.read()
            else:
                result = fn(*args, **kwargs)
                with open(filename, 'w') as f:
                    f.write(result)
                return result
        return wrapper
    return decorator

@cache('~/.config/fish/config.fish')
def _get_aliases(overridden):
    aliases = {}
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-ic', 'alias'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        alias_out = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip().split('\n')

        for alias in alias_out:
            split_alias = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ')
            if len(split_alias) > 1:
                name, value = split_alias[0], ' '.join(split_alias[1:])
                if name not in overridden:
                    aliases[name] = value
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
    return aliases
```

In the corrected code:
- We wrapped the `_get_aliases` function with a `cache` decorator that will check for a cached file and use its content if it exists, or recompute and save it otherwise.
- We added a `try-except` block to handle potential errors during the subprocess call and its subsequent operations.
- We modified the splitting logic to ensure that it can handle cases where the expected values are not found after splitting.

These changes should address the `ValueError` and improve the robustness of the function.
