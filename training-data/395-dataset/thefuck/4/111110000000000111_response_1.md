The error occurs because the function `_get_aliases` is being used as a cache and the decorator `@cache` on top of it is not working properly. The error `ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)` indicates that the split operation in the _get_aliases function is expecting two values but getting only one, which means the alias string does not have the expected format.

To fix this issue, we should remove the @cache decorator and directly call the _get_aliases function. This will ensure that the function is called every time and we do not reuse any old cached value. Also, we need to handle the case where there might not be a space in the alias string before splitting it.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_aliases(overridden):
    aliases = {}
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-ic', 'alias'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    alias_out = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split('\n')
    for alias in alias_out:
        alias_parts = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)
        if len(alias_parts) == 2:
            name, value = alias_parts
            if name not in overridden:
                aliases[name] = value
    return aliases
```
