The error message "ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)" indicates that the function _get_aliases is trying to unpack a value but it is receiving only one value, causing the ValueError. This is likely happening in the line "name, value = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)".

The reason behind the bug is that the alias.split(' ', 1) function is not splitting the value into two parts, which is expected by the unpacking operation. This could be due to the fact that some aliases do not have spaces, so the split function is not working as intended.

To fix this bug, we can add a check to see if there is a space in the alias before attempting to split it. If there is no space, we can assume that the entire value is the alias name and set the value to an empty string.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from thefuck.utils import cache

@cache('~/.config/fish/config.fish')
def _get_aliases(overridden):
    aliases = {}
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-ic', 'alias'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    alias_out = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split('\n')
    for alias in alias_out:
        if ' ' in alias:
            name, value = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)
        else:
            name = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1)
            value = ""
        if name not in overridden:
            aliases[name] = value
    return aliases
```

In this corrected code, we check if there is a space in the alias before trying to split it. If there is a space, we split the alias into name and value. If there is no space, we assume the entire value is the alias name and set the value to an empty string. This ensures that the unpacking operation in the original code does not encounter the ValueError.
