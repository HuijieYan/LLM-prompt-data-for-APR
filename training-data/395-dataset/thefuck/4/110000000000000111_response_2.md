The error is occurring within the `_get_aliases` function, specifically at the line where the `name, value = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)` statement is located.

The error message `ValueError: not enough values to unpack (expected 2, got 1)` indicates that the `split` method is not returning two values as expected, leading to a ValueError when trying to unpack them into `name` and `value`.

This could occur if the `alias` string does not contain a space, and therefore the `split` method only returns one value.

To fix this, we can modify the code to first check if the `alias` string contains a space before attempting to split it. If not, we can handle it accordingly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import os
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def cache(filepath):
    # Decorator function implementation here
    pass

def _get_aliases(overridden):
    aliases = {}
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-ic', 'alias'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    alias_out = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split('\n')
    for alias in alias_out:
        name_value = alias.replace('alias ', '', 1).split(' ', 1)
        if len(name_value) == 2:
            name, value = name_value
            if name not in overridden:
                aliases[name] = value
    return aliases
```

In the corrected code, we store the result of the split operation in `name_value` and then check the length of the result. If it contains two values, we unpack them into `name` and `value`. Otherwise, we handle it accordingly and move on to the next alias. This will prevent the ValueError from occurring when there is only one value to unpack.
