The buggy function is `_get_overridden_aliases` which is expected to return a list of overridden aliases. The function checks the value of the environment variable `TF_OVERRIDDEN_ALIASES` and splits it to create the list of aliases. The bug seems to be related to the incorrect split or handling of the `TF_OVERRIDDEN_ALIASES` variable.

The test case provides a set of expected overridden aliases, and the error message indicates that the function is returning the wrong list of aliases, resulting in an assertion error.

The bug occurs because the function is processing the `overridden_aliases` variable as a string while it's being compared to a set. This means it's not handling the input correctly before the split operation.

To fix the bug, the function should properly process the input parameter `aliases` and then split it based on commas to create the list of overridden aliases. Then, it should return this list.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _get_overridden_aliases(self, aliases):
    return [alias.strip() for alias in aliases.split(',')]
```

You can call this function by passing the environment variable `TF_OVERRIDDEN_ALIASES` as the input parameter.
