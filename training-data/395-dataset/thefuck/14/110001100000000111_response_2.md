Potential error location:
The potential error is in the usage of the 'self' parameter in a function that is not within a class. The use of 'self' suggests that this function is meant to be a method within a class, but it is defined outside of a class.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The use of 'self' in a function that is not within a class is causing the bug. It seems that the intention was to define this function as a method within a class, but it is currently defined outside of a class.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
Since the function does not seem to require the use of 'self' (which is used in classes to refer to the instance of the class), we can remove it from the function definition. If the intention was for this function to be a method within a class, it should be moved into a class and then the 'self' parameter would be appropriate.

Corrected code:

```python
import os

# this is the corrected function
def _get_overridden_aliases():
    overridden_aliases = os.environ.get('TF_OVERRIDDEN_ALIASES', '').strip()
    if overridden_aliases:
        return [alias.strip() for alias in overridden_aliases.split(',')]
    else:
        return ['cd', 'grep', 'ls', 'man', 'open']
```
