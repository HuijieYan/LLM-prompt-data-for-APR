The buggy function `_get_overridden_aliases` is supposed to return a list of strings after processing the input string. However, the function is currently returning a list as well as a set, which is causing the assertion error in the test.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to consistently return a list of strings.

The corrected code for the buggy function is as follows:

```python
import os

class Fish(Generic):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _get_overridden_aliases(self):
        overridden_aliases = os.environ.get('TF_OVERRIDDEN_ALIASES', '').strip()
        if overridden_aliases:
            return [alias.strip() for alias in overridden_aliases.split(',')]
        else:
            return ['cd', 'grep', 'ls', 'man', 'open']
```
