Potential Error:
The potential error in the given function is that it is trying to access the 'os' module without importing it. This will result in a NameError when trying to access 'os'.

Reason for the Bug:
The 'os' module needs to be imported in order to use its functions. Without importing 'os', the code will not have access to the os.environ function.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
The bug can be fixed by importing the 'os' module at the beginning of the Python file containing the Fish class.

Corrected Code:
```python
import os  # Import the os module at the beginning of the file

# class declaration containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def _get_overridden_aliases(self):
        overridden_aliases = os.environ.get('TF_OVERRIDDEN_ALIASES', '').strip()
        if overridden_aliases:
            return [alias.strip() for alias in overridden_aliases.split(',')]
        else:
            return ['cd', 'grep', 'ls', 'man', 'open']
```
