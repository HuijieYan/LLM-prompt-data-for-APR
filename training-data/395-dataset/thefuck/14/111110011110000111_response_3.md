The bug in the code is with the function `_get_overridden_aliases` in the `Fish` class. The function is trying to split a string of comma-separated values and return them as a list. However, the test case is failing because the expected result is a set, not a list. Additionally, it's not clear from the provided code where `os.environ` is being imported from, which could be causing issues.

To fix this issue, the function needs to return a set instead of a list, to match the expected result. Additionally, if `os.environ` is being used, it needs to be imported at the top of the file.

Here is the corrected function for the `Fish` class:

```python
import os
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def _get_overridden_aliases(self):
        overridden_aliases = os.environ.get('TF_OVERRIDDEN_ALIASES', '').strip()
        if overridden_aliases:
            return {alias.strip() for alias in overridden_aliases.split(',')}
        else:
            return {'cd', 'grep', 'ls', 'man', 'open'}
```

By making these changes, the function should return a set of overridden aliases, matching the expected result in the test cases.
