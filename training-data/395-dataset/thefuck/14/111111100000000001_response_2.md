Potential error location: The potential error in the function is the use of the 'os' module without importing it in the code.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The 'os' module is used to access environment variables, but it has not been imported in the code. This results in the 'os' module being referenced without it being available, leading to an AttributeError and the function not working as intended.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: The bug can be fixed by importing the 'os' module at the beginning of the file.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_14/thefuck/shells/fish.py

import os  # Import the os module

# class declaration containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # Corrected function
    def _get_overridden_aliases(self):
        overridden_aliases = os.environ.get('TF_OVERRIDDEN_ALIASES', '').strip()
        if overridden_aliases:
            return [alias.strip() for alias in overridden_aliases.split(',')]
        else:
            return ['cd', 'grep', 'ls', 'man', 'open']
```
