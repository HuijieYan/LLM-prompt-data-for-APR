The potential error in the provided function is in the line where the overridden_aliases variable is being set. The function is supposed to split the value of the TF_OVERRIDDEN_ALIASES environment variable by commas and then strip any leading or trailing whitespace from each alias. However, the code has a bug in this line and it appears to be setting the incorrect value for overridden_aliases.

The reason for the bug is that the original code is using the `os.environ.get` method to retrieve the value of the TF_OVERRIDDEN_ALIASES environment variable, but the method is not splitting and stripping the aliases correctly.

To fix this bug, the correct approach would be to use the `split` method directly on the retrieved environment variable value and then loop through each split item to strip any leading or trailing whitespace before returning the list of aliases.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def _get_overridden_aliases(self):
        overridden_aliases = os.environ.get('TF_OVERRIDDEN_ALIASES', '').strip()
        if overridden_aliases:
            return [alias.strip() for alias in overridden_aliases.split(',')]
        else:
            return ['cd', 'grep', 'ls', 'man', 'open']
```
