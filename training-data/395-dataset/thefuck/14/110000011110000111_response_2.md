The provided function `_get_overridden_aliases` is designed to return a list of overridden aliases from the environment variable `TF_OVERRIDDEN_ALIASES`. If the environment variable is not set or is empty, it should return a default set of aliases.

The test case for this function is set up to check whether the overridden aliases are properly extracted from the environment variable.

Error:
The error message indicates that the function is returning the overridden aliases in the wrong format. The function is currently returning a list, while the test case expects a set with specific elements.

Potential error location:
The potential error in the code is during the comparison of the returned result with the expected set in the test case.

Reason for the bug:
The bug occurs because the function is returning the overridden aliases as a list, while the test case expects the result to be a set. This mismatch causes the assertion error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the function should return the overridden aliases as a set, instead of a list.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import os

def _get_overridden_aliases(self):
    overridden_aliases = os.environ.get('TF_OVERRIDDEN_ALIASES', '').strip()
    if overridden_aliases:
        return {alias.strip() for alias in overridden_aliases.split(',')}
    else:
        return {'cd', 'grep', 'ls', 'man', 'open'}
```

With this correction, the function will return the overridden aliases as a set, matching the expected format in the test case.
