The expected behavior of the function `_get_overridden_aliases` is to return the overridden aliases if they exist, otherwise, return the default set of aliases. However, the function is not behaving as expected, as indicated by the failed test case.

The bug seems to be occurring at the point where the overridden aliases are processed. The function is not correctly splitting the overridden aliases and returning them as a list.

The reason for the bug is that the function is splitting the overridden_aliases based on commas, but it is not correctly removing the leading and trailing whitespace from each alias. This leads to an incorrect list of overridden aliases being returned.

To fix the bug, the function needs to split the overridden_aliases on commas, and then strip leading and trailing whitespace from each alias.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import os

def _get_overridden_aliases(self):
    overridden_aliases = os.environ.get('TF_OVERRIDDEN_ALIASES', '').strip()
    if overridden_aliases:
        return [alias.strip() for alias in overridden_aliases.split(',')]
    else:
        return ['cd', 'grep', 'ls', 'man', 'open']
```

With this correction, the function should split the overridden aliases correctly and return the expected list of aliases, fixing the bug.
