The buggy function `_get_overridden_aliases` takes the value of the environment variable `TF_OVERRIDDEN_ALIASES` and strips any leading or trailing whitespace. It then checks if the resulting string is empty, and if not, it splits the string using commas as the delimiter and returns the resulting list with leading and trailing whitespace removed.

The test case provides a set of strings as the expected values for the `TF_OVERRIDDEN_ALIASES` environment variable. The expected return value of the function is the set of provided strings, with leading and trailing whitespace removed.

The error message indicates that the actual return value of the function does not match the expected set of strings. It seems that the function is not correctly processing the input and generating the expected output.

The bug is likely caused by the split operation and the subsequent removal of whitespace. The function may not handle varying whitespace characters and may not correctly split the input string.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to split the input string based on commas and then apply the `strip()` function to each resulting alias. This ensures that leading and trailing whitespace is removed from each alias before being added to the output list.

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _get_overridden_aliases(self):
    overridden_aliases = os.environ.get('TF_OVERRIDDEN_ALIASES', '').strip()
    if overridden_aliases:
        return {alias.strip() for alias in overridden_aliases.split(',')}
    else:
        return {'cd', 'grep', 'ls', 'man', 'open'}
```

This code uses a set comprehension to ensure that the resulting aliases are unique. Additionally, it properly removes leading and trailing whitespace from each alias.
