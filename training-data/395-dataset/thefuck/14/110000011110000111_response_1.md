The test case is trying to verify if the `_get_overridden_aliases` method returns the expected set of aliases. The method is expected to fetch the overridden aliases from the environment variable `TF_OVERRIDDEN_ALIASES` and return them as a list of strings. If the environment variable is not set or empty, a predefined set of aliases is returned.

The error message indicates that the method is not returning the expected set of aliases. Instead, it's returning only the overridden aliases from the environment variable.

The potential error location in the code is the conditional statement `if overridden_aliases:`. It currently only checks if the environment variable is non-empty, but it should also check if it is not None. This means that if the environment variable is not set, the method should fall back to the predefined set of aliases.

To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional statement to check if the environment variable is not None and not empty. If it is, we should return the predefined set of aliases. Here's the corrected function:

```python
import os

def _get_overridden_aliases(self):
    overridden_aliases = os.environ.get('TF_OVERRIDDEN_ALIASES')
    if overridden_aliases is not None and overridden_aliases.strip():
        return [alias.strip() for alias in overridden_aliases.split(',')]
    else:
        return ['cd', 'grep', 'ls', 'man', 'open']
```
