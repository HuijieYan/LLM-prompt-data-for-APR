The bug in the function is that it's reading the value of 'TF_OVERRIDDEN_ALIASES' from the environment variable and splitting it based on commas. This is resulting in a set of aliases being returned. However, the expected behavior is to return a string of comma-separated aliases.

To fix this bug, we need to change the return statement to join the list of aliases with commas and return it as a string.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import os

def _get_overridden_aliases(self):
    overridden_aliases = os.environ.get('TF_OVERRIDDEN_ALIASES', '').strip()
    if overridden_aliases:
        return ','.join([alias.strip() for alias in overridden_aliases.split(',')])
    else:
        return 'cd,grep,ls,man,open'
```
