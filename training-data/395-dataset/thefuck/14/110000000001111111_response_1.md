The problem with the provided function is that it does not handle the case where the environment variable `TF_OVERRIDDEN_ALIASES` is set. The function is supposed to return a list of overridden aliases from the environment variable, but it currently only returns the default list if the environment variable is empty.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the function to check for the environment variable and return its value as a list of aliases if it is set.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import os

def _get_overridden_aliases(self):
    overridden_aliases = os.environ.get('TF_OVERRIDDEN_ALIASES', '').strip()
    if overridden_aliases:
        return [alias.strip() for alias in overridden_aliases.split(',')]
    else:
        return ['cd', 'grep', 'ls', 'man', 'open']
```

With this correction, the function will return the overridden aliases from the environment variable if it is set, and fall back to the default list if the environment variable is empty.
