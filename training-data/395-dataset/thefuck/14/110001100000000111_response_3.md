Potential Error location:
The error might be in the indentation and the use of 'self' in a function that doesn't seem to be a method of a class.

Reasons for the bug:
1. The use of 'self' in the function suggests that it might be intended to be a method of a class, but it is not defined as such.
2. The indentation of the function is inconsistent, which might lead to errors.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Remove the 'self' parameter from the function since it doesn't seem to be a method of a class.
2. Correct the indentation of the function to ensure it is aligned properly.

Corrected code:
```python
import os

def _get_overridden_aliases():
    overridden_aliases = os.environ.get('TF_OVERRIDDEN_ALIASES', '').strip()
    if overridden_aliases:
        return [alias.strip() for alias in overridden_aliases.split(',')]
    else:
        return ['cd', 'grep', 'ls', 'man', 'open']
```
