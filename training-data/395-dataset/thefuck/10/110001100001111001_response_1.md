Potential error location: The issue seems to be with how the script parts are being manipulated and split in the `get_new_command` function. 

Reasons behind the bug: The bug occurs because the function is incorrectly handling the replacement of '2' and '3' in the command.script. Also, the insertion of '2' and '3' in the split_cmd2 and split_cmd3 lists might not be handled correctly.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the string replace method to replace '2' and '3' in the command.script instead of manipulating the command.script_parts list directly.
2. Ensure that the split_cmd2 and split_cmd3 lists are being modified correctly by inserting '2' and '3'.
3. Use proper conditional checks to handle the different cases involving '2' and '3' in the command.script.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2")
    if '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3")

    split_cmd2 = command.script_parts[:]
    split_cmd3 = command.script_parts[:]

    split_cmd2[1] = split_cmd2[1].replace('2', ' 2 ')
    split_cmd3[1] = split_cmd3[1].replace('3', ' 3 ')

    last_arg = command.script_parts[-1]

    return [
        last_arg + ' --help',
        " ".join(split_cmd3),
        " ".join(split_cmd2),
    ]
```
