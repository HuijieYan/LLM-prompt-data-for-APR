The potential error location within the problematic function is in the condition checking for the presence of '3' and '2' in the `command.script`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not correctly handling all the given cases. In some cases, it should not just replace the characters in the command, but also manipulate the command parts based on the presence of '2' or '3' in the script.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle each case separately and correctly manipulate the command parts based on the presence of '2' or '3' in the script.

The corrected code for the problematic function is provided below:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script:
        return [command.script.replace("3", "2"), command.script.replace("3", "2"), command.script.replace("3", "2") + ' --help']
    if '2' in command.script:
        return [command.script.replace("2", "3"), command.script.replace("2", "3"), command.script.replace("2", "3") + ' --help']

    split_cmd2 = command.script_parts
    split_cmd3 = split_cmd2[:]

    split_cmd2.insert(2, '3')
    split_cmd3.insert(2, '2')

    last_arg = command.script_parts[1]

    return [
        last_arg + ' --help',
        " ".join(split_cmd3),
        " ".join(split_cmd2),
    ]
```
This corrected code should handle all the given cases and produce the expected results.
