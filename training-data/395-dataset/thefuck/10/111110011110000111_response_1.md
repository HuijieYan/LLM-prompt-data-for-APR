The error occurs when the `get_new_command` method is called with the `Command` object as an argument. The method is replacing '3' with '2' and '2' with '3' in the command, which is causing incorrect outputs.

The bug is occurring because the logic of the `get_new_command` method is not correctly handling the different inputs and conditions provided by the `Command` object. Additionally, the method is not consistent with the list of new commands specified in the test cases.

To fix the bug, the method should be updated to check for the presence of '2' and '3' in the command and apply the correct replacement or insertion based on the conditions specified in the test cases.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` method:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2"), command.script.replace("3", "2"), command.script + ' --help'
    if '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3"), command.script.replace("2", "3"), command.script + ' --help'

    last_arg = command.script_parts[-1]
    return command.script + ' --help', command.script + ' 3', command.script + ' 2'
```
