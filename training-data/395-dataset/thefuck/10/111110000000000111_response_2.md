Potential error location: The potential error in the code is in the logic of replacing '3' with '2' and '2' with '3' in the command script.

Reason behind the bug: The code first checks if '3' is present in the command script and replaces it with '2'. Then, it checks if '2' is present and replaces it with '3'. This logic is flawed because if '3' is present, it will be replaced with '2', and then the second condition will also be true, causing '2' to be replaced with '3' again, leading to incorrect results.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Instead of using multiple if conditions, the logic should be redesigned to correctly replace '3' with '2' and '2' with '3' in the command script.

Corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script:
        new_command = command.script.replace("3", "2")
    else:
        new_command = command.script.replace("2", "3")

    split_cmd2 = command.script_parts
    split_cmd3 = split_cmd2[:]

    split_cmd2.insert(1, ' 2 ')
    split_cmd3.insert(1, ' 3 ')

    last_arg = command.script_parts[-1]

    return [
        last_arg + ' --help',
        "".join(split_cmd3),
        new_command,
    ]
```
