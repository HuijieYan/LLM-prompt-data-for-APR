The buggy function has a logic error because it performs string replacements based on the appearances of '2' or '3' in the input command. It does not consider the position of these digits in the command.

The issue arises from a misinterpretation of the logic. The function incorrectly assumes that replacing '3' with '2' or vice versa would always result in a correct command. This is not always the case, as these digits could appear in different positions in the command.

To fix the bug, the function should split the command correctly, identify the position of '2' or '3', and perform the replacement accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if ' 3 ' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace(" 3 ", " 2 ")
    if ' 2 ' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace(" 2 ", " 3 ")

    if command.script_parts[1] == '2':
        command.script_parts[1] = '3'
        command.script_parts[-1] += ' --help'
        return ' '.join(command.script_parts)
    elif command.script_parts[1] == '3':
        command.script_parts[1] = '2'
        command.script_parts[-1] += ' --help'
        return ' '.join(command.script_parts)
```

This corrected code addresses the issues in the original function by properly identifying the positions of '2' and '3' in the command and performing the replacements accordingly. It also appends '--help' to the split command with the updated number.
