The function `get_new_command` is intended to modify the input command based on certain conditions and return the modified command. The function is failing for the provided test cases with the given error messages.

The bug is likely occurring due to incorrect handling of the conditions and return values within the function. Based on the error messages, it seems that the function is not returning the expected values for the given inputs.

To fix the bug, the logic within the function needs to be modified to handle the conditions appropriately and return the proper values as per the expected cases.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2"), command.script.replace("3", "2"), command.script + ' --help'
    if '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3"), command.script.replace("2", "3"), command.script + ' --help'

    if len(command.script_parts) > 1:
        split_cmd2 = command.script_parts
        split_cmd3 = split_cmd2[:]

        split_cmd2.insert(1, ' 2 ')
        split_cmd3.insert(1, ' 3 ')

        last_arg = command.script_parts[-1]

        return "".join(split_cmd3), "".join(split_cmd2), last_arg + ' --help'
    else:
        return command.script  # Handle other cases as needed
```

This corrected code should handle the conditions and return the expected values for the given test cases.
