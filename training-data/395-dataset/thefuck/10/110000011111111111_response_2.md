The function `get_new_command` has a few issues that are causing errors in the test cases.

1. In the buggy function, when '3' is in the command.script, the replacement is not performed correctly. The if conditions are independent of each other, so both can be true for the same input, resulting in the wrong replacement. Also, in both cases, it should return the replaced value immediately without performing any further operations.

2. In the buggy function, `split_cmd2` and `split_cmd3` are derived from `command.script_parts` and then modified independently. However, these modifications should be performed on the same list (`command.script_parts`), but it should not be done in-place. A statement like `split_cmd2 = command.script_parts[:]` should be used to create a copy.

3. The bug is causing the incorrect output, which is leading to test failures.

Approach for fixing the bug:
1. Use a single `if-else` condition to ensure that only one replacement is performed based on the condition.
2. Use slicing to create a new list for `split_cmd2` and `split_cmd3`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2")
    elif '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3")
    else:
        split_cmd2 = command.script_parts[:]
        split_cmd3 = command.script_parts[:]
        split_cmd2.insert(1, ' 2 ')
        split_cmd3.insert(1, ' 3 ')
        last_arg = command.script_parts[-1]
        return [
            last_arg + ' --help',
            "".join(split_cmd3),
            "".join(split_cmd2),
        ]
```
