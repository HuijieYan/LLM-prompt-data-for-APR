The test function is expecting the result of `get_new_command` to be a list, but the function is returning either a string or a list that contains a string and two other strings. This mismatch in return types is causing the assertion errors in the test function.

The potential error is in the `get_new_command` function, where different types of return values are being generated.

The bug is caused by the fact that the `get_new_command` function returns different data types - sometimes a string, sometimes a list of strings. This inconsistency in return types leads to an assertion error in the test function.

To fix the bug, the `get_new_command` function should consistently return a list containing strings, as this is the expected return type in the test function. Additionally, it needs to handle all the return cases properly.

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script:
        return [command.script.replace("3", "2")]
    if '2' in command.script:
        return [command.script.replace("2", "3")]
    
    split_cmd2 = command.script_parts
    split_cmd3 = split_cmd2[:]

    split_cmd2.insert(1, ' 2 ')
    split_cmd3.insert(1, ' 3 ')

    last_arg = command.script_parts[-1]

    return [
        last_arg + ' --help',
        "".join(split_cmd3),
        "".join(split_cmd2),
    ]
```

By consistently returning a list of strings, we have fixed the return type inconsistency in the original `get_new_command` function. This should resolve the assertion errors in the test function.
