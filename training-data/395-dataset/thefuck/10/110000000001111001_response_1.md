Potential Error Location: The if conditions only check for the presence of '3' or '2' in the `command.script` but do not handle the case where both '3' and '2' are present. This results in incorrect replacements when both '3' and '2' are present in the input string.

Reason for Bug: The if conditions are written as separate conditions, so when both '3' and '2' are present, only the first condition that evaluates to true is executed, leading to incorrect output.

Approach for Fixing the Bug: Combine the if conditions into a single if-else block to handle cases where both '3' and '2' are present. Additionally, maintain the order of replacement when both conditions are true.

Corrected Code:
```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script and '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2")
    else:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3")
```

Note: The assumption is made that the replacement should take place in a specific order, i.e., first replacing '3' with '2' then replacing '2' with '3' if both are present. If a different replacement logic is required, the code will need to be adjusted accordingly.
