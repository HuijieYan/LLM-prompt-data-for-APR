The test cases are comparing the output of the `get_new_command` function with the expected output. The error message indicates that the expected output is different from the actual output of the function.

Upon analyzing the code, it seems that the issue lies in the `get_new_command` function. The function does not handle the cases where both '2' and '3' are present in the command.script, which causes the unexpected output.

The buggy function does not account for the situation where both '2' and '3' are present in the command.script. It only replaces '3' with '2' and vice versa if one of them is present. However, in cases where both are present, the function incorrectly inserts '2' and '3' at the same position in split_cmd2 and split_cmd3.

A possible approach for fixing the bug in the function could be to first check if both '2' and '3' are present in the command.script and then create modified versions of the split_cmd2 and split_cmd3. After that, the function should return the correct combination of modified commands based on the presence of '2' and '3' in the command.script.

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script and '2' in command.script:
        modified_cmd2 = command.script.replace("2", "3")
        modified_cmd3 = command.script.replace("3", "2")
        return [
            command.script[:-len(command.script.split()[-1])] + modified_cmd3 + " --help",
            command.script[:-len(command.script.split()[-1])] + command.script.replace("3", "2") + " --help",
            command.script[:-len(command.script.split()[-1])] + modified_cmd2 + " --help"
        ]
    elif '3' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2")
    elif '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3")
    else:
        split_cmd2 = command.script.split()
        split_cmd3 = split_cmd2[:]
        split_cmd2.insert(1, ' 2 ')
        split_cmd3.insert(1, ' 3 ')
        last_arg = command.script.split()[-1]
        return [
            last_arg + ' --help',
            " ".join(split_cmd3),
            " ".join(split_cmd2),
        ]
```
