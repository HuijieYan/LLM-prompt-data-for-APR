The error message from the test function indicates that the function `get_new_command` is not producing the expected output. The test cases involve providing `Command` objects with specific `script` and `stderr` attributes and comparing the output of `get_new_command` against the expected new command. In both cases, the actual output does not match the expected output.

The potential error location within the `get_new_command` function is the conditional logic used for replacing '2' with '3' and vice versa. The logic for handling '2' and '3' in the script is incorrect, leading to unexpected outputs.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the conditional replacements are not being handled correctly. When '3' is present, it should be replaced with '2' and vice versa. However, the current implementation replaces one character with another without considering other conditions.

To fix the bug, we need to revise the conditional logic for replacing '2' and '3' in the script. The corrected version of the function is provided below:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2")
    if '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3")

    split_cmd2 = command.script.split()
    split_cmd3 = split_cmd2[:]

    split_cmd2[1] = '3'
    split_cmd3[1] = '2'

    last_arg = split_cmd2[-1]

    return [
        last_arg + ' --help',
        " ".join(split_cmd3),
        " ".join(split_cmd2),
    ]
```

In this corrected version, the conditional replacements for '2' and '3' are handled separately, and the split command elements are manipulated along with the correct conditional logic. This should address the issues witnessed in the test cases and produce the expected output.
