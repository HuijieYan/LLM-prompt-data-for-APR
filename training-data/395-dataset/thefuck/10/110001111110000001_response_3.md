The test case is checking if the output of the `get_new_command` function matches the expected output for different commands. The error message indicates that there is a mismatch between the expected output and the actual output for the commands 'man read' and 'man missing'.

Upon analyzing the buggy function, we can see that there are two conditional statements checking for the presence of '3' or '2' in the command script. If neither '3' nor '2' is present in the script, it constructs a new command by inserting '2' and '3' into the script parts. However, the logic for constructing the new command seems incorrect.

The buggy logic in the function is that it constructs the new command by adding '2' and '3' into the `split_cmd2` and `split_cmd3` lists, but does not fully use these lists to construct the new command.

To fix this bug, we should construct the new command using the `split_cmd2` and `split_cmd3` lists which have '2' and '3' inserted at the appropriate positions.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2")
    if '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3")

    split_cmd2 = command.script_parts[:]
    split_cmd3 = command.script_parts[:]

    split_cmd2.insert(1, ' 2 ')
    split_cmd3.insert(1, ' 3 ')

    last_arg = command.script_parts[-1]

    return [
        last_arg + ' --help',
        "".join(split_cmd3),
        "".join(split_cmd2),
    ]
```

This corrected code constructs the new command using the `split_cmd2` and `split_cmd3` lists, which allows for the correct transformation of the original command script.
