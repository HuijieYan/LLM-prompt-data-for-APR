Potential error location: 
The issue is likely due to the incorrect use of the `command` object and its properties.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The function is using `command.script` and `command.script_parts` without properly checking and handling their existence.
2. The function is trying to access `command.script` and `command.script_parts` properties as if they are strings and lists, but in reality they might not be.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the type of `command.script` and `command.script_parts` before using them.
2. Use proper methods or properties to access the command and its parts.

Corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2")
    if '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3")

    # Use proper way to access the command parts
    split_cmd2 = command.script.split()
    split_cmd3 = split_cmd2[:]

    split_cmd2.insert(1, '2')
    split_cmd3.insert(1, '3')

    last_arg = split_cmd2[-1]

    return [
        last_arg + ' --help',
        " ".join(split_cmd3),
        " ".join(split_cmd2),
    ]
```
