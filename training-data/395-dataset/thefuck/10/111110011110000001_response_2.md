The error occurs because the function get_new_command does not properly handle the cases where there is both '2' and '3' in the command.script. It replaces '3' with '2' and '2' with '3' without considering the context in which they appear.

The potential error location is within the if statements checking for '2' and '3' in the command.script and the subsequent replacements.

The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle the context in which '2' and '3' appear in the script. It simply replaces '2' with '3' and '3' with '2' without considering the context or position.

To fix the bug, we need to separate the cases for '2' and '3' and handle them separately based on their respective contexts. We also need to correctly handle the cases where both '2' and '3' are present in the script.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script:
        split_cmd = command.script.split('3')
        return '3'.join(split_cmd[:-1]) + '2' + split_cmd[-1]
    if '2' in command.script:
        split_cmd = command.script.split('2')
        return '2'.join(split_cmd[:-1]) + '3' + split_cmd[-1]

    split_cmd2 = command.script_parts
    split_cmd3 = split_cmd2[:]

    split_cmd2.insert(1, ' 2 ')
    split_cmd3.insert(1, ' 3 ')

    last_arg = command.script_parts[-1]

    return [
        last_arg + ' --help',
        "".join(split_cmd3),
        "".join(split_cmd2),
    ]
```

With this correction, the function should now properly handle the cases where '2' and '3' appear in the script and handle their replacements accordingly.
