The `get_new_command` function has several issues that lead to failures in the provided test cases.

Issues:
1. The conditions checking for the presence of '3' and '2' in the command script are incorrect. They should be checking `command.script` instead of `command.script` and should be in `if-elif` blocks to prevent multiple replacements in the same script.
2. The logic to create `split_cmd2` and `split_cmd3` is incorrect. It should create copies of `command.script_parts` and then modify the copies.
3. The `last_arg` variable should be assigned after modifying `split_cmd2` and `split_cmd3`.

Proposed Fix:
```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2"),  # Return as a list to match the test cases
    elif '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3"),  # Return as a list to match the test cases

    split_cmd2 = command.script_parts[:]
    split_cmd3 = command.script_parts[:]

    split_cmd2.insert(1, ' 2 ')
    split_cmd3.insert(1, ' 3 ')

    last_arg = command.script_parts[-1]

    return [
        last_arg + ' --help',
        "".join(split_cmd3),
        "".join(split_cmd2),
    ]
```

Explanation:
The buggy function incorrectly handles the script and its parts. It tries to replace characters within the script and parts without creating copies. This leads to incorrect comparisons and modifications. Additionally, the return value doesn't match the expected format.

The proposed fix corrects the logical errors and returns the results in the expected format. It properly handles the modifications to the script and script parts and ensures that `last_arg` is assigned after the modifications.

The correct implementation should resolve the issues and make the function return the expected results for the provided test cases.
