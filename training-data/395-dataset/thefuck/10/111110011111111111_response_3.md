The error occurs in the `get_new_command` function. The function is supposed to modify the input command object based on certain conditions, but it seems to be handling the conditions incorrectly, leading to incorrect outputs.

The bug occurs because the function checks for the presence of '3' before checking for the presence of '2'. This results in '3' being replaced with '2' and then '2' being replaced with '3' in the same command, which is incorrect.

To fix the function, the conditions should be properly nested to ensure they are mutually exclusive.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2").replace("--help", "")
    elif '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3").replace("--help --help", "--help")
    else:
        last_arg = command.script_parts[-1]
        return [
            last_arg + ' --help',
            " ".join(command.script_parts[:1] + ['3'] + command.script_parts[2:]),
            " ".join(command.script_parts[:1] + ['2'] + command.script_parts[2:]),
        ]
```

This corrected function should handle the given test cases correctly and produce the expected outputs.
