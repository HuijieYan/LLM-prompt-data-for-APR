The buggy function `get_new_command` has a few issues that are causing the errors in the test case.

1. The code does not handle the case for direct substitution where the command consists of only numbers, like 'man 3 read' or 'man 2 read'. It should replace '3' with '2' and vice versa for these cases.

2. The return statement of the function is flawed. It should return a list of strings, but it's returning a list with a mix of strings and a list. This is causing the assertion errors in the test cases.

3. The logic for splitting the command into '2' and '3' variants is incorrect. It should handle the case where the command has options and arguments, such as 'man -s2 read'. It currently doesn't handle these cases properly.

To fix the code, we can modify the logic to properly replace '3' with '2' and vice versa. Additionally, the return statement should be revised to return a list of strings as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if command.script.endswith('3'):
        return command.script[:-1] + '2'
    if command.script.endswith('2'):
        return command.script[:-1] + '3'

    split_cmd = command.script.split()
    split_cmd_2 = [p.replace('3', '2') for p in split_cmd]
    split_cmd_3 = [p.replace('2', '3') for p in split_cmd]

    return [
        ' '.join(split_cmd_3) + ' --help',
        ' '.join(split_cmd_2) + ' --help'
    ]
```

With these corrections, the `get_new_command` function should now handle the given test cases without any assertion errors.
