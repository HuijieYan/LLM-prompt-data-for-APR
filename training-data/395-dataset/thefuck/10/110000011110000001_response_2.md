The test case is checking if the `get_new_command` function returns the expected new command based on the input command. The error message indicates that the function is not returning the expected value for the test cases.

The potential error in the function is that it does not handle the cases where '3' or '2' are not present in the command script.

The bug occurs because the function directly tries to replace '3' with '2' and vice versa without checking if they exist in the command script. It also does not handle cases where '3' or '2' are not present in the command script.

To fix the bug, we can add checks to see if '3' or '2' is present in the script, and if not, return a new command with '--help' appended to the last argument.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2")
    if '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3")

    split_cmd2 = command.script_parts[:]
    split_cmd3 = command.script_parts[:]

    split_cmd2.insert(1, ' 2 ')
    split_cmd3.insert(1, ' 3 ')

    return [
        command.script_parts[-1] + ' --help',
        "".join(split_cmd3),
        "".join(split_cmd2),
    ]
```

With these changes, the function now handles the cases where '3' or '2' are not present in the command script and returns the expected new command based on the input command.
