The buggy function `get_new_command` appears to be intended to modify the input command based on the presence of '2' or '3' within the script. However, there are a few issues with the implementation:

1. The conditions for replacing '3' with '2' and vice versa are not mutually exclusive, so both replacements might occur for the same input, leading to unexpected behavior.
2. The code doesn't handle the case where neither '2' nor '3' is present in the script.
3. The logic for splitting and modifying `split_cmd2` and `split_cmd3` is incorrect.

To fix the buggy function, the following corrections can be made:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script and '2' not in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2"), command.script.replace("3", "2") + ' --help'
    if '2' in command.script and '3' not in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3"), command.script.replace("2", "3") + ' --help'
    if '2' in command.script and '3' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3"), command.script.replace("2", "3") + ' --help'

    return [command.script + ' --help']
```

These changes should address the issues in the original function and ensure that the input commands are modified correctly based on the presence of '2' or '3', and also handle cases where neither '2' nor '3' is present in the input script.
