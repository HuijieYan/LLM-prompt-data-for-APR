The issue with the provided code is that it returns a list of commands in the 'get_new_command' function, which does not match the expected return type of a single command string.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not handling the command.script input properly and returning a list of commands instead of a single command string.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function returns a single command string instead of a list of commands.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2")
    if '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3")

    if ' -s2 ' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3")
    if ' -s3 ' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2")

    return command.script.replace("2", "3").replace("3", "2")
```

This corrected code will handle the input command.script and return a single, corrected command string.
