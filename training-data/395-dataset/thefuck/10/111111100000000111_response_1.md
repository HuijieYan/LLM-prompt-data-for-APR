Potential error location: The error could be in how the function is trying to replace '3' with '2' and '2' with '3' in the command.script.

Reasons behind the bug: The function is checking for the presence of '3' and '2' separately in the command, and if found, it replaces them directly. This can lead to incorrect replacements if both '3' and '2' are present in the command.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use a single replace statement to replace '3' with a temporary placeholder, then replace '2' with '3', and finally replace the placeholder with '2'.
2. Use a list to keep track of the command parts and modify it accordingly based on the presence of '2' or '3'

Corrected code:
```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "temp").replace("2", "3").replace("temp", "2")
    if '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("2", "temp").replace("3", "2").replace("temp", "3")

    split_cmd = command.script_parts
    split_cmd.append('--help')
    split_cmd[1:1] = [' 2 ']
    split_cmd_copy = split_cmd[:]
    split_cmd_copy[1:1] = [' 3 ']

    return [" ".join(split_cmd), " ".join(split_cmd_copy)]
```
