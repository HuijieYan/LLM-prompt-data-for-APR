Potential error location:
The potential error is in the lines where split_cmd2 and split_cmd3 are modified. The index 1 is used to insert '2' and '3' into the split_cmd2 and split_cmd3 lists, but these lists are not being used to build the new command.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the split_cmd2 and split_cmd3 lists are being modified and then concatenated, but the result is not being used as part of the new command.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use split_cmd2 and split_cmd3 to build the new command.
2. Use a conditional check to determine which replacement to make based on the original command.

Corrected code:
```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2")
    if '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3")

    split_cmd = command.script_parts
    new_cmds = []

    for index, part in enumerate(split_cmd):
        if part.strip() != '':
            split_cmd2 = split_cmd[:]
            split_cmd3 = split_cmd[:]
            split_cmd2.insert(index, ' 2 ')
            split_cmd3.insert(index, ' 3 ')

            last_arg = split_cmd[-1]

            new_cmds.append([
                last_arg + ' --help',
                "".join(split_cmd3).strip(),
                "".join(split_cmd2).strip(),
            ])

    return new_cmds
```
