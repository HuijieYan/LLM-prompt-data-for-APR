The given code has two issues. The first issue is that the if conditions are allowing the second if statement to execute even if the first one has executed. The second issue is that the logic inside both if statements is incorrect and not handling the commands appropriately.

The first issue can be fixed by using `elif` for the second condition so that it only executes if the first condition is false.

The second issue can be fixed by splitting the command and then modifying the parts as required.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2")
    elif '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3")
    else:
        split_cmd = command.script_parts
        last_arg = split_cmd[-1]

        split_cmd2 = split_cmd[:]
        split_cmd3 = split_cmd[:]

        split_cmd2.insert(1, ' 2 ')
        split_cmd3.insert(1, ' 3 ')

        return [
            last_arg + ' --help',
            " ".join(split_cmd3),
            " ".join(split_cmd2),
        ]
```
