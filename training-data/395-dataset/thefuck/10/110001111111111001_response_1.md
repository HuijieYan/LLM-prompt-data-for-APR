The buggy function `get_new_command` is meant to take a command and return a new command based on the input. However, the function is not working as intended and is causing errors in the test cases.

The function has issues with handling certain cases, specifically when '2' or '3' are present in the input command's script. It appears that the function is not behaving as expected and is not returning the correct values based on the input.

This is likely due to the incorrect logic used in the function. The conditional statements and variable assignments are not handling all the cases properly. In particular, the logic for replacing '2' with '3' and vice versa needs to be revised.

To fix the bug, the logic for replacing '2' with '3' and vice versa should be updated, and additional conditions should be added to handle the input command correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2")
    if '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3")

    split_cmd2 = command.script_parts[:]
    split_cmd3 = command.script_parts[:]

    split_cmd2.insert(1, ' 2 ')
    split_cmd3.insert(1, ' 3 ')

    last_arg = command.script_parts[-1]

    return [
        last_arg + ' --help',
        " ".join(split_cmd3),
        " ".join(split_cmd2),
    ]
```

This correction addresses issues with handling cases where '2' and '3' appear in the input script and ensures that the function returns the correct values for each case.
