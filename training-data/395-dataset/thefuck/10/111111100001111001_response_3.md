Potential error location: The issue may lie in the way the split_cmd2 and split_cmd3 lists are being manipulated before being combined and returned.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The function is supposed to modify the command script to use '2' instead of '3' and vice versa, but the manipulation of the split_cmd2 and split_cmd3 lists is incorrect in some cases, leading to incorrect command replacement.

Approach for fixing the bug:
1. Use the correct index for inserting '2' or '3' into the split_cmd2 and split_cmd3 lists.
2. Ensure that the modified lists are combined correctly and make use of the original command script to avoid unnecessary replacements.
3. Consider using if-else statements for a more structured approach.

Corrected code:
```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2")
    if '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3")

    split_cmd2 = command.script_parts[:]
    split_cmd3 = command.script_parts[:]

    split_cmd2.insert(1, '2')
    split_cmd3.insert(1, '3')

    last_arg = command.script_parts[-1]

    return [
        last_arg + ' --help',
        " ".join(split_cmd3),
        " ".join(split_cmd2),
    ]
```
