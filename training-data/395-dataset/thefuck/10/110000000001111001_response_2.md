The buggy function `get_new_command` is trying to modify the command input based on certain conditions. However, the use of `command.script` and `command.script_parts` is inconsistent, which leads to incorrect results.

In the buggy code, the function uses `command.script` when checking for '3' or '2', but `command.script_parts` elsewhere. This inconsistency can lead to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the function should consistently use `command.script_parts` instead of `command.script` for checking and modifying the command.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script_parts:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2")
    if '2' in command.script_parts:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3")

    split_cmd2 = command.script_parts
    split_cmd3 = split_cmd2[:]

    split_cmd2.insert(1, ' 2 ')
    split_cmd3.insert(1, ' 3 ')

    last_arg = command.script_parts[-1]

    return [
        last_arg + ' --help',
        " ".join(split_cmd3),
        " ".join(split_cmd2),
    ]
```

With this correction, the function now uses `command.script_parts` consistently, ensuring that the modifications are applied to the command input correctly.
