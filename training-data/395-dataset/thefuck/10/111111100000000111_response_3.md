Potential Error Location: The issue seems to be with the use of "command.script" and "command.script_parts". 

Reasons for the Bug: 
1. The function is trying to replace the characters '3' and '2' in the command, but it's using "command.script" instead of "command.script_parts" for this purpose.
2. The function is also trying to modify the command by inserting '2' and '3' at index 1, but the insertion operation is done on "split_cmd2" and "split_cmd3" which are copies of "command.script_parts", but it's not updating the original "command.script_parts".

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. We should use "command.script_parts" for replacing the characters '3' and '2' in the command.
2. We should directly modify the "command.script_parts" by inserting '2' and '3' at index 1.

Corrected Code:
```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2")
    if '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3")

    split_cmd2 = command.script_parts[:]
    split_cmd3 = command.script_parts[:]

    split_cmd2.insert(1, ' 2 ')
    split_cmd3.insert(1, ' 3 ')

    last_arg = split_cmd2[-1]

    return [
        last_arg + ' --help',
        "".join(split_cmd3),
        "".join(split_cmd2),
    ]
```
