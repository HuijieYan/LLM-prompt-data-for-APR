The buggy function `get_new_command` seems to be taking a `command` object as input and is expected to return a new command based on the original command. However, the implementation of the function has some issues. It tries to modify the command directly by replacing '2' with '3' and vice versa, and also tries to manipulate the command by inserting new elements into a split command.

The test case parameters and error messages indicate that the function is not behaving as expected. The new command is not being generated correctly based on the original command.

The potential error location within the function is the logic for modifying the command, especially using the `split_cmd2` and `split_cmd3` lists.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug may include:
1. Incorrect handling of the command object's attributes.
2. Approaches for fixing the bug:
3. Use the `command.script` attribute directly to modify the command.
4. Avoid splitting and joining the command individually and instead directly modify the command string.

The corrected code for the problematic function `get_new_command` would be:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2")
    if '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3")
    
    # Use the command.script attribute for modification
    new_command = f"{command.script} --help"
    
    return [f'man 3 {command.script}', f'man 2 {command.script}', new_command]
```

This corrected code directly modifies the `command.script` attribute to generate the new command, and constructs the final list of new commands based on the modified `command.script`.
