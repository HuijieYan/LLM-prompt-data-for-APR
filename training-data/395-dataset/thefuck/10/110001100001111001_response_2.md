The buggy function takes a command as input and processes it. However, the function contains incorrect logic and returns unexpected results. 

The issue arises from the if-elif block where it checks if '3' or '2' is in the command.script. The logic in the if-elif block is faulty as it doesn't cover all the cases and the subsequent split_cmd2 and split_cmd3 manipulations are incorrect.

To fix the function, the logic for replacing '3' with '2' and '2' with '3' can be moved to their respective if conditions. If neither '3' nor '2' is present, there is no need for further manipulation. 

After analyzing the test cases, here's the corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2")
    elif '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3")
    else:
        return command.script
```
This code addresses both the incorrect logic and the lack of coverage for certain cases, providing a more accurate output for the given test cases.
