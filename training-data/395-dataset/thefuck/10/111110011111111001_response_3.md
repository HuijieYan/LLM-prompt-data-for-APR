The issue seems to be related to how the program handles the command input and then replaces certain parts of it. The bug occurs because the function is not correctly replacing the '2' and '3' in the command and is also returning the results in a different order than expected.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `get_new_command` function to correctly replace '2' with '3' and '3' with '2', as well as ensure that the order of the returned commands matches the expected output.

Here is the corrected `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2")
    if '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3")

    split_cmd2 = command.script_parts[:]
    split_cmd3 = command.script_parts[:]

    split_cmd2[1] = '2'
    split_cmd3[1] = '3'

    last_arg = command.script_parts[-1]

    return [
        last_arg + ' --help',
        " ".join(split_cmd3),
        " ".join(split_cmd2),
    ]
```

With this modification, the function should now correctly handle the input commands and produce the expected outputs. This should also resolve the errors reported in the test cases.
