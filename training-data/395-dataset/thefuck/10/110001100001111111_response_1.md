Potential error location: The issue lies in the conditional statements that replace '3' with '2' and vice versa. 

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The buggy function does not handle the case when both '3' and '2' are present in the command. It also does not consider the cases when the command includes additional arguments.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use a single if-else statement to check for the presence of '3' and '2' in the command.
2. If both '3' and '2' are present, replace '3' with '2' and vice versa while considering additional arguments in the command.
3. Handle the case where additional arguments are present by splitting the command and modifying individual parts accordingly.

Corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    new_command = command.script.replace("3", "x").replace("2", "3").replace("x", "2")
    new_command_parts = command.script_parts[:]
    new_command_parts[new_command_parts.index("2")] = "3"
    new_command_parts[new_command_parts.index("x")] = "2"
    
    last_arg = new_command_parts[-1]
    
    return [
        last_arg + ' --help',
        " ".join(new_command_parts),
        new_command
    ]
```
