The bug in the function is due to the incorrect implementation of the condition checks and the return statements. The function needs to handle different cases based on the presence of '2' or '3' in the command script.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The first 'if' condition checks for '3' in the command.script while the second 'if' condition checks for '2', which is redundant and may cause unexpected behavior.
2. Different return statements are used for replacing '3' with '2' and vice versa, which may lead to incorrect results.
3. The split_cmd2 and split_cmd3 lists are incorrectly used, causing issues with the correct combination of commands.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use a single 'if-else' condition to handle the cases of '2' or '3' in the command script.
2. Combine the split_cmd2 and split_cmd3 lists to form the correct new commands based on the presence of '2' or '3'.
3. Modify the return statement to provide the correct output based on the condition checks.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script:
        return [command.script.replace("3", "2"), command.script.replace("3", "2"), command.script + ' --help']
    elif '2' in command.script:
        return [command.script.replace("2", "3"), command.script.replace("2", "3"), command.script + ' --help']
    
    split_cmd = command.script.split()
    new_commands = []
    for i, part in enumerate(split_cmd):
        if part.isdigit():
            temp_cmd = split_cmd[:]
            temp_cmd[i] = str(3 if part == '2' else 2)
            new_commands.append(' '.join(temp_cmd))
    new_commands.append(command.script + ' --help')
    return new_commands
```

The corrected code handles the condition checks for '2' and '3' in the command script and constructs the new commands accordingly. It also forms the split_cmd list and generates the new commands based on the presence of '2' or '3'. Finally, it returns the correct output based on the condition checks.
