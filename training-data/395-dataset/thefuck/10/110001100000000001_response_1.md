Potential error location: The code has an issue with replacing '2' and '3' in the command script. Additionally, there is an issue with the insertion of '2' and '3' in the split_cmd2 and split_cmd3 lists.

Reasons behind the bug: The first if statement replaces all occurrences of '3' with '2', and the second if statement replaces all occurrences of '2' with '3', which may not be the intended behavior. Additionally, the insertion of '2' and '3' in the lists split_cmd2 and split_cmd3 may not produce the desired new command.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use a different approach to replace '2' and '3' in the command script.
2. Replace the elements in split_cmd2 and split_cmd3 lists in a manner that produces the correct result.

Corrected code:
```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2")
    elif '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3")
    else:
        split_cmd2 = command.script_parts[:]
        split_cmd3 = command.script_parts[:]
        split_cmd2.insert(1, ' 2 ')
        split_cmd3.insert(1, ' 3 ')

        last_arg = command.script_parts[-1]

        return [
            last_arg + ' --help',
            "".join(split_cmd3),
            "".join(split_cmd2),
        ]
```
