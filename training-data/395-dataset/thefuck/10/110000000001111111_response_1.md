The function aims to modify the command string by replacing occurrences of "3" with "2" and vice versa. Additionally, it constructs a modified version of the command string by inserting "2" or "3" at specific positions.

The bug occurs in the function due to the incorrect replacement logic and misinterpretation of the input command.

In the buggy function, the logic for replacing "3" with "2" and "2" with "3" is flawed. It only performs the replacement for the first occurrence of "3" or "2" in the command, and this is not the intended behavior.

To fix the bug:
1. Use the `replace` function to replace all occurrences of "3" with "2" and vice versa, in the command string.
2. Modify the construction of split_cmd3 and split_cmd2 to ensure that "3" and "2" are inserted at the correct positions in the command string.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    modified_cmd = command.script.replace("3", "x").replace("2", "3").replace("x", "2")  # replace all 3 with a temporary value then replace all 2 with 3 and all temporary values with 2
    modified_cmd2 = command.script.replace("3", "x").replace("2", "3").replace("x", "2")
    modified_cmd3 = command.script.replace("3", "2")

    return [
        command.script_parts[-1] + ' --help',
        modified_cmd3,
        modified_cmd2,
    ]
```
