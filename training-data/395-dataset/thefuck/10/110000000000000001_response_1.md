Potential error location: 
The function is trying to replace '3' with '2' and vice versa, but the code is not structured correctly. Also, there is no logic for when neither '2' nor '3' are in the command.

Reasons for the bug: 
The function does not handle the case when neither '2' nor '3' are in the command. Additionally, the logic for replacing '3' with '2' and vice versa is incorrect.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Check if the command contains '2' and '3' and replace them accordingly.
2. Add a conditional statement to handle the case when neither '2' nor '3' are in the command.
3. Restructure the logic for replacing '2' with '3' and vice versa.

Corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script and '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2").replace("2", "3")
    elif '3' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2")
    elif '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3")
    else:
        return command.script + ' --help'
```
