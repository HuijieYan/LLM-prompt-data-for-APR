Potential error location: The issue is with the if statements at the beginning of the function. It doesn't handle the case where both '3' and '2' are in the command, and it also replaces all instances of '3' or '2' in the command, not just the first one.

Reason for the bug: The if statements only check for '3' or '2' and replace them without considering the presence of both numbers in the command.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check for both '3' and '2' in the command and replace them separately.
2. Use the split command to insert '2' and '3' after the first element, regardless of their presence in the original command.
3. Handle the case where both '3' and '2' are in the command by replacing them separately.

Corrected code:
```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script and '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace('3', '2').replace('2', '3', 1)
    
    if '3' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace('3', '2')
    elif '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace('2', '3')

    split_cmd = command.script_parts
    split_cmd.insert(1, ' 2 ')
    split_cmd.insert(1, ' 3 ')

    last_arg = command.script_parts[-1]

    return [
        last_arg + ' --help',
        "".join(split_cmd),
    ]
```
