Potential error location: The problem seems to be with the conditional checks. The function checks for the presence of '3' or '2' in the command.script to replace them with '2' or '3' respectively. However, the issue arises when the conditional checks are reversed. Also, the handling of '2' and '3' replacements is incorrect for different command.script inputs.

Reason behind the bug: The conditional checks are reversed, and the handling of '2' and '3' replacements is incorrect, which causes unexpected behavior.

Approach for fixing the bug: 
1. Swap the conditional checks for '2' and '3' so that '3' is checked first and then '2'.
2. Replace the '2' and '3' in the command.script with empty spaces and then insert '2' or '3' at the correct position based on the input. This will handle different cases of command.script inputs appropriately.

Corrected code:
```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2")
    elif '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3")
    else:
        split_cmd2 = command.script_parts[:]
        split_cmd3 = command.script_parts[:]

        split_cmd2.insert(1, '2')
        split_cmd3.insert(1, '3')

        last_arg = command.script_parts[-1]

        return [
            last_arg + ' --help',
            " ".join(split_cmd3),
            " ".join(split_cmd2),
        ]
```
