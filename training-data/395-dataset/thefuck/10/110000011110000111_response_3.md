The error message indicates that the expected output does not match the actual output for the test cases. It mentions a mismatch for the 'read --help' and 'man 3 read' values in the list. 

The potential error location within the function is in the `if` statements at the beginning of the `get_new_command` function. The function first checks for the presence of '3' and '2' in the command script but does not handle the replacement accordingly.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug are:
1. The `if` statements in the function do not handle the replacement of '3' and '2' appropriately.
2. The function lacks a default response in case none of the conditions are met.

To fix the bug, the `if` statements need to be modified to correctly handle the replacement of '3' and '2' in the command script. Additionally, a default response could be added to cover cases where neither '3' nor '2' exists in the command script.

The corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2")
    elif '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3")
    else:
        split_cmd2 = command.script_parts
        split_cmd3 = split_cmd2[:]

        split_cmd2.insert(1, ' 2 ')
        split_cmd3.insert(1, ' 3 ')

        last_arg = command.script_parts[-1]

        return [
            last_arg + ' --help',
            "".join(split_cmd3),
            "".join(split_cmd2),
        ]
``` 

With these modifications, the function should handle the script replacements correctly and provide the expected output for the test cases.
