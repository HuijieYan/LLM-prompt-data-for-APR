Potential error location: The if-else conditions are not mutually exclusive, so it will change both "3" to "2" and "2" to "3" in the input command.

Reason for the bug: The function is not correctly replacing the numbers "2" and "3" in the given command and is also manipulating the command improperly.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use mutually exclusive if-else conditions to ensure that only one replacement is done at a time.
2. Properly split the command and modify the specific part that contains "2" or "3" without affecting the rest of the command.

Corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if '3' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("3", "2")
    elif '2' in command.script:
        return command.script.replace("2", "3")
    else:
        split_cmd = command.script.split()
        for i, part in enumerate(split_cmd):
            if '3' in part:
                split_cmd[i] = part.replace("3", "2")
            elif '2' in part:
                split_cmd[i] = part.replace("2", "3")
        return ' '.join(split_cmd)
```
