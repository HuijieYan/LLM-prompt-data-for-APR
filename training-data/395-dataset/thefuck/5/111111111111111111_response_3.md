The test case calls the `match` function with a Command object representing a git push command, and its associated output. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert not match(Command('git push origin', output_bitbucket))` failed because the `match` function returned True when it should have returned False.

The potential error location is in the `match` function, specifically in the line `and 'set-upstream' in command.output`. This condition checks if 'set-upstream' is present in the output of the command, but it should instead check if 'set-upstream' is present in the output of the command and the script contains 'push'.

The bug occurs because the current implementation only checks if 'set-upstream' is present in the output, without considering whether the command actually contains 'push'.

To fix the bug, the condition `and 'set-upstream' in command.output` should be modified to `and 'set-upstream' in command.output and 'push' in command.script_parts`.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('push' in command.script_parts
            and 'set-upstream' in command.output)
```
