The error occurs when the function `match` is called with the command `Command('git push origin', output_bitbucket)`. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert not match(...)` is failing, suggesting that the `match` function is returning `True` when it should be returning `False`. 

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `return` statement. The `match` function is checking if 'push' is in `command.script_parts` and 'set-upstream' is in `command.output`. The bug occurs because 'set-upstream' is being incorrectly matched in the command output, leading to an incorrect `True` return value for the test case.

The bug occurs because the `match` function is incorrectly checking for 'set-upstream' in `command.output` as a standalone phrase, while in reality, 'set-upstream' is a part of a larger string in the output. This leads to the incorrect `True` return value for the test case.

The bug can be fixed by modifying the `match` function to check for 'set-upstream' as a substring in `command.output`. Additionally, the condition for 'push' should check if 'push' is the first element in `command.script_parts`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('push' == command.script_parts[0]
            and 'set-upstream' in command.output)
```

With this correction, the `match` function now correctly checks if 'push' is the first element in the `command.script_parts` and if 'set-upstream' is present in `command.output`.
