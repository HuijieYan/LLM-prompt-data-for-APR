Potential error location: 

The potential error is in the `match` function where the condition for checking if 'push' is in the command parts and 'set-upstream' is in the command output might not be sufficient for the intended functionality.

Reasons behind the bug: 

The condition to check if 'push' is in command.script_parts and 'set-upstream' is in command.output might not cover all possible cases for a git push command. Also, the use of 'set-upstream' is a deprecated flag for the git push command.

Possible approach to fixing the bug: 

To fix the bug, we can check the command against the entire git command to ensure that 'push' is used in the correct context and 'set-upstream' is set accordingly.

Corrected code:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    parts = command.script.split()
    return 'push' in parts and 'set-upstream' not in parts
```
