The error message indicates the following:
- The function `match` is returning `True` when it shouldn't. This causes the test to fail as it expects `match` to return `False`.
- The test is checking for a case where the `command.script_parts` contain 'push' and `command.output` contains 'set-upstream'. However, the current implementation of the `match` function is not handling these conditions correctly.

The potential error location is within the `match` function, where the conditions for checking 'push' in `command.script_parts` and 'set-upstream' in `command.output` are not correctly implemented.

The reasons for the occurrence of the bug are:
- The conditions for checking 'push' in `command.script_parts` and 'set-upstream' in `command.output` are not properly evaluated.
- The implementation of the `match` function is not checking the presence of 'push' and 'set-upstream' correctly.

To fix the bug:
- We need to ensure that the `match` function checks both `command.script_parts` and `command.output` for the presence of the required strings 'push' and 'set-upstream' respectively.
- The corrected code for the `match` function is provided below:

```python
def match(command):
    return 'push' in command.script_parts and 'set-upstream' in command.output
```

With this fix, the `match` function correctly checks for the presence of 'push' in `command.script_parts` and 'set-upstream' in `command.output` and returns `True` only if both conditions are met.
