The test case `test_match_bitbucket` is checking if the `match` function returns `False` for the given command. However, the error message shows that the `match` function is returning `True` instead, which is not as expected.

The potential error location within the `match` function is the condition that checks if 'set-upstream' is in the command's output. The bug occurs because 'set-upstream' is not in the output command string, but rather contained in a separate part of the output. Therefore, the condition is evaluating to `True` when it should be `False`.

To fix the bug, we need to parse the output command and check for 'set-upstream' in the correct part of the data.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
# Corrected function code
def match(command):
    return 'push' in command.script_parts and 'set-upstream' in command.output
```

This change ensures that 'set-upstream' is checked in the `command.output` specifically, resolving the bug that caused the incorrect evaluation of the condition.
