The error occurs due to the mismatch between the conditions in the `match` function and the test case. The `match` function checks whether the script_part contains 'push' and the output contains 'set-upstream'. However, in the test case, the output contains 'set-upstream', but it is a part of the URL and not a separate string. This causes the mismatch and the assertion error in the test case.

To fix this, we can modify the `match` function to use regular expressions to match the strings in the output. This will allow more flexibility in matching the required patterns within the output.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re

def match(command):
    return ('push' in command.script_parts
            and re.search(r'set-upstream', command.output) is not None)
```

This code modifies the `match` function to use the `re.search` method to check if the output contains the substring 'set-upstream'. This allows it to match the required pattern in the output, regardless of its position within the string.
