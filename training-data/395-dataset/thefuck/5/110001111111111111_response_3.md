The bug occurs in the `match` function. The current implementation checks if the `command.script_parts` contains 'push' and if 'set-upstream' is in `command.output`. However, the expected behavior is to check if 'push' and 'set-upstream' are consecutive elements in the `command.script_parts`.

The bug occurred in the test function because the expected behavior is to not match the command, but the buggy implementation incorrectly matches it.

The bug occurs because the current implementation of the match function does not correctly match the command with 'git push origin' when 'set-upstream' is not present in the `command.output`.

To fix the bug, we need to check if 'push' and 'set-upstream' are consecutive elements in the `command.script_parts`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_5/thefuck/rules/git_push.py

@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script_parts
    return ('push' in script_parts
            and 'set-upstream' in script_parts
            and script_parts.index('push') + 1 == script_parts.index('set-upstream'))
```

This corrected function checks if 'push' and 'set-upstream' are consecutive elements in `command.script_parts`. This should address the bug and make the function behave as expected.
