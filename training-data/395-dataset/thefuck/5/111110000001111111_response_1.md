The bug is occurring in the `match` function due to an error in the condition. The function is checking if 'push' is in `command.script_parts` and 'set-upstream' is in `command.output`. However, this logic is incorrect because 'set-upstream' is not in `command.output`, it is part of the branch name in the output. Therefore, the current implementation of the function does not accurately determine whether the command is a 'git push' with '--set-upstream' option.

To fix the bug:
1. We need to check if 'push' is in `command.script_parts` and '--set-upstream' is in the correct part of `command.script`. 
2. We should also account for various formats and orderings of the arguments in the command.

```python
# Corrected function
def match(command):
    return ('git' in command.script_parts
            and 'push' in command.script_parts
            and '--set-upstream' in command.script)
```
