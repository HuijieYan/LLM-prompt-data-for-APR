The function `match` seems to be checking if the command has 'push' and 'set-upstream' within the `script_parts` and `output` attributes, respectively. But the buggy function is actually checking if 'push' is in `command.script_parts` and 'set-upstream' is in `command.output`.

The error in the function becomes apparent when it's used in the test function `test_match_bitbucket`. The assert statement `assert not match(Command('git push origin', output_bitbucket))` should return `False` because both 'push' and 'set-upstream' are present within the `command.script_parts` and `command.output`, respectively. However, the buggy function returns `True` due to incorrect attribute checks.

To fix the bug, update the function `match` to correctly check if 'push' is in `command.script_parts` and 'set-upstream' is in `command.script_parts`.

```python
def match(command):
    return ('push' in command.script_parts
            and 'set-upstream' in command.script_parts)
```
