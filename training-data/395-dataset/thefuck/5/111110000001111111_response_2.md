The buggy function `match` is supposed to check if the command includes 'git push' and 'set-upstream' in its script parts and output, respectively. However, the current implementation checks for 'push' and 'set-upstream' separately, without considering their connection to 'git'.

The bug occurs because the function is not checking for 'git push' in the `command.script_parts` and 'set-upstream' in the `command.output` together, as required.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to check for 'git push' and 'set-upstream' as a single entity in the respective variables `command.script_parts` and `command.output`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def match(command):
    return ('git push' in command.script
            and 'set-upstream' in command.output)
```

The issue 'Crash in git module' is related to this bug because the bug occurs in the '/usr/local/lib/python3.5/dist-packages/thefuck/specific/git.py' file, which is used to support git commands. The bug causes the program to crash when processing the git push command, leading to the stack trace provided.
