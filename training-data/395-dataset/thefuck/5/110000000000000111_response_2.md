Potential Error Location: The error is occurring within the `git_support` function in the `thefuck/specific/git.py` file. The `git_support` decorator is likely the source of the bug, as it is causing an `IndexError`.

Reason for Bug: The function `match` is using the `git_support` decorator, which is causing an `IndexError` when trying to extract content from the `command.output` related to the `git push` command. This is likely due to the absence of the expected content in the `command.output` causing the list index to be out of range.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: 
1. Check the `git_support` decorator to ensure that it is handling different scenarios gracefully, including cases where the output may not contain the expected content.
2. A try-except block could be used to catch the `IndexError` and handle it appropriately within the `git_support` function to prevent crashing.

Corrected Code:
```python
def git_support(fn):
    def wrapper(command):
        try:
            return fn(command)
        except IndexError:
            return None  # Handle the IndexError gracefully
    return wrapper

# Updated match function using the corrected git_support decorator
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('push' in command.script_parts
            and 'set-upstream' in command.script_parts)
```
