Potential error location:
The potential error is likely in the use of the '@git_support' decorator, which may not be defined or implemented properly.

Reason for the bug:
The '@git_support' decorator is not a standard Python decorator and may not be defined or implemented in the code.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Remove the '@git_support' decorator and call the match() function directly.
2. Implement the '@git_support' decorator to properly handle the match() function.

Corrected code:

```python
def match(command):
    return ('push' in command.script_parts
            and 'set-upstream' in command.output)
```
