Potential error location: The `match` function. The current implementation does not correctly check if the command output contains 'set-upstream'.

Reason for the bug: The current implementation uses the `in` operator to check if 'set-upstream' is in the command output. However, this does not accurately check for the presence of 'set-upstream' in the output.

Possible approach to fix the bug: We can use the `command.script` attribute to access the command output and then check if 'set-upstream' is in the output. Additionally, we can also check if 'push' is in the command script parts.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_5/thefuck/rules/git_push.py

# corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('push' in command.script
            and 'set-upstream' in command.output)
```
