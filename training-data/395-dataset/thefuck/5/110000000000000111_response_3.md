The error message indicates an "IndexError: list index out of range" at line 36 in the "get_new_command" function of the "git_push" rule file. This error occurs when the code tries to access an item from a list that does not exist.

The bug is likely occurring because the regular expression "re.findall(r'git push (.*)', command.output)" is not able to find a match in the given "command.output", resulting in an empty list, which causes the IndexError when trying to access the first item at index 0.

To fix this bug, we should first check if the list returned by "re.findall" is empty before trying to access its first item.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@git_support
def match(command):
    matches = re.findall(r'git push (.*)', command.output)
    return ('push' in command.script_parts and 'set-upstream' in command.output and matches)
```

In the corrected code, we store the result of "re.findall" in the "matches" variable and then use it as a condition in the return statement, ensuring that the list is not empty before checking the other conditions.
