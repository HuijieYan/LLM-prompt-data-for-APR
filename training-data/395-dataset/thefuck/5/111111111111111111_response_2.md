The error message indicates that the function `match` in the file `git_push.py` is causing an `AssertionError`. The `test_match_bitbucket` function is failing with the error `assert not True`.

The potential error in the `match` function is that it checks for the presence of 'push' in `command.script_parts` and 'set-upstream' in `command.output`, but it doesn't correctly handle the case when 'set-upstream' is a part of a larger word (e.g., "set-upstream" from "feature/set-upstream").

To fix the bug, the function should use a regular expression to check for the presence of 'set-upstream' as a whole word in `command.output`.

The corrected code for the `match` function is as follows:

```python
import re

@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('push' in command.script_parts
            and re.search(r'\bset-upstream\b', command.output) is not None)
```
