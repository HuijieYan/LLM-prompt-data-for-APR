The buggy function is a decorator with the name `git_support`. The issue occurs when the `match` function, decorated with `git_support`, is called with a command having "push" in the script parts and "set-upstream" in the output. However, the output that the function expects does not align with the actual output provided, resulting in the error.

The bug occurred because the condition `('push' in command.script_parts and 'set-upstream' in command.output)` is returning `True` when it should not.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `match` function to properly check for the expected output. We can compare the script and the output strings directly for a better match.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
# Fixed function
def match(command):
    return 'git push' in command.script and 'set-upstream' in command.output
```

With this fix, the `match` function will check if "git push" is in the script, and "set-upstream" is in the command output. This should resolve the bug and prevent the error from occurring.
