The test case is checking whether the `match` function returns `False` when given a Command with the script 'git push origin' and the specified output. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert not True` failed, meaning that the `match` function returned `True` when it should have returned `False`.

The potential error location in the `match` function is the condition `and 'set-upstream' in command.output`. This condition is checking if the string 'set-upstream' is present in the output, but the test case output contains the string 'set-upstream' as part of another word ('feature/set-upstream'), which causes the condition to evaluate to `True`.

To fix the bug, the condition should be changed to check for the exact word 'set-upstream' instead of just its presence. This can be achieved by modifying the condition to use the `split` function to split the output into words and then check if 'set-upstream' is one of the words in the output.

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('push' in command.script_parts
            and any('set-upstream' == word for word in command.output.split()))
```

This change ensures that 'set-upstream' is compared as a separate word in the output, resolving the bug in the `match` function.
