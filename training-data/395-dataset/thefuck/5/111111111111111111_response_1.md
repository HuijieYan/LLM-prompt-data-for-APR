The error occurs in the 'match' function defined in the file git_push.py. The function is supposed to check if the command is a git push and if it contains 'set-upstream' in its output. 

The error message from the test function indicates that the assertion is failing when it should not. It seems that the match function is incorrectly returning True for a command that does not meet the specified conditions.

The bug is occurring because the match function is incorrectly checking if 'set-upstream' is in the command output, rather than in the command.script_parts. This is leading to a mismatch between the expected behavior and the actual behavior, causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, the match function should be modified to check if 'set-upstream' is present in command.script_parts, rather than in command.output. This will ensure that the function correctly evaluates the conditions specified for identifying a match.

Here's the corrected code for the match function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('push' in command.script_parts
            and 'set-upstream' in command.script_parts)
```
