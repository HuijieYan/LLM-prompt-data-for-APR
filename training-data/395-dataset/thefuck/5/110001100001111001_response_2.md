The buggy function `match` is checking if the word "push" is in the `command.script_parts` and if "set-upstream" is in the `command.output`. However, the condition should be that "update" is in `command.script_parts` and "set-upstream" is in `command.output`. 

Here's the corrected function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('update' in command.script_parts
            and 'set-upstream' in command.output)
```

This corrected function checks if "update" is in the `command.script_parts` and if "set-upstream" is in the `command.output`, which aligns with the expected behavior described in the comments.
