The error message indicates that there is an IndexError occurring in the `get_new_command` function of the `git_push.py` file. This function is trying to extract the arguments from the output of the git command, and it seems to be failing due to incorrect parsing.

The buggy function `match` is a decorator that checks for the presence of 'push' in the `script_parts` of the command and 'set-upstream' in the `output` of the command. Based on the provided information, it seems that the `get_new_command` function in `git_push.py` is expecting a specific format in the command output, and when it doesn't find it, it causes an IndexError.

To fix this, we need to modify the `match` function to be more flexible and also update the `git_push.py` file to handle different formats of the git command output.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
def git_support(fn):
    def wrapper(command):
        return fn(command)
    return wrapper

@git_support
def match(command):
    return 'push' in command.script_parts and 'set-upstream' in command.output
```

And for the `get_new_command` function in `git_push.py`, we need to update the parsing logic to handle different command output formats and avoid the IndexError. Unfortunately, the exact code for fixing the `get_new_command` function cannot be provided based on the given information. This would require knowledge of the specific structure of the command output and the expected format for parsing.

In conclusion, to fix the bug, we need to make the `match` function more flexible and update the parsing logic in the `git_push.py` file to handle different formats of the git command output.
