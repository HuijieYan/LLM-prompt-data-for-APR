Potential Error Location:
The potential error is in the decorator @git_support. It seems like this decorator is not defined and it's causing a syntax error.

Reasons for the Bug:
The @git_support decorator is not defined in the code, and this is causing a syntax error.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Define the @git_support decorator if it is intended to be used to modify the behavior of the match function.
2. If @git_support is not necessary, remove it from the code and directly define the match function.

Corrected Code:

```python
def match(command):
    return ('push' in command.script_parts
            and 'set-upstream' in command.output)
```
In this corrected code, the @git_support decorator is removed. If the decorator is necessary, it should be defined properly.
