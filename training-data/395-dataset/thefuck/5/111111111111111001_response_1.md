The error is happening because the buggy function `match` is incorrectly implemented. It is supposed to check if the command contains 'push' in its script parts and 'set-upstream' in its output. However, the bug seems to be with the logic inside the `match` function. The current implementation checks for the strings 'push' and 'set-upstream' as literal strings, rather than as separate words. 

To fix this bug, the logic in the `match` function needs to be updated to check the presence of 'push' in the command script parts and 'set-upstream' in the command output as separate words, rather than as part of a larger string.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('push' in command.script_parts
            and any('set-upstream' in output_line for output_line in command.output.split('\n')))
```

This corrected implementation checks if 'push' is in the command script parts and if any line in the command output contains 'set-upstream' as a separate word.
