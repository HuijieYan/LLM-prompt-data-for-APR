The test case is checking if the match function returns False for the given Command object with script 'git push origin' and output containing the phrase 'set-upstream'. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert not True` failed, meaning that the match function returned True when it should have returned False.

The potential error location within the match function is the conditional statement `('push' in command.script_parts and 'set-upstream' in command.output)`. 

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is the misuse of the `command.output` attribute. The `command.script_parts` attribute does not exist, and the `command.output` attribute contains the entire output string, making it necessary to check for the phrase 'set-upstream' within the output, not as a separate attribute.

To fix the bug, the match function should be updated to check if both 'push' is in the command script and the phrase 'set-upstream' is in the command output.

Here's the corrected code for the match function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return 'push' in command.script and 'set-upstream' in command.output
```
