The bug occurs in the `match` function which checks if the command includes 'push' and 'set-upstream'. The bug is likely caused by the fact that the `command.output` is being searched for 'set-upstream' instead of `command.script_parts`.

To fix the bug, we need to change the condition to check `command.script_parts` for 'push' and 'origin' as well. 

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def match(command):
    return ('git' in command.script_parts
            and 'push' in command.script_parts
            and 'origin' in command.script_parts)
```
This will ensure that the `match` function correctly checks for 'git', 'push', and 'origin' in the `command.script_parts` list.
