The error occurs within the `match` function, specifically in the condition `('push' in command.script_parts and 'set-upstream' in command.output)`. 

The reason for the bug is that the condition is checking for the literal string 'set-upstream' in the entire output, but it should be checking for the substring 'set-upstream' to account for additional text surrounding it.

To fix the bug, the condition check should be modified to use the `in` operator to check if "set-upstream" is a substring of the output, rather than an exact match. Additionally, we need to check if "git push" is present in the command.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def match(command):
    return ('git push' in command.script and 'set-upstream' in command.output)
```
