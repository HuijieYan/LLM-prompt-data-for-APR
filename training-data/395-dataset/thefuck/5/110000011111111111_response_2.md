The error occurs because the `match` function is expecting the string `"set-upstream"` to be present in the `command.output` attribute. However, the expected value "set-upstream" does not exist in the output for the given input. The error message in the test function confirms this.

To fix this bug, the `match` function needs to be modified to check for the presence of the string "set-upstream" in the `command.script` attribute instead of the `command.output` attribute. 

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
def match(command):
    return ('push' in command.script
            and 'set-upstream' in command.script)
```

This change should resolve the bug and make the test case pass.
