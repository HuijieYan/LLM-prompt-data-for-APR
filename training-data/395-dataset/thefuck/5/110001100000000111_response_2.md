Potential error location: The error seems to occur when trying to access the first element of the list returned by re.findall. This happens because the regular expression did not match any part of the command.output.

Reasons for the bug: The regular expression used in the get_new_command function does not match the provided command.output, leading to an empty list being returned by re.findall. This causes the list index out of range error when attempting to access the first element of the empty list.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Prior to accessing the first element of the list returned by re.findall, it's necessary to check if the list is empty. If the list is empty, handle this case appropriately (e.g., return None or an empty string). 

Corrected code:
```python
import re

@git_support
def match(command):
    return 'push' in command.script_parts and 'set-upstream' in command.output

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    matches = re.findall(r'git push (.*)', command.output)
    if matches:
        arguments = matches[0].strip()
        return 'git push ' + arguments
    else:
        return None
```
