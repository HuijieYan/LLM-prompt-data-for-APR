The error occurs in the `match` function, where the code is attempting to check if the 'set-upstream' is in the output of the command. However, the error message indicates an `IndexError` related to the `re.findall` function on `command.output`, suggesting that the bug is likely located within the `match` function.

The reason for the bug is that the `re.findall` function does not find a match for the given pattern in `command.output`, leading to an empty list. As a result, accessing the first element of this empty list using index 0 causes the `IndexError`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `match` function to handle the possibility of the `re.findall` function not finding a match, thus avoiding the `IndexError`. We can also modify the condition to correctly check if 'set-upstream' is in the output of the command.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
import re

def match(command):
    push_in_script_parts = 'git' in command.script_parts and 'push' in command.script_parts
    set_upstream_in_output = 'set-upstream' in command.output

    return push_in_script_parts and set_upstream_in_output
```

This corrected code checks if both 'git' and 'push' are in the `script_parts`, and if 'set-upstream' is in the `output` of the command. This approach avoids the `IndexError` and correctly determines the match condition for the given command.
