The error occurs when the `match` function is called with the provided test case. The error message indicates that the test case is failing because the expected result is `False`, but the actual result is `True`.

The potential error location within the `match` function is in the condition `('push' in command.script_parts and 'set-upstream' in command.output)`. This condition checks if the command has 'push' in the script parts and 'set-upstream' in the output, but it is failing to properly identify the required conditions.

The bug is occurring because the condition is only checking if the 'push' and 'set-upstream' strings are present within the command, but it's not checking their specific positions or context. So, it's leading to a false positive when 'push' and 'set-upstream' appear in the command output.

To fix this bug, a more specific condition needs to be applied. We need to check if the literal sequence 'git push' and 'set-upstream' appear together in the command, and if the 'remote' is not present in the output.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
# Corrected function
def match(command):
    return ('git push' in command.script and 'set-upstream' in command.script
            and 'remote' not in command.output)
```
