The error occurs because the function  `match` is defined using a decorator `@git_support`, which is not defined in the provided code and is causing the `AssertionError` in the test case `test_match_bitbucket`.

To fix this issue, the `@git_support` decorator needs to be defined as a valid decorator function. However, there might be some other issues related to the logic inside the `match` function.

The potential error is the missing implementation of the `@git_support` decorator.

The suggested approach for fixing the bug is to remove the `@git_support` decorator, as it is not defined in the provided code. In addition, revise the logic inside the `match` function to properly check for the content in `command.output` and `command.script_parts`.

The corrected code for the problematic function `match`:
```python
def match(command):
    return ('git push' in command.script and 'set-upstream' in command.output)
```
