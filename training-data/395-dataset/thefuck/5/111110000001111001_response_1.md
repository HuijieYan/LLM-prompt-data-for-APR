The buggy function is a decorator function with the name "git_support" that takes in a "command" parameter and checks if the script_parts of the command contain 'push' and if the output contains 'set-upstream'.

The potential error in the code is the decorator "@git_support" which is not defined in the given code. It seems that the intention was to use a custom decorator "git_support" but it is not implemented in the code provided.

The bug occurred because the decorator "git_support" is not defined, hence it is causing a syntax error in the code.

To fix this issue, the decorator "git_support" should be defined or removed from the function.

Here's the corrected code without the decorator:

```python
def match(command):
    return ('push' in command.script_parts
            and 'set-upstream' in command.output)
```
