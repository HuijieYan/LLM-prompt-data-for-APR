The bug occurs in the `match` function of the `git_push.py` file when it tries to find the string 'set-upstream' in the `command.output`. The bug leads to an `IndexError` when trying to access the first element of the list returned by `re.findall`.

The reason behind the bug is that the `match` function is trying to find the string 'set-upstream' in the entire `command.output`, which may not always exist in that form.

To fix this bug, we can modify the code to check if 'set-upstream' exists as a standalone word in the `command.output`.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
import re

@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('push' in command.script_parts
            and any('set-upstream' in word for word in re.findall(r'\b\w+\b', command.output)))
```

In the corrected code, we use a regular expression to find all the standalone words in the `command.output`, and then check if 'set-upstream' exists in any of those words. This ensures that we avoid the IndexError and accurately check for the presence of the word 'set-upstream'.
