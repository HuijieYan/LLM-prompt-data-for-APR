The buggy function `match` checks if the script parts contain 'push' and if the output contains 'set-upstream'. However, the condition is not checking if 'push' and 'set-upstream' are consecutive in the script parts or the output.

The potential error location is in the `match` function where the condition is checking for the presence of 'push' and 'set-upstream' independently.

The bug occurred because the original code only checked for the presence of 'push' and 'set-upstream', but it did not verify if 'push' and 'set-upstream' were consecutive in the script parts and output.

To fix the bug, we need to check if 'push' and 'set-upstream' are consecutive in the script parts and output.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script_parts
    output = command.output

    for i in range(len(script_parts) - 1):
        if script_parts[i] == 'git' and script_parts[i+1] == 'push':
            push_index = i + 1
            break
    else:
        return False  # 'git push' not found

    if 'set-upstream' in output and output.index('set-upstream') > output.index('git push', push_index):
        return True
    else:
        return False
```
