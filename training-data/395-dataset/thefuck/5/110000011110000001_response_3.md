Potential error location: The error is likely in the match function. The function is checking if 'push' is in command.script_parts and 'set-upstream' is in command.output. However, this logic is leading to incorrect results as it's finding 'set-upstream' in the output, which is not what we want.

Reason for the bug: The match function is not correctly checking if 'push' and 'set-upstream' are separate words in the command.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Split the output and check for 'set-upstream' separately, ensuring it's a separate word.
2. An alternate approach could be to use regular expressions to match the command and output.

Corrected code:

```python
import re

def match(command):
    return ('push' in command.script_parts
            and re.search(r'\bset-upstream\b', command.output))
```
