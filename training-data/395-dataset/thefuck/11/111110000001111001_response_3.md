The potential error location within the buggy function is the line that tries to extract the push upstream information from the stderr. The error occurs because the splitting and indexing method used is not handling all cases of the stderr string.

The bug occurs because the splitting and indexing method used to extract the push upstream information from the stderr assumes that the relevant information is always located at the same position in the string. However, this is not the case for all the test scenarios provided. In some cases, the relevant information is located at different positions due to the presence of additional parameters in the `git push` command.

To fix the bug, we can modify the extraction method to handle different scenarios by using regular expressions to search for the relevant information in the stderr string.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    match = re.search(r'git push --set-upstream (.+)', command.stderr)
    if match:
        push_upstream = match.group(1)
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        return command.script  # or raise an exception, depending on the desired behavior
```
