The buggy function is failing to extract the desired git push command from the stderr of the input Command. The function is attempting to split the stderr by newline and then extract the push command from the third-to-last element, which is unreliable and prone to errors.

The bug occurs because the function relies on a fixed index (-3) to extract the push command from the stderr, which may not always be accurate. Additionally, the function is not dynamically checking for the presence of the suggested git push command in the stderr.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to dynamically extract the git push command from the stderr based on its content. It should look for the line in stderr that starts with "git push" and extract the entire command after "git" from that line.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    for line in stderr_lines:
        if line.startswith('git push'):
            push_upstream = line.strip().partition('git ')[2]
            return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    return command
```
