The test function is trying to check the output of the `get_new_command` function by passing different `Command` instances with the `stderr` attribute set to a specific value. The error message shows that the output of the `get_new_command` function for the `Command('git push -u origin', stderr=stderr)` case is not matching the expected value.

The potential error in the `get_new_command` function is the line:
```python
push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
```
This line tries to extract the upstream branch name from the `stderr` of the `command`. However, it is assuming that the upstream branch is always the third from the last line of the `stderr`, which may not always be the case.

The bug is occurring because the `stderr` format may vary and the assumption that the upstream branch name will always be at a fixed position in the `stderr` is incorrect. To fix this bug, the function should parse the `stderr` more robustly to identify the upstream branch name.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to use regular expressions to extract the upstream branch name from the `stderr` in a more flexible way.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import re

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    match = re.search(r'git push --set-upstream origin (.+)', command.stderr)
    if match:
        upstream_branch = match.group(1)
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', f"--set-upstream origin {upstream_branch}")
    else:
        # handle the case when the upstream branch is not found in stderr
        return command.script  # return the original command.script if upstream branch not found
```
