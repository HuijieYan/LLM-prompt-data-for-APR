The error message indicates that the function is not providing the expected output in the test cases. The `get_new_command` function is supposed to take a `Command` object and return a new command based on the stderr output. It seems that the bug is related to the extraction of the push upstream from the stderr output.

The potential error location within the `get_new_command` function is the line:
```python
push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
```

The reason behind the bug occurrence is that the code is trying to extract the 'git push' part from the stderr output and use it to create a new command. However, the splitting and extraction logic may not be handling the stderr output properly, leading to unexpected results.

To fix the bug, the function should specifically look for the line containing the suggestion for the correct command and extract the relevant information from it. The function can use regular expressions to extract the necessary part of the stderr output.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    suggestion_line = [line for line in command.stderr.split('\n') if line.startswith('    git push --set-upstream')][0]
    match = re.search(r'git push --set-upstream (.+)', suggestion_line)
    if match:
        push_upstream = match.group(1)
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        return command.script  # Return original command if no suggestion is found
``` 

This corrected code specifically looks for the line in the stderr output that starts with '    git push --set-upstream' and then uses a regular expression to extract the push upstream. This approach should handle the extraction of the necessary information more accurately.
