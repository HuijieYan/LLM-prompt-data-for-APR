Potential Error:

The error might occur in the line `push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]`. This code is trying to extract the upstream branch from the stderr of the command, but it is not handling cases where the stderr output does not contain the expected information.

Reason for the Bug:

The code does not check if the `command.stderr` contains the expected information before trying to split and extract the upstream branch. This can result in an index out of range error if the stderr does not contain the expected information.

Approach to Fix the Bug:

We can fix the bug by first checking if the `command.stderr` contains the expected information before trying to extract the upstream branch. This will prevent the index out of range error and handle cases where the stderr does not contain the expected information.

Corrected Code:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    if len(stderr_lines) >= 3:
        push_upstream = stderr_lines[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        # handle case where stderr does not contain the expected information
        return command.script  # or any appropriate action for the specific case
```
