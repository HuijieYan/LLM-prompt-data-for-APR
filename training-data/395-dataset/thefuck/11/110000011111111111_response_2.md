The error occurs in the `get_new_command` function. The function is attempting to retrieve the upstream option from the `command.stderr` string by splitting it and then using the negative index `[-3]` to access the third to the last element. This approach is not reliable as the number of lines in the stderr message may vary and the desired option may not always be in the same position.

The error message in the test function indicates that the expected output for `get_new_command(Command('git push -u origin', stderr=stderr))` is "git push --set-upstream origin master", but the actual output is "git push --set-upstream origin master -u origin".

To fix this bug, we can use regular expressions to extract the upstream option from the `command.stderr` string, ensuring that it is obtained reliably, regardless of the position within the string.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function using regular expressions:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    matches = re.search(r'git push --set-upstream ([^\s]+) ([^\s]+)', command.stderr)
    if matches:
        upstream_option = f'push --set-upstream {matches.group(1)} {matches.group(2)}'
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', upstream_option)
    else:
        return command.script
```

This updated code uses the `re.search` method to search for the desired pattern in the `command.stderr` string. If a match is found, it extracts the upstream option and uses it to construct the new command. If no match is found, it returns the original `command.script`.
