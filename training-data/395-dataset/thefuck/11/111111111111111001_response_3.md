The error occurs because the function `get_new_command` is incorrectly extracting the `push_upstream` value from the `command.stderr` in all cases, including the case when the `upstream_branch` is already specified in the `git push` command. This leads to the incorrect generation of the new command.

To fix the bug:
1. We need to check if the `--set-upstream` option is already present in the `command.script`. If it is present, we should not replace it with the new `push_upstream` value.
2. If the `--set-upstream` option is not present, then we should extract the `push_upstream` value from the `command.stderr` as before.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if '--set-upstream' not in script_parts:
        push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        return command.script
```

By implementing these changes, the function will correctly handle the different cases of the `git push` command and generate the expected new command in all scenarios.
