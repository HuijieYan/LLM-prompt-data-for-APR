Potential error location: The error might occur in the line where the `push_upstream` variable is assigned a value. 

Reasons for the occurrence of the bug: The bug might be occurring because the `stderr` attribute of the `command` variable does not contain the expected output, causing the `split` and `partition` methods to fail.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We can check for the presence of the expected string in the `stderr` attribute of the `command` variable before performing any operations on it.

Corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    if 'git' in command.stderr:
        push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        return command.script  # Return the original command script if the expected output is not found
```
