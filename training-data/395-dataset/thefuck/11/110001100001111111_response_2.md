The buggy function `get_new_command` is designed to extract a specific line from the `command.stderr` and use it to replace a part of the `command.script`. 

The bug lies in the method of extracting `push_upstream` from `command.stderr`. In the provided code, the function always assumes that the desired string is on the third-to-last line of `command.stderr`. This assumption is incorrect and causes the function to fail in different scenarios.

The buggy function fails when the format of the error message changes. For example, in Buggy case 2, the string '-u' in `command.script_parts` causes the desired string to not be the third-to-last, making the method to retry to access a non-existent index of `stderr.split('\n')`.

To fix the bug, a better approach for extracting `push_upstream` should be implemented. One way could be to search for the line that starts with "git push" in `command.stderr`. Once the line is found, the substring after 'git ' can be taken as the desired value for `push_upstream`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# Corrected function
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    for line in command.stderr.split('\n'):
        if line.startswith('git push'):
            push_upstream = line.partition('git ')[2]
            return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream.strip())
    return None  # Return a default value if the search fails
```
