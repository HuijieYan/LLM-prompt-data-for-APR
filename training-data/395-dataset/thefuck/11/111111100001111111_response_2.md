The buggy function `get_new_command` is trying to extract the upstream option from the `stderr` of the `command` and then replace the `push` command with this upstream option. 

The bug occurs because the code is using the wrong index to split the `stderr` and extract the upstream option. This is leading to incorrect extraction of the upstream option. 

To fix the bug, we need to update the code to correctly extract the upstream option from the `stderr` of the `command`. We can do this by splitting the `stderr` using the newline character and then extracting the relevant line that contains the upstream option.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    for line in reversed(stderr_lines):
        if line.strip().startswith('git push --set-upstream'):
            push_upstream = line.strip()
            return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    return command
```
