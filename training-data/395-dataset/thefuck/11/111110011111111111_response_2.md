The error occurs when the function is trying to replace the upstream argument in the command string. The function is splitting the `command.stderr` string and taking the third element from the end to obtain the upstream option. This isn't reliable as it depends on the specific position of the 'git' string in the error message. It should be using a different approach to extract the upstream option.

The buggy function is not handling the different scenarios of the git push command correctly. It assumes that the upstream option is always at a fixed position in the stderr string which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we need to parse the `command.stderr` string to find the proper upstream option in each case. We can use regular expressions to extract the upstream option from the stderr. Then we should replace the argument in the `command.script` with the proper upstream option.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    # Regular expression to find the upstream option
    upstream_option = re.search(r'(git push.*--set-upstream .+)', command.stderr)
    
    # Extract the upstream option from the match
    if upstream_option:
        push_upstream = upstream_option.group(1)
        return command.script.replace('push', push_upstream)
    else:
        # If no upstream option is found, return the original command
        return command.script
```

This corrected code uses regular expressions to find the proper upstream option in the `command.stderr` string. If the upstream option is found, it replaces the 'push' argument in the `command.script` with the proper upstream option. If no upstream option is found, it returns the original command script. This should fix the issue and make the function handle different scenarios of the git push command correctly.
