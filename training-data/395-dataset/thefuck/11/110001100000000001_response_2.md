Potential Error:

The potential error is in the line `push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]`. This line is trying to extract the upstream branch from the `stderr` of the `command` parameter. However, if the `stderr` is not formatted as expected, this line could throw an `IndexError` or `AttributeError`.

Reason for the Bug:

The bug occurs because the function assumes that the stderr will always contain the information it needs in a specific format.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:

1. Check if the `stderr` contains the required information before extracting it.
2. Handle cases where the stderr format is different than expected.

Corrected Code:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    if len(stderr_lines) >= 3:
        push_upstream = stderr_lines[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        # Handle cases where the stderr format is different than expected
        return command.script
```
