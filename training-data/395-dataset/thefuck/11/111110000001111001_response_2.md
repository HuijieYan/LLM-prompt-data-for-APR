The buggy function is trying to extract the upstream branch information from the error message in the command's stderr and use it to create a new command with the 'push' argument replaced with the extracted upstream information.

The potential error in the function is the line:
```python
push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
```

The bug occurs because the function always assumes that the upstream information is located in the same line in the stderr, which may not always be the case. This causes the function to incorrectly extract the upstream information, leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to properly parse the error message and extract the upstream information in a more reliable way. We can use regular expressions to extract the required information from the stderr.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    for line in stderr_lines:
        match = re.search(r'git push (.+)', line)
        if match:
            push_upstream = match.group(1)
            return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    return command.script  # handle case where upstream information is not found
```

In the corrected code, we split the stderr into lines and then use a regular expression to search for the line containing the upstream information. If found, we extract the relevant information and use it to create the new command. If the upstream information is not found, we return the original command script. This approach ensures that the function can handle different error message formats and reliably extract the required information.
