The error occurs because the function `get_new_command` is incorrectly parsing the `stderr` output and generating the new command. It currently relies on `command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]` to extract the necessary information, but this approach is not robust and can lead to incorrect results.

The bug occurs because the function assumes that the desired information will always be in the same position within the `stderr` output. However, this assumption is not valid, as the desired information could be located at different positions depending on the specific `git push` command and its corresponding `stderr` output.

To fix this bug, we need to parse the `stderr` output more robustly to extract the relevant information, i.e., the `git push` command with the appropriate upstream branch specification.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    for line in lines:
        if line.strip().startswith('git push'):
            push_upstream = line.strip().split('git push ')[1]
            return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    return command.script  # Return the original command if the specific pattern is not found
```

This corrected code iterates through the lines of the `stderr` output and looks for a line that starts with 'git push'. When found, it extracts the necessary information and uses it to build the new command. If no such line is found, it returns the original command.

This approach makes the function more robust and less dependent on the specific position of the information within the `stderr` output.
