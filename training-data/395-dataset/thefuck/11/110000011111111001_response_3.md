The potential error location within the problematic function is the line:
```python
return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the replace_argument function is not defined in the provided code. It seems that the intention is to replace the 'push' command with the 'push_upstream' variable within the 'command.script' string.

To fix the bug, you can use the `str.replace()` method to replace the 'push' command with the 'push_upstream' variable.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return command.script.replace('push', push_upstream)
```
