The error is occurring because the function is incorrectly parsing the `push_upstream` value from the `stderr` of the command. It is splitting the `stderr` using the newline character and then trying to access the third last element, which is causing issues.

The bug occurs because the function assumes the position of the `git` in the `stderr` will always be the same. This is not the case as shown in the different test cases provided.

To fix the bug, the function should use regular expression to extract the `push_upstream` value from the `stderr` of the command. This will enable it to handle different cases where the position of `git` in the `stderr` might not always be the same.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    matches = re.search(r'git push (.+)', command.stderr)
    if matches:
        push_upstream = 'push ' + matches.group(1)
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        return command.script
```

This correction uses regular expression to capture the `push_upstream` value from the `stderr`. This approach is more robust and handles different cases where the position of `git` in the `stderr` may vary.
