The issue with the `get_new_command` function is that it tries to split the `command.stderr` using the `split('\n')[-3]`, which is error-prone. The function should instead search for the line containing the required information.

The error occurs because the function assumes that the line containing the push command will always be the third line from the end. This assumption is not correct, as the position of the line containing the push command may vary depending on the error message or the stderr content.

To fix this issue, the function should search for the line containing the push command within the `command.stderr` instead of relying on its position.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    for line in stderr_lines:
        if line.startswith('    git push'):
            push_upstream = line.strip().partition('git ')[2]
            return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    return command
```

This code iterates through the lines of `command.stderr` and looks for the line starting with "git push". Once found, it extracts the push command and uses it to replace the argument in the `command.script`. If no suitable line is found, it simply returns the input command.
