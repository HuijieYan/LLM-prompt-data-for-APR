The error message from the test function indicates that the output of the function get_new_command does not match the expected output. It seems that the function is not correctly processing the stderr input.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line:
push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]

The bug is occurring because the function is trying to split the stderr by '\n' and then taking the -3 index to get the required information. However, this approach is not reliable as the structure of the stderr might change, leading to potential index out of range errors or incorrect information extraction.

To fix the bug, a more robust way of extracting the required information from the stderr needs to be used. This could involve using regular expressions to extract the relevant string after 'git push --set-upstream'.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    pattern = r'git push --set-upstream (\S+) (\S+)'
    match = re.search(pattern, command.stderr)
    if match:
        remote = match.group(1)
        branch = match.group(2)
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', f"--set-upstream {remote} {branch}")
    else:
        # Handle cases where the pattern is not found in the stderr
        return command.script
```

This corrected function uses a regular expression to extract the remote and branch information from the stderr, and then constructs the new command accordingly. This approach is more reliable and less error-prone compared to the original approach.
