The potential error in the `get_new_command` function is the line:
```python
push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
```

The bug occurs because the function is trying to split the stderr message and access the third-to-last line, then extract the words after "git" from that line. However, this approach is not reliable because if the error message format changes, the index -3 may not always contain the required information. 

A possible fix for the bug would be to use a regular expression to extract the required information from the error message. This would make the function more robust and adaptable to changes in the error message format.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    push_upstream_match = re.search(r'git push --set-upstream origin \S+', command.stderr)
    if push_upstream_match:
        push_upstream = push_upstream_match.group()
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    return command.script
```

In this corrected function, we use a regular expression to search for the required information in the error message. If a match is found, we extract the matched string and use it to replace the command.script. If no match is found, we simply return the original command.script. This approach makes the function more robust and reliable.
