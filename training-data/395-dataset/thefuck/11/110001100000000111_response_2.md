Potential error location: 

The potential error location is in the line:
push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: 

The error occurs because the function is trying to split the stderr of the command by '\n' and then accessing the third last index and extracting the string after 'git'. If the error message format changes, this code will break.

Approach for fixing the bug:

We need to find a more reliable way to extract the push target from the error message, such as using regular expressions to match the pattern of the error message.

Corrected code:

```python
import re

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    error_message = command.stderr
    match = re.search(r'git push --set-upstream (\S+)', error_message)
    if match:
        push_upstream = match.group(1)
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        return command
```
