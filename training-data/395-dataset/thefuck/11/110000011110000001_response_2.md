The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]`. This line attempts to split the `stderr` string from the `command` object and extract the necessary information. However, it assumes that the git command string always appears in the second-to-last line of the `stderr`, which may not always be the case.

The buggy function is trying to extract the desired `push_upstream` value from the `stderr` by assuming that it always appears in the second-to-last line and follows the pattern 'git <push_upstream>'. This is a fragile approach because it relies heavily on the specific format of the `stderr` output, which may vary depending on the Git version or other factors.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to search the entire `stderr` for the pattern 'git push --set-upstream'. If it finds this pattern, it should extract the next two words as the `push_upstream` value.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command):
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')

    for i in range(len(stderr_lines) - 1, -1, -1):
        if 'git push --set-upstream' in stderr_lines[i]:
            push_upstream = stderr_lines[i].split()[-2:]
            return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', ' '.join(push_upstream))
    
    return command.script  # return the original command script if the pattern is not found
```

This modification searches for the 'git push --set-upstream' pattern in the `stderr` and extracts the next two words as the `push_upstream` value. If the pattern is not found, it returns the original command script. This approach is more robust and less likely to break if the format of the `stderr` changes.
