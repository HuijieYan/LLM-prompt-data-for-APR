The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line `push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]`. This line is splitting the `stderr` string and accessing the third last element to extract the push upstream information. However, in the test case, the `stderr` string provided does not always have the same structure, which is causing the function to fail.

The error occurs because the function is relying on a specific position within the `stderr` string to extract the push upstream information, assuming that it will always be in the same format. However, the `stderr` string can vary, and the specific line that the function is trying to access might not always be in the same position.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to parse the `stderr` string in a more robust way, ensuring that it can handle different formats of the `stderr` string and reliably extract the push upstream information.

Corrected function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    for line in stderr_lines:
        if line.startswith('    git push --set-upstream'):
            push_upstream = line.strip().split()[-2:]
            return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', ' '.join(push_upstream))
    return command.script  # If the line is not found, return the original command
```
