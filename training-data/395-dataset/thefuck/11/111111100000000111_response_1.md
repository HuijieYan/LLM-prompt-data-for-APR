The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]`. This line seems to be attempting to parse the error message and retrieve the suggested command for git push, but it is flawed in its implementation.

The error is occurring because the function is trying to extract the suggested command from `command.stderr` based on a hardcoded assumption about its position within the error message. This approach is not robust and will fail if the error message format changes.

To fix the bug, the function should parse the error message in a more robust way, for example by using regular expressions to extract the command suggestion. This approach will be more reliable and adaptable to changes in the error message format.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import re

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    error_message = command.stderr
    match = re.search(r'git push (--set-upstream)? (\S+)', error_message)
    if match:
        push_upstream = match.group(0)
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        # Handle the case where the error message format does not match the expected pattern
        return command
```
