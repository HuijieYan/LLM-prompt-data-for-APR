The error is likely occurring in the `get_new_command` function. The error is likely due to the incorrect parsing of the stderr output from the `git push` command.

The bug is likely occurring because the function assumes that the stderr output will always be in the expected format, which may not always be the case. In this specific case, the error message "fatal: The current branch tmp has no upstream branch." is being split into lines, and the third last line is used to extract the push_upstream value. However, if the error message format changes, the function will likely fail.

To fix this bug, we can update the function to handle different error message formats and use a more robust method to extract the push_upstream value.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def get_new_command(command):
    error_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    for line in error_lines:
        if 'fatal: The current branch' in line and 'has no upstream branch' in line:
            push_upstream = line.split('use ')[1].split('\n')[0]
            return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    return "Error: Unable to parse git push error message"
```

In the corrected code, we first split the stderr into lines and then iterate through each line to find the specific error message. Once the error message is found, we extract the push_upstream value using a more robust method.

This should address the bug and make the function more resilient to changes in the error message format.
