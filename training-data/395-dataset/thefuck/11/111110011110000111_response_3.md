The error occurs because the 'push_upstream' value is being extracted from the stderr in a way that does not correctly handle the case when the command is 'git push -u origin'. The partition function only returns two elements (pre-partition, separator, post-partition), so in the case of 'git push -u origin', the 'push_upstream' variable incorrectly includes the '-u origin' part.

To fix the bug, we can use regular expressions to extract the correct 'push_upstream' value from the stderr.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    match = re.search(r'git push (--\S+ )?([^:]+)', command.stderr)
    if match:
        push_upstream = match.group(0)
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        # handle the case when the regex pattern does not match
        return command.script
```

The regular expression pattern 'git push (--\S+ )?([^:]+)' will correctly extract the 'push_upstream' value, handling the case when there are additional parameters like '-u origin'. This should fix the bug and make the code work as expected.
