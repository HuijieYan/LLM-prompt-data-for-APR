The error is likely occurring in the `get_new_command` function, specifically in the line:
```python
push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
```

The error occurs because the function is trying to split the `stderr` output of the `command` and access the third to last line, and then look for 'git ' in that line. However, the error message format seems to have changed, and this method of extracting the push upstream suggestion is no longer valid. 

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic of how the `push_upstream` suggestion is extracted from the `command.stderr`. We may need to find a new way to extract the `push_upstream` suggestion that is reliable and not susceptible to changes in the error message format.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    error_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    for line in error_lines:
        if 'git push' in line.lower() and '--set-upstream' in line:
            push_upstream = line.strip().split('git push ')[-1]
            return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    return command
```

This updated code splits the `stderr` into lines and then checks each line to find the 'git push' command with '--set-upstream'. If found, it extracts the push upstream suggestion and replaces it in the original command, as per the intention of the function. If not found, it returns the original command. This approach should be more robust against changes in the error message format.
