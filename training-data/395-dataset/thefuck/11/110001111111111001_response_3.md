The error occurs because the buggy function is not correctly handling the different cases of the `git push` command. It is trying to extract the new command from the error message, which is not reliable and is causing the function to fail for different input scenarios.

The buggy function is trying to extract the new command from the error message by splitting the `stderr` and taking the last but two line, this is not a robust approach because the error message can vary and the required message might not always be at the same position in the `stderr`.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to consider the different cases of the `git push` command and construct the new command accordingly.

Below is the corrected function/method:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if 'fatal' in command.stderr:
        push_upstream = command.stderr.split('git push')[1].split('\n')[1].strip()
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        return command.script
```

This modification directly searches for 'git push' in the `stderr` and takes the immediately following line as the new command. If no error is found in the `stderr`, it returns the original command. This approach avoids hardcoding specific positions of the output and is more robust.
