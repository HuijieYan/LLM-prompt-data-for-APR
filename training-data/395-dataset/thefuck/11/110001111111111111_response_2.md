The error occurs because the function is incorrectly splitting the `command.stderr` string to extract the required information. It seems to be splitting based on the newline character, but the splitting logic is not handling the different formats of the input string properly. 

The buggy function `get_new_command` is failing to split the `command.stderr` string correctly and extract the necessary information to form the new command. This is causing the incorrect output in the test case.

To fix this, we need to update the logic for extracting the information from the `command.stderr` string. We should look for the line that contains the suggestion for the correct command and extract that information.

Here's the updated and corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    for line in command.stderr.split('\n'):
        if line.startswith("    git push --set-upstream "):
            push_upstream = line.strip().partition('git ')[2]
            return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    return command.script  # Return the original script if the suggestion is not found
```

With this updated approach, the function will correctly extract the suggestion for the new command from the `command.stderr` string and use it to form the new command. This should address the bug and produce the expected output in the test cases.
