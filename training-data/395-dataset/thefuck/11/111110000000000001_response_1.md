Potential Error Location:
The potential error is likely in the line `push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]`. 

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The error may occur due to the assumption that the `stderr` attribute of the `command` object always contains the information needed to extract `push_upstream`, which may not be the case. It's also possible that the `stderr` format may vary depending on the git command used, leading to incorrect extraction of the `push_upstream`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check for the presence of 'git' in `stderr` before extracting `push_upstream`.
2. Error handling to ensure that the correct information is extracted regardless of variations in the `stderr` format.

Corrected code:

```python
import re

def git_support(func):
    def wrapper(command):
        push_upstream = None
        for line in command.stderr.split('\n'):
            if 'git ' in line:
                push_upstream = line.strip().partition('git ')[2]
                break
        if push_upstream:
            return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
        else:
            return "Error: Could not find git command in stderr"
    return wrapper

def get_new_command(command):
    return git_support(command)
```
