The buggy function `get_new_command` tries to extract the push command with its arguments from the stderr of the `command`. However, it is assuming that the push command and its arguments are always on the third line from the end, which is not always the case. This assumption leads to errors when the stderr message structure changes.

To fix this bug, the function needs to check each line of the `stderr` to find the line that contains the push command and its arguments. Once this line is found, the function should extract the push command and use it to replace the old push command in `command.script`.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    for line in reversed(stderr_lines):
        if line.startswith('git push'):
            push_upstream = line.strip().partition('git ')[2]
            return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    return command
```

In the corrected code, we split the `stderr` into lines and iterate through them in reverse order. This allows us to find the line containing the push command and its arguments. Once found, the push command is extracted and used to replace the old push command in `command.script`.

This approach ensures that the function adapts to different structures of the `stderr` message and accurately extracts the push command and its arguments.
