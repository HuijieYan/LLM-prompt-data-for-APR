The error message indicates that the test is failing because the expected output does not match the actual output. The problem seems to be related to how the "git push -u origin" command is being handled.

The potential error location within the get_new_command function is in the line that splits the stderr and extracts the push_upstream value.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the original function is not correctly extracting the push_upstream value from the stderr.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to use regular expressions to extract the push_upstream value instead of simply splitting the stderr.

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command):
    # Using regular expression to extract the push_upstream value
    push_upstream_match = re.search(r'git push --set-upstream (.+)', command.stderr)
    
    if push_upstream_match:
        push_upstream = push_upstream_match.group(1)
        return command.script.replace('push', f'push {push_upstream}')
    else:
        return command.script
```

In this corrected code, the re.search method is used to search for the pattern "git push --set-upstream" in the command.stderr. If a match is found, the captured group (push_upstream) is used to replace the 'push' argument in the command.script. If no match is found, the original command.script is returned. This approach should correctly handle the extraction of the push_upstream value from the stderr.
