Potential error location:
The error is likely occurring on this line:
push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The function is attempting to extract the push_upstream value from the stderr of the command by splitting it and then extracting specific index. However, this approach is error-prone because it assumes the exact position of the required information in the stderr, which can vary depending on the output of the command.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use regular expressions to parse the stderr and extract the push_upstream value.
2. Check for more robust ways to obtain the required information from the command output.
3. Handle potential error cases when extracting push_upstream to avoid index out of range errors.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import re

# this is the correct and fixed function
def get_new_command(command):
    match = re.search(r'git push --set-upstream (.+)', command.stderr)
    if match:
        push_upstream = match.group(1)
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    else:
        # handle the case when push_upstream is not found in the stderr
        return None  # or return an error message, depending on the requirements
```
