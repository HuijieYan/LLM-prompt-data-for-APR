The error message from the test case indicates that there is an issue with the comparison of the expected output and the actual output of the `get_new_command` function. The assertion fails when the input command is `git push -u origin`.

The potential error location within the `get_new_command` function is likely the line where the `push_upstream` variable is being assigned. It seems that the function is incorrectly parsing the stderr message to retrieve the upstream branch information.

The bug occurred because the function incorrectly assumed that the upstream branch information can always be obtained from the stderr message by splitting it at a certain position. However, the position where the upstream branch information is located in the stderr message can vary, leading to incorrect parsing and mismatched output.

To fix this bug, the function should use a more robust method to extract the upstream branch information from the stderr message. One approach could be to use regular expressions to search for the upstream branch information pattern in the stderr message.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import re

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    stderr_lines = command.stderr.split('\n')
    for line in stderr_lines:
        match = re.search(r'git push --set-upstream (.+)', line)
        if match:
            push_upstream = match.group(1)
            return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', push_upstream)
    return command.script  # If no match is found, return the original command script
```
