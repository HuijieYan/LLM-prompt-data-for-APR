The buggy function attempts to extract the suggestion for updating the upstream branch from the error message `command.stderr` and then replaces the 'push' command in `command.script` with this suggestion. However, it seems that the function assumes the error message will always contain the suggestion in the specific format it is looking for. 

In cases where the `stderr` contains the suggestion, the function attempts to extract it by splitting the string and getting the third last element. This approach is unreliable and can break if the error message format changes.

To fix the bug, the function should instead look for the suggestion in a more robust way, perhaps by using regular expressions to extract the suggestion from the error message. This approach would make the function more resilient to changes in the format of the error message.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import re

@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    suggestion_match = re.search(r'git push (--set-upstream|\-u) [^\s]+ [^\s]+', command.stderr)
    if suggestion_match:
        suggestion = suggestion_match.group(0)
        return replace_argument(command.script, 'push', suggestion)
    else:
        return command
```

This corrected function uses a regular expression to search for the suggestion pattern in the `command.stderr` and extracts the suggestion if found. It then uses this suggestion to replace the push command in the script. This approach makes the function more robust and less likely to break if the error message format changes.
