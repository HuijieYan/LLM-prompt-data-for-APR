The potential error in the provided function is that it is attempting to access the 'script' attribute of the 'command' object directly without checking if it exists. This can lead to an AttributeError if the 'script' attribute is not present in the 'command' object.

To fix this issue, we need to first check if the 'script' attribute exists in the 'command' object before attempting to access it.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
# corrected function
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if hasattr(command, 'script'):
        return '{} --staged'.format(command.script)
    else:
        return '{} --staged'.format(command)
```

In the corrected code, we use the `hasattr` function to check if the 'script' attribute exists in the 'command' object. If it does, we use it in the return statement. If it doesn't exist, we use the 'command' object itself in the return statement as a fallback.
