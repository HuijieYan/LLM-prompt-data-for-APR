The error in the function is caused by the incorrect use of the `command.script` attribute. The function is trying to access the `script` attribute directly from the `command` object, but in reality, the `script` attribute is nested within the `command` object.

To fix this issue, we need to access the `script` attribute from the `command` object correctly.

Updated code for the function:

```python
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return '{} --staged'.format(command.script)
```

Alternatively, we can also directly access the `script` attribute from the `command` object to make the function more robust:

```python
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return '{} --staged'.format(command)
```

This will ensure that the `script` attribute from the `command` object is used correctly to generate the new command.
