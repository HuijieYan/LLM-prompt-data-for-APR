Potential error: The function is not using the `command` parameter or the `settings` parameter, and is instead trying to access the `command.script` attribute which may not exist.

Reason behind the bug: The function is not utilizing the `command` and `settings` parameters, and instead is trying to access an attribute that may not exist.

Approach for fixing the bug: Utilize the `command` and `settings` parameters to create the new command.

Corrected code:

```python
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return command.script + ' --staged'
```
