The issue with the `get_new_command` function is that it is attempting to access the `script` attribute of the `command` object, which does not exist. Instead, the `command` object has a `script` attribute and should be accessed directly.

The reason for the bug is that the `get_new_command` function is attempting to access a non-existent attribute of the `command` object. This is causing the function to format the string incorrectly, resulting in the wrong output.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `get_new_command` function to access the `script` attribute of the `command` object directly and then format the string with the `--staged` flag.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return '{} --staged'.format(command.script)
```

With this modification, the function will correctly access the `script` attribute of the `command` object and add the `--staged` flag to it. This should address the bug and make the test cases pass.
