The bug is in the `get_new_command` function. The function appends `--staged` to the end of the command.script, regardless of whether the command already contains arguments.

The error message from the test function shows that when the command argument is 'git diff foo', the buggy function returns 'git diff foo --staged', when it should actually return 'git diff --staged foo'.

To fix this bug, the function should consider the arguments passed in the command while adding `--staged` to the command.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_31/thefuck/rules/git_diff_staged.py

@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return '{} --staged {}'.format(command.script, ' '.join(command.script_parts[1:]))
```

In the corrected function, I used `command.script_parts[1:]` to get all the arguments after the initial command, and then joined them together with spaces. This ensures that `--staged` is added after the initial command and its arguments. This approach fixes the bug and should now return the correct new command.
