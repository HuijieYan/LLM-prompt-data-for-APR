The bug in the `get_new_command` function is that it is trying to access the `script` attribute of the `command` object, but the `command` object does not have a `script` attribute. Instead, the `script` value should be accessed directly from the `command` object.

The buggy function is attempting to access the `script` attribute of the `command` object and append `--staged` to it. However, the `script` is not an attribute of the `command` object, instead it is a value within the `command` object. 

To fix this bug, we need to change the way the `command` value is used, and directly concatenate the `command` value with `--staged`.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return '{} --staged'.format(command.script)
```
