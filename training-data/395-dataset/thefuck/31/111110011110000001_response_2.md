The error in the function `get_new_command` is that it is attempting to access the attribute `script` from the `command` parameter, but `command` is an object of the class `Command` and does not have a `script` attribute. Instead, it has a `command` attribute that should be used.

The reason behind the bug is that the function is attempting to access the wrong attribute from the `command` object.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to use the `command.command` attribute instead of `command.script`.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
# Corrected function
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return '{} --staged'.format(command.command)
```
