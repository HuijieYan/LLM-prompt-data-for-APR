The potential error in the given buggy function is that it is trying to access the `script` attribute of the `command` object directly, which is not the correct way to access it.

Reason for the bug:
The bug occurs because the `command` object is of type `Command`, and the `script` attribute is accessed incorrectly. 

Approach for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to access the `script` attribute of the `command` object using `command.script` instead of `command.script`.

Corrected code:
```python
# this is the corrected function
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return '{} --staged'.format(command.script)
```
