The problem lies in the `get_new_command` function. The function is using `command.script` instead of just `command` to access the script attribute of the `Command` object. This causes the function to add `--staged` in the wrong position when `command.script` contains additional arguments.

To fix this issue, the function should directly access the `script` attribute of the `command` object and append `--staged` to it.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return '{} --staged'.format(command.script)
```

By accessing `command.script` directly, the function will properly append `--staged` to the git command without affecting the position of the original arguments.
