The error occurs because the `get_new_command` function incorrectly appends '--staged' to the provided command's `script` attribute. Instead, it should simply return the provided command with '--staged' appended to it as a string.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to directly append '--staged' to the provided command.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return f'{command.script} --staged'
```
