The buggy function `get_new_command` takes a `Command` object and a `settings` parameter, and it's expected to return a modified command with `--staged` appended to it. However, the bug in the function is that it only appends `--staged` to the original command without considering removing any existing options or arguments.

The test case provides input parameters where the original command has additional content (`foo`), and the buggy function simply appends `--staged` without considering the existing content, causing the mismatch between the expected and actual new command.

To fix this bug, the function needs to consider the existing content of the `command.script` and correctly add `--staged` to the modified command. This can be achieved by splitting the original command and appending `--staged` at the appropriate position.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    parts = command.script.split(' ')
    if len(parts) > 1:
        parts.insert(1, '--staged')
    else:
        parts.append('--staged')
    return ' '.join(parts)
```

With this correction, the function properly handles commands with additional arguments or options, and it appends `--staged` at the correct position.
