The test case is checking the `get_new_command` function for the `git diff` command, and the expected new command is `'git diff --staged'`. The error message shows that the actual result is `'git diff foo --staged'`, which is not the expected result of `'git diff --staged foo'`. This suggests that the function is not correctly appending `--staged` to the command script.

The potential error location within the `get_new_command` function is the return statement: `return '{} --staged'.format(command.script)`. This statement is simply appending `' --staged'` to the given `command.script`. The issue is that it should be appending `' --staged'` after the `command.script` instead of before it.

The bug occurs because the `--staged` option should be appended at the end of the command, but the current implementation adds it before the command script.

To fix the bug, the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function is as follows:

```python
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return '{} --staged'.format(command.script if command.script else '')
```

This code handles the case where `command.script` might be empty.
