Potential error location: The return statement is not correctly formatting the new command with the `--staged` option.

Reason for the bug: The function is missing the correct formatting to append the `--staged` option to the command.

Approaches for fixing the bug: We need to use the `shell` attribute of the `Command` object to correctly append the `--staged` option to the command.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_31/thefuck/rules/git_diff_staged.py

# This is the corrected function
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return command.script + ' --staged'
```
