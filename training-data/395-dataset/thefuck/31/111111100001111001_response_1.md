Potential Error Location:
The buggy line of code is the return statement in the function `get_new_command`. This line attempts to access the `script` attribute of the `command` object, which may not exist in the `command` object.

Reason for the Bug:
The `command` object does not have a `script` attribute, so attempting to access `command.script` will result in an AttributeError.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
Instead of trying to access the `script` attribute of the `command` object, the correct approach would be to directly use the `command` value and append the `--staged` flag to it.

Corrected Code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_31/thefuck/rules/git_diff_staged.py

# corrected function
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return f"{command} --staged"
```
