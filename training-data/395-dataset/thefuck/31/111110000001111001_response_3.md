The buggy function is using the `command` parameter incorrectly. It's trying to access the `script` attribute of `command` directly, but `command` is an object of type `Command`, and `script` is an attribute of the `Command` class.

The reason for the bug is that the `command` object is not being used properly to access the `script` attribute.

To fix the bug, the `script` attribute should be accessed directly from the `command` object, and the `--staged` flag should be added to it.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import utils

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return '{} --staged'.format(command.script)
```

By removing the `@utils.git_support` decorator and importing `utils` at the top of the file, the function can now access the `script` attribute of the `command` object directly.
