The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to modify the input command by adding `--staged` to its script. However, the function is using `command.script` directly, which is causing an AttributeError because `command` is an instance of `Command` and does not have a `script` attribute.

To fix this, we need to access the `script` attribute of the `command` object, rather than the `command` object itself.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
# corrected function
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return '{} --staged'.format(command.script)
```

By accessing the `script` attribute of the `command` object, we can correctly modify the input command by adding `--staged` to its script.
