The potential error in the provided function is that there is a reference to `command.script` which seems to be incorrect. 

From the given code, it looks like `command` is an object with a `script` attribute, and the intention is to append `--staged` to the `script`. However, it appears that `command.script` may not be the correct attribute to access.

To fix the function, we need to access the correct attribute from the `command` object to get the script and append `--staged` to it.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
# Corrected function
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return '{} --staged'.format(command)
```

In the corrected code, we are assuming that the `command` object itself represents the script, and we are appending `--staged` to it. If `command` is an object with a `script` attribute, then the corrected code might be:

```python
# Corrected function
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return '{} --staged'.format(command.script)
```
