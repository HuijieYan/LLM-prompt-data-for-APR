Potential error: The function get_new_command is using a decorator @utils.git_support, but the functionality of this decorator is not implemented.

Reason for the bug: The decorator @utils.git_support is being used without a corresponding implementation, which can cause the function to fail or produce unexpected results.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define the necessary functionality for the decorator @utils.git_support.
2. Remove the decorator @utils.git_support if it is not required.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return '{} --staged'.format(command.script)
```
