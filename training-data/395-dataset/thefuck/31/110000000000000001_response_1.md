Potential error location: The error is likely to be in the line `return '{} --staged'.format(command.script)` as it is trying to access the `script` attribute of `command`, which may not exist.

Reason for the bug: The function is trying to access an attribute `script` of the `command` object, but it might not exist or might not be the correct attribute to access.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Check if the `command` object has a different attribute that should be accessed instead of `script`. Additionally, handle the case where the `script` attribute might not exist on the `command` object.

Corrected code:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return '{} --staged'.format(command)
```
