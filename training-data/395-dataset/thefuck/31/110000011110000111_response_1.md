The error occurs because the `get_new_command` function is incorrectly formatting the output. It is adding `--staged` at the end of the command instead of before any arguments that might be provided.

To fix this issue, the `--staged` flag needs to be added before any other arguments in the command.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return 'git {} --staged'.format(command.script)
```

With this correction, the `--staged` flag will be added before any arguments in the command, as intended.
