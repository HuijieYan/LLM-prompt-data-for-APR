Error:
The buggy function is using `command.script` directly without considering the `command` object's properties.

Reason for the Bug:
The buggy function is trying to access the `script` attribute directly from the `command` object, which is not the correct way to access it.

Approach to Fix the Bug:
We need to update the function to access the `script` attribute from the `command` object properly. We can use the `settings` parameter and access the `script` attribute from the `command` object directly.

Corrected code:

```python
# Corrected function
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return '{} --staged'.format(settings.script)
```
