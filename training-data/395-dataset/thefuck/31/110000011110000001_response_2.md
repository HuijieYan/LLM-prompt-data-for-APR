The error occurs because the function `get_new_command` is not correctly joining the `command.script` and `--staged` in the return statement. Instead of adding `--staged` to the end of the `command.script`, it is adding it to the end of the entire `command` object.

To fix this bug, we need to access the `script` attribute of the `command` object and append `--staged` to it. 

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return '{} --staged'.format(command.script)  # Notice the change here
```
