The buggy function `get_new_command` is attempting to access the `script` attribute of the `command` parameter, but it is not defined as an attribute of the `command` object. Additionally, the function is decorated with `@utils.git_support`, suggesting that it may require specific behavior related to the `git` command.

To fix the bug:
1. Define the `script` attribute for the `Command` class, or access the `script` attribute directly from the `command` object.
2. Handle the `--staged` flag as required by the `@utils.git_support` decorator.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if isinstance(command, Command):
        if command.script.startswith('git'):
            return f'{command.script} --staged'
    return command
```
