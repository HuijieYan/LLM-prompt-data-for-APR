The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to add the `--staged` option to the command script provided. However, the bug is that it is accessing `command.script` instead of `command`. It should be using `command` instead of `command.script`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is trying to access `command.script` directly, which is incorrect as it is an attribute of the `command` object.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to use the `command` object directly and add the `--staged` option to the command.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_31/thefuck/rules/git_diff_staged.py

# corrected function
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return Command(script='{} --staged'.format(command.script), stdout='', stderr='')
```
