The bug in the provided function is that it is trying to access the `script` attribute of the `command` object directly, which is not a valid attribute. We need to access the `script` attribute from the `command` object itself.

The code is trying to access `command.script`, which is not a valid attribute. Instead, it should access `command.script` from the `command` object. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to access the `script` attribute from the `command` object directly, rather than through `command.script`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# fixed function
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return 'git {} --staged'.format(command.script)
```
