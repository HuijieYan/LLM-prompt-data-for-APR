The potential error location within the problematic function is the line: 

```python
return '{} --staged'.format(command.script)
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `git diff` command should be transformed to `git diff --staged`, but the buggy function currently appends `--staged` at the end of the command, instead of just after the command.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the way the `--staged` parameter is added to the command.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    new_command = command.script.split(' ')
    new_command.insert(2, '--staged')
    return ' '.join(new_command)
```

This corrected code splits the command into its separate parts, inserts the `--staged` parameter at the correct position, and then joins the parts back together.
