The error occurs because the `get_new_command` function appends the `--staged` flag to the end of the command.script, rather than before any additional arguments. This results in the original arguments being placed after the `--staged` flag, which is not the intended behavior.

To fix this bug, the `--staged` flag should be appended before any additional arguments.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_31/thefuck/rules/git_diff_staged.py

@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return '{} --staged {}'.format(command.script, ' '.join(command.args))
```
