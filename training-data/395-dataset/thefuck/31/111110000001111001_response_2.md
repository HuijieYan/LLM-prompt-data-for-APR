The buggy function has a decorator `@utils.git_support` which indicates that it should have some additional code related to git support. 

The potential error location within the problematic function is the usage of `command.script` without taking into account any git related actions. This is likely to cause an error because the function is attempting to access a property `script` of the `command` object without considering the git support.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to properly use the git support functionality and incorporate the `command.script` property within it.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return '{} diff --staged'.format(command.script)
```

In this corrected code, the `git diff --staged` command is applied to the `command.script` property within the `get_new_command` function, as expected with the `git_support` decorator.
