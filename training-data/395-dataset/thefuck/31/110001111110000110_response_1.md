# Corrected function/module
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_31/thefuck/rules/git_diff_staged.py

# this is the corrected function
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return '{} --staged'.format(command.script) if not command.script.endswith('--staged') else command.script

```
In the corrected function, we are checking if the command already ends with "--staged" before adding it again. This will prevent the incorrect concatenation of the command and "--staged" that was causing the assertion error in the test function.
