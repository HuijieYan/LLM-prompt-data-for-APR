The error occurs because the `get_new_command` function is not correctly formatting the command.script. It is adding `--staged` at the end of the script instead of after 'git diff'.

To fix this bug, the `get_new_command` function needs to correctly format the command.script by adding `--staged` after the 'git diff' command.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return '{} --staged{}'.format(command.script, ' ' + command.args if command.args else '')
```

This corrected function will add `--staged` after the 'git diff' command and then append any additional arguments passed in the command.
