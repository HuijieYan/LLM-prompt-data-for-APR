Potential error location: The error is likely in the return statement of the function `get_new_command`, where `command.script` is being used.

Reason for the bug: The bug is caused by attempting to access the `script` attribute of the `command` object. It seems that `command.script` is not a valid attribute or method of the `command` object.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: It appears that `command` is expected to be an object with a `script` attribute, but since it's not defined, it needs to be checked or modified to ensure that the correct attribute or method is being used.

Corrected code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_31/thefuck/rules/git_diff_staged.py

# corrected function
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return '{} --staged'.format(command)
```
