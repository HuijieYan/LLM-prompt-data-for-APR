The error occurs because the function `get_new_command` is not properly implemented. The function is trying to access the `script` attribute of the `command` object, which doesn't exist. This is leading to the incorrect behavior when creating the new command string.

To fix this, the function should be modified to accept the `command` object properly and then modify the `script` attribute.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return f'{command.script} --staged'
```

By using f-strings, we can directly access the `script` attribute of the `command` object, and this will resolve the issue.

With this change, when calling `get_new_command` with the provided `Command` objects, the correct output — `git diff --staged` and `git diff --staged foo` — will be produced, resolving the error in the test case.
