Potential error location: The function is attempting to access the `script` attribute of the `command` object, but it does not exist.

Reason behind the bug: The `command` object does not have a `script` attribute, so attempting to access it will result in an error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the `script` attribute exists before trying to access it, and handle the case where it does not exist.
2. Determine the correct attribute to use in place of `script` if it does not exist.

Corrected code:
```python
# this is the corrected function
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return '{} --staged'.format(command)
```
