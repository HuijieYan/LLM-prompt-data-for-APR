The bug in the provided function is that it is using a decorator `@utils.git_support` which is not defined in the code. This is causing a `NameError` when the function is called. 

To fix this bug, the decorator `@utils.git_support` needs to be defined or removed from the function. If it is a valid decorator, it should be imported and used appropriately. If it is not needed, then the function should be modified to remove the decorator.

Here is the corrected code with the decorator removed:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return '{} --staged'.format(command.script)
```
