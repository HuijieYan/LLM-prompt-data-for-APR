The potential error in the provided code is that the `@utils.git_support` decorator is applied to the `get_new_command` function, but the `utils` module or class is not defined or imported anywhere in the code. This will result in a NameError because Python cannot find the `utils` module or class.

To fix this bug, the `utils` module or class needs to be imported before using the `@utils.git_support` decorator.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import utils

@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return '{} --staged'.format(command.script)
```

In this corrected code, the `utils` module is imported before using the `@utils.git_support` decorator, which should resolve the NameError and fix the bug.
