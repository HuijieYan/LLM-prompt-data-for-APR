The potential error location in the given function is the use of `command.script` without considering the input parameter `command` and its structure. The function is supposed to return a new command by appending `--staged` to the original command, but it's incorrectly accessing the `script` attribute of the `command` parameter.

The bug occurs because the function is trying to access the attribute `script` directly from the `command` parameter, assuming it is a simple string, but in reality, it is an object of type `Command` with multiple attributes.

To fix the bug, the function needs to access the `script` attribute from the `command` parameter. Additionally, it should return a new instance of `Command` with the modified script.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    new_script = '{} --staged'.format(command.script)
    return Command(new_script, command.stdout, command.stderr)
```

This corrected code takes the `script` attribute from the `command` parameter, modifies it with `--staged`, and creates a new instance of `Command` with the modified script, along with the original `stdout` and `stderr` attributes.
