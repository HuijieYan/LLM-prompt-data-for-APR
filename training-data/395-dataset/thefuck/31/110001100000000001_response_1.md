Potential error location: The issue is with the line `return '{} --staged'.format(command.script)` where `command.script` is not a valid attribute.

Reason for the bug: The code is trying to access a non-existing attribute `script` of the `command` object.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We need to check the correct attribute of the `command` object that contains the command script.

```python
# Corrected function
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return '{} --staged'.format(command.script)

# Assuming the correct attribute is 'script' of the command object
```
