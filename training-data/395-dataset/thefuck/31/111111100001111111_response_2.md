The buggy function is trying to modify the input `command` by appending `--staged` to the `command.script`, but it's not updating the `command` itself. The function is returning the modified script instead of the updated `command` object.

To fix this, the function should create a new `command` object with the modified script and return that instead.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
@utils.git_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    new_script = '{} --staged'.format(command.script)
    return Command(script=new_script, stdout=command.stdout, stderr=command.stderr)
```
