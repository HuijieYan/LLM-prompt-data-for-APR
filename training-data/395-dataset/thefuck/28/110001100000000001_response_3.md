Potential error location: The error is likely occurring at the line `m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)` where the `_search` function is being called with incorrect parameters.

Reason for the bug: The `_search` function is being called with `command.stderr` and `command.stdout` as parameters, but the `_search` function does not accept any parameters.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Modify the `_search` function to accept a string parameter and then update the `get_new_command` function to call the `_search` function with the appropriate parameters.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_28/thefuck/rules/fix_file.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def _search(output):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# this is the corrected function
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)
    
    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                     m.group('file'),
                                     m.group('line'))
    return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
```
