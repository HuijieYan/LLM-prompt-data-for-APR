Potential error location: The `_search` function is not defined, so the `m` variable will not be assigned a value.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The `_search` function is not defined and it seems to be intended to search for patterns in the command's stderr or stdout.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Define the `_search` function to search for patterns in the command's stderr or stdout and return the match.
- Error check to ensure that the `m` variable has a valid value before using it.

Corrected code:

```python
import re
import os

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    def _search(text):
        # define the pattern to search for here
        pattern = r'your_pattern_here'
        return re.search(pattern, text)

    match = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    if match:
        editor_call = f'{os.environ["EDITOR"]} {match.group("file")} +{match.group("line")}'
        return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
    else:
        return ""  # or handle the case when no match is found
```
