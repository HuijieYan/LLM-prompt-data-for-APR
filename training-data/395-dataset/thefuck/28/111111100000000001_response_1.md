Potential error:
The function get_new_command is calling a private function _search without importing the necessary module and defining the _search function.

Reason for the bug:
The _search function is being called without being defined or imported, which will result in a NameError.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Import the necessary module for the _search function.
2. Define the _search function within the same file or import it from another file.

Corrected code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_28/thefuck/rules/fix_file.py

import os

# Define the _search function
def _search(stderr):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# Corrected get_new_command function
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)
    
    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                     m.group('file'),
                                     m.group('line'))
    return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
```
