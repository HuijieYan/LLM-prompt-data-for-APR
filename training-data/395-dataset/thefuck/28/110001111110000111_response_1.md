The error is occurring because the function `get_new_command` is not properly formatting the new command string. It is supposed to use the format specified in the settings to construct the new command.

The potential error location is in the line where the `editor_call` is being formatted. It seems that the `m.group('col')` is missing and causing the incorrect behavior.

To fix the bug, the function should properly handle the case when the column (`col`) information is available in the `m` object. If the column is available, it should be included in the `editor_call`.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import os

def _search(stderr):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    if 'col' in m.groupdict():
        editor_call = '{} {} +{}:{} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                         m.group('file'),
                                         m.group('line'),
                                         m.group('col'),
                                         command.script)
    else:
        editor_call = '{} {} +{} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                         m.group('file'),
                                         m.group('line'),
                                         command.script)

    return editor_call
```

This corrected code checks if the column information is available in the `m` object. If it is, it adds the column information to the `editor_call` string. Otherwise, it constructs the `editor_call` without the column information.
