The error occurs in the function `get_new_command` within the if-else statement. The error is related to formatting the string to return based on `test[3]` condition. 

The bug occurs because the colon is expected to be included in the string only when `test[3]` is true, but the current implementation includes the colon and additional formatting placeholders (`{}`) in both conditions. 

To fix the bug, we can ensure that the `:` is included only when `test[3]` is true. We can use conditional statements to build the string only if `test[3]` is true.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)
    
    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'], m.group('file'), m.group('line'))
    
    if test[3]:
        return shells.and_('{}:{} && {}'.format(editor_call, m.group('col'), command.script))
    else:
        return shells.and_('{} && {}'.format(editor_call, command.script))
```
