Potential error location: The error is likely coming from the `shells.and_` function, which is not a built-in Python function.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The `shells.and_` function is not a standard Python function, so it is likely a custom function defined elsewhere in the codebase. This means it could be a typo or an incorrect usage of a custom function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. If `shells.and_` is a custom function, make sure it is defined and imported properly in the code.
2. If `shells.and_` is supposed to be the built-in `and` operator, then it should be used without any modification.

Corrected code:

```python
import os

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                     m.group('file'),
                                     m.group('line'))
    return editor_call + " " + command.script
```
