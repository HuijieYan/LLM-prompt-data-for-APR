Potential error location: The error is likely occurring within the `get_new_command` function, where it is trying to access the `stderr` and `stdout` properties of the `command` object without checking if they exist.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The function is trying to access `stderr` and `stdout` properties of the `command` object without checking if they exist, causing a potential AttributeError.
2. The `os` module is used without being imported.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if `stderr` and `stdout` exist before trying to access them.
2. Import the `os` module if it's being used in the function.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_28/thefuck/rules/fix_file.py
import os  # Import the os module

# relative function's signature in this file
def _search(stderr):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# Corrected function
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    stderr = getattr(command, 'stderr', None)  # Check if stderr exists
    stdout = getattr(command, 'stdout', None)  # Check if stdout exists

    m = _search(stderr) or _search(stdout)

    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                     m.group('file'),
                                     m.group('line'))
    return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
```
