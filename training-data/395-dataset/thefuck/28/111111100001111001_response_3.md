The `_search` function is not defined in the provided code, so it's assumed to be defined elsewhere. The bug seems to be in the `get_new_command` function, specifically with the line `m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)` followed by the construction of `editor_call`.

The reason for the bug is that the _search function returns a match object, which is then used to construct `editor_call`. However, if `_search` returns None, attempting to access `m.group('file')` and `m.group('line')` will throw an AttributeError, resulting in a crash.

To fix this, you should check if `m` is not None before constructing the `editor_call`. If `m` is not None, you can construct the `editor_call` as intended. Otherwise, handle the situation where no match is found.

Here's the corrected `get_new_command` function:

```python
import os
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    stderr_match = _search(command.stderr)
    stdout_match = _search(command.stdout)
    
    if stderr_match:
        m = stderr_match
    elif stdout_match:
        m = stdout_match
    else:
        # Handle the case where no match is found
        return None  # Or any other appropriate action
    
    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'], m.group('file'), m.group('line'))
    return editor_call, command.script
```

This corrected code checks if `stderr_match` or `stdout_match` is found, and if either is found, it constructs the `editor_call` as intended. If neither is found, it can handle that case appropriately (such as returning None or taking another action).
