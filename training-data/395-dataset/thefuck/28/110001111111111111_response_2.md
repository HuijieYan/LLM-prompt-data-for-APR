The error seems to be occurring in the `get_new_command` function due to its incorrect handling of the `fixcolcmd`. The fixcolcmd should determine the presence of a fix_col_cmd$template in the fix_re.replace method, which should in turn result in setting the replacement's 'col' and 'col_end' groups in the corresponding editor_call line.

The potential error location within the code seems to be the line `settings = Settings({'fixcolcmd': '{editor} {file} +{line}:{col}'})` because it is not handling the `fixcolcmd` correctly.

The bug occurs because in the `get_new_command` method, the formatting of `editor_call` using the `fixcolcmd` from the `settings` variable is incorrect, which causes the assertion errors in the test function.

To fix the bug, the `fixcolcmd` should be correctly used to format the `editor_call` in the `get_new_command` method, allowing for proper handling of the line and column numbers when calling the editor.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` method:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    col_cmd_template = settings.fixcolcmd

    if m and 'col' in m.groupdict():
        col_cmd = col_cmd_template.format(
            file=m.group('file'),
            line=m.group('line'),
            col=m.group('col')
        )
    else:
        col_cmd = col_cmd_template.format(
            file=m.group('file'),
            line=m.group('line')
        )

    editor_call = '{} {} && {}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'], col_cmd, command.script)
    return editor_call
```

By using the `col_cmd_template` and checking for the presence of 'col' in the `m.groupdict()`, the code correctly handles the `fixcolcmd` and resolves the bug.
