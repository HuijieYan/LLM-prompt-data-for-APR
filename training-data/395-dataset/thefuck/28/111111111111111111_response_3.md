The error is occurring because the `get_new_command` function is not properly formatting the editor call when `test[3]` is not empty. It is not using the correct format for including the line and column information.

The bug is occurring because the logic for including line and column numbers in the editor call is not properly handling the case where there is no column number available.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for constructing the editor call to properly handle the cases where there is no column number available.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    editor_call = settings['fixcolcmd'].format(
        editor=os.environ['EDITOR'],
        file=m.group('file'),
        line=m.group('line'),
        col=m.group('col') if 'col' in m.groupdict() else ''
    )

    return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
```
