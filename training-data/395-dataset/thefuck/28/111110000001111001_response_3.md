The bug in the provided code is due to the use of the _search() function, which is not defined or implemented within the given code. Another issue is that the 'editor' environment variable is used without being imported from the os module.

To fix the bug, the _search() function needs to be implemented. Additionally, the 'os' module needs to be imported to use the 'EDITOR' environment variable.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import os
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = re.search(r'(?P<file>.*):(?P<line>\d+):(?P<col>\d+)', command.stderr) or re.search(r'(?P<file>.*):(?P<line>\d+):(?P<col>\d+)', command.stdout)

    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'], m.group('file'), m.group('line'))
    return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
```
