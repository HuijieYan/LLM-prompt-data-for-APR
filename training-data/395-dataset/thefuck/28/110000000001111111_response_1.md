The buggy function `get_new_command` has several issues:
1. There are references to undefined objects like `shells`, `_search`, and `os`.
2. The `editor_call` is being constructed using attributes such as `m.group('file')` and `m.group('line')` from the `m` object, but it's not clear how the `m` object is being generated.

To fix these issues:
1. Define the missing objects or import them if required.
2. Use proper error handling and validation to ensure that the `m` object is properly generated and contains the required groups before constructing the `editor_call`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import os
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    def _search(text):
        pattern = r'(?P<file>[^\n:]+):(?P<line>\d+):'
        return re.search(pattern, text)

    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    if m:
        editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'], m.group('file'), m.group('line'))
        return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
    else:
        return None
```

In this corrected version:
1. The `_search` function is defined within the `get_new_command` function to handle pattern matching.
2. The `m` object is properly validated before constructing the `editor_call` to handle cases where the search result might be None.

It's important to note that the use of objects such as `shells`, `_search`, and `os` depends on their actual implementation and usage in the larger context of the code. If these references are part of a larger codebase, their implementation and usage should be considered as well.
