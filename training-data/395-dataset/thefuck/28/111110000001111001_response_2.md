The bug in the `get_new_command` function is that it's referencing the `m` variable as if it were a `Match` object, but it doesn't check if `_search` function actually returns a match. This can lead to a `NoneType` error if `_search` doesn't find a match, as there is no guarantee that `m` will always be a valid `Match` object.

To fix this, we can check if `m` is not `None` before accessing its properties and building the `editor_call` string. If `m` is `None`, we can have a fallback behavior or raise an exception to handle the case where no match is found.

The corrected function would be:

```python
import os
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr)
    if m is None:
        m = _search(command.stdout)

    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    if m is not None:
        editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                         m.group('file'),
                                         m.group('line'))
        return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
    else:
        # handle case where no match is found
        return command.script  # or raise an exception
```

In this corrected code, we first check if `m` is `None` before using it to build the `editor_call` string. If `m` is indeed `None`, we can provide a fallback behavior or raise an exception.

This fix ensures that the code does not attempt to use `m` as a `Match` object when it is `None`, avoiding potential `NoneType` errors.
