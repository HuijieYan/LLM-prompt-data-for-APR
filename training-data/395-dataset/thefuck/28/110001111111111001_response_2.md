The error message indicates that there is an issue with the function `get_new_command` when constructing the `editor_call`. The error occurs due to the incorrect format of the `editor_call` when the regex match object is not found in the `stderr`.

Upon analyzing the code, it seems that there is an issue with the conditional check for `test[3]` and the subsequent formatting of the `editor_call`. When the match object is not found, the function should construct the `editor_call` without the `line:col` part.

The reason behind the bug is the incorrect conditional check for `test[3]` and the incorrect formatting of `editor_call` based on this condition.

To fix the bug, the conditional check for `test[3]` should be modified so that the `:col` part is only added when there is a valid `test[3]` present.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    # Note: Check for the presence of the match object and construct the editor_call accordingly
    if m:
        editor_call = '{} {} +{}:{} && {}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                                 m.group('file'),
                                                 m.group('line'),
                                                 m.group('col'))
    else:
        editor_call = '{} {} +{} && {}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                              m.group('file'),
                                              m.group('line'))

    return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
```

With this correction, the conditional check ensures that the `:col` part is only added to the `editor_call` when there is a valid match object.

This should fix the bug and ensure that the `editor_call` is constructed correctly in all cases.
