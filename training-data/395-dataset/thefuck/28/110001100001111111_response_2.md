The problem with the provided function is that the `_search` function is called with `command.stderr` and `command.stdout` without being defined. The `_search` function is expected to return a match object, which is used to extract the file and line number. However, the `_search` function is not defined, so it cannot return the expected match object.

To fix this issue, the `_search` function should be defined to search for the file and line number information in the input string. Additionally, the `os` module should be imported to use the `os.environ` function to access the `EDITOR` environment variable.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
import re
import os

def _search(text):
    patterns = [
        r'(?P<file>[\w\.]+):(?P<line>\d+):\d+:'
    ]
    
    for pattern in patterns:
        m = re.search(pattern, text)
        if m:
            return m
    return None

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)
    
    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'], m.group('file'), m.group('line'))
    return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
```

In the corrected code, the `_search` function is defined to search for the file and line number information using regular expressions. If a match is found, the function returns the match object; otherwise, it returns None. The `os` module is imported to access the `EDITOR` environment variable to construct the `editor_call` string.

This corrected code addresses the issues with the original function and ensures that the `_search` function is defined and used to extract the file and line number information from the input string.
