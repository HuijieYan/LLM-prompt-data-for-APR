Potential Error Location:
The bug is likely in the formatting of the editor_call variable. The placeholder for column information is missing from the format string, and the formatting is based on the environment variable 'EDITOR', which may not be defined.

Reasons Behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because the format string for the editor call is missing the column information, and it relies on the 'EDITOR' environment variable, which may not be defined in all cases.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the 'EDITOR' environment variable is defined and provide a default value if it is not.
2. Include the placeholder for the column information in the format string for the editor call.
3. Ensure that the 'EDITOR' environment variable is set to a valid editor command.

Corrected Code:

```python
import os

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor = os.environ.get('EDITOR', 'vim')  # Use 'vim' as default if 'EDITOR' is not defined
    editor_call = '{} {} +{}:{}'.format(editor, m.group('file'), m.group('line'), m.group('col'))
    # Also, consider providing a default value for 'col' in case it's not available in the match object
    return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
```
