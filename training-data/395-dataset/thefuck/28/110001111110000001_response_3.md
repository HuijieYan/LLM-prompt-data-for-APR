The provided Python function `get_new_command` seems to have issues with string formatting and is causing the test cases to fail. It appears that the issue lies in the string formatting with the '{}' placeholders. The 'and_' function might not be handling the two formatting expressions properly. 

The error message indicates that the formatting of the new command is not as expected. The assert statements fail because the actual value does not match the expected value.

The reason behind the bug could be incorrect string formatting with '{}' placeholders in the 'editor_call' variable and its usage in the 'shells.and_' function.

To fix this bug, the correct string formatting approach should be used. The correct way is to define the editor_call correctly and then use it in shells.and_ without reformatting.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` method:

```python
# relative function's signature in this file
def _search(stderr):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# this is the corrected function
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor_call = f"{os.environ['EDITOR']} {m.group('file')} +{m.group('line')}:{m.group('col')}"

    if m.group('col'):
        return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
    else:
        return shells.and_(f"{os.environ['EDITOR']} {m.group('file')} +{m.group('line')}", command.script)
```

This corrected code uses f-strings for string formatting and properly constructs the `editor_call` variable based on the conditions. This should resolve the formatting issues and make the function work as intended.
