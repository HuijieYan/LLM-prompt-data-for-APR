Potential error location: The error occurs when trying to access the `command.stderr` and `command.stdout` properties without verifying if they exist.

Reason for the bug: The code is assuming that `command` has `stderr` and `stdout` properties without checking for their existence.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Check if `command` has `stderr` and `stdout` properties before accessing them.

Corrected code:

```python
import os

def _search(stderr):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    stderr = getattr(command, 'stderr', None)
    stdout = getattr(command, 'stdout', None)
    
    m = _search(stderr) or _search(stdout)
    
    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    if m:
        editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                         m.group('file'),
                                         m.group('line'))
        return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
    else:
        return command.script
```
