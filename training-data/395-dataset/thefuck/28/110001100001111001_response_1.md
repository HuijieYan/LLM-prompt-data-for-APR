The provided code seems to have a logical error. The function `get_new_command` is attempting to call the `_search` function and use the result to construct the `editor_call`. However, the `_search` function is not properly defined within the function, which is likely causing the function to fail.

It seems that the `_search` function should be defined as a separate function, and its result should be passed as an argument to the `get_new_command` function.

To fix this bug, the `_search` function should be defined outside of the `get_new_command` function and then called appropriately within `get_new_command`. The `m.group` attribute also indicates that `_search` is actually a regex search, so the correct usage would involve pattern matching with regular expressions.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re
import os

# Define _search function
def _search(stderr):
    # ... omitted code ...
    return re.search(r'(?P<file>[\w\.]+):(?P<line>\d+):', stderr)

# Define corrected get_new_command function
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                     m.group('file'),
                                     m.group('line'))
    return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
```

In the corrected code, the `_search` function is defined outside the `get_new_command` function. The `re.search` function is used to search for a specific pattern within the `stderr` or `stdout` of the command, which is then used to construct the `editor_call`.
