The `get_new_command` function is being used by the test function `test_get_new_command_with_settings` to compare the expected output with the actual output. The expected output is being generated using the format string `'dummy_editor {} +{}:{} && {}'`. The placeholders `{}` within the format string represent the variables `test[1]`, `test[2]`, `test[3]`, and `test[0]`.

The error message indicates that the placeholders within the format string are not correctly aligned with the values being provided for the variables. For example, in one case, the expected value is `'dummy_editor ...+3 && gcc a.c'` while the actual value is `'dummy_editor ...:1 && gcc a.c'`. This mismatch suggests that the placeholders are causing the issue.

The bug is occurring because the placeholders in the format string are not aligned with the actual values being passed to the format function.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the placeholders within the format string are correctly aligned with the variables being used for formatting. 

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor_call = '{} {} +{}:{} && {}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                     m.group('file'),
                                     m.group('line'),
                                     m.group('col') if m.group('col') else '',
                                     command.script)
    return editor_call
```
