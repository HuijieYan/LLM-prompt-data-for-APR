The buggy function `get_new_command` takes in a `command` and `settings` as input parameters and attempts to extract file and line information from the `stderr` of the command. It then constructs an editor call using this extracted information. The bug occurs in the construction of the `editor_call` string.

The issue is caused by the incorrect format of the `editor_call` string, which is created using the `os.environ['EDITOR']` environment variable along with the file and line information. The placeholders for the file and line information are not correctly formatted.

To fix this bug, we need to correctly format the editor_call string using the file and line information extracted from the stderr of the command.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import os
import re

def _search(stderr):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    # Constructing editor call with correct format for file and line
    editor_call = '{} {}:{} {}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                       m.group('file'),
                                       m.group('line'),
                                       command.script)
    return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
```

In the corrected code, we use the format `{file}:{line}` to correctly construct the `editor_call` string. This will ensure that the file and line information are correctly formatted when constructing the editor call.
