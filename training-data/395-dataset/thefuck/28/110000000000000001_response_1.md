Potential error location: The potential error location is in the editor_call variable assignment, where it is trying to access the 'file' and 'line' attributes of the match object 'm' without checking if the match was successful.

Reason behind the bug: The bug occurs because the code is assuming that the match object 'm' will always be successful, without performing a check to see if it actually found a match.

Approach for fixing the bug: The code needs to check if the match was successful before accessing the 'file' and 'line' attributes of the match object.

Corrected code:
```python
import os
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    stderr_match = _search(command.stderr)
    stdout_match = _search(command.stdout)
    
    if stderr_match:
        editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                         stderr_match.group('file'),
                                         stderr_match.group('line'))
    elif stdout_match:
        editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                         stdout_match.group('file'),
                                         stdout_match.group('line'))
    else:
        editor_call = ''

    return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
```
