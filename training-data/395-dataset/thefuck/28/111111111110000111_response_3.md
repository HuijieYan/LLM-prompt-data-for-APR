Potential error location: The error seems to be occurring in the `get_new_command` function where the `editor_call` variable is being formatted. The format string for `editor_call` does not include the `col` attribute as part of the string interpolation, causing the error.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the `col` attribute is not being included in the `editor_call` format string, resulting in a mismatch between the expected and actual output.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, the `col` attribute needs to be included in the `editor_call` format string to ensure that it aligns with the test cases and expected output.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_28/thefuck/rules/fix_file.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def _search(stderr):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# corrected get_new_command function
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor_call = '{} {} +{}:{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'], m.group('file'), m.group('line'), m.group('col'))
    return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
```
