The problematic function is `get_new_command` which takes a `Command` object and settings as input and returns an editor call as output. The function uses the `_search` function to search for a pattern within the stderr or stdout of the command object, and based on the match, it constructs an editor call.

The bug occurs because the `_search` function is returning a match object, but the `get_new_command` function is not handling the case when `_search` returns `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when `_search` returns None and provide a default value for `m`. This can be achieved using an if-else condition or by using the `group` method directly on the result of `_search`, checking if it is not None.

Below is the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import os

# ... omitted code ...

# relative function's signature in this file
def _search(stderr):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# this is the fixed function
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    if m:
        editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'], m.group('file'), m.group('line'))
        return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
    else:
        # handle the case when _search returns None
        return command.script
```

In the corrected function, we first check if the result of `_search` is not None, and if it is not, we construct the `editor_call`. Otherwise, we return the original `command.script`.

This ensures that the function handles the case when `_search` doesn't find a match and prevents the bug from occurring.
