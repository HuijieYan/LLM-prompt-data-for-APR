The buggy function get_new_command() is designed to search for error messages in the stderr and stdout of a command and then construct a command to open the file and line where the error occurred in an editor for the user to fix.

The potential error in the function lies in how the editor_call is being constructed. It uses a format string with placeholders for the environment variable EDITOR, file, and line. However, the placeholders for col (column) are not handled in the format string.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to handle the col parameter in the format string for editor_call.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import os

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor_call = '{} {} +{}:{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                        m.group('file'),
                                        m.group('line'),
                                        m.group('col'))
    return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
```

In the corrected code, the format string for editor_call has been modified to include placeholders for the col parameter. Now, when constructing the editor call, both line and col parameters will be included as expected.
