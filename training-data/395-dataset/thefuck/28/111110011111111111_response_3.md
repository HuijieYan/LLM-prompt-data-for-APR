The bug in the provided function seems to be related to the construction of the `editor_call` variable. In the failing test cases, the `fixcolcmd` format string was not applied correctly, leading to the incorrect `editor_call`.

The function `get_new_command` should construct the `editor_call` based on the provided `fixcolcmd` and other relevant attributes. It seems that the `fixcolcmd` is not being utilized correctly to construct the `editor_call`.

To fix this issue, the `get_new_command` function needs to correctly use the `fixcolcmd` format string to construct the `editor_call`. Additionally, it should handle cases where `col` might not be available or might be an empty string.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import os
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = re.search(r'^.*?(\d+):(\d+).*$', command.stderr)
    if not m:
        m = re.search(r'^.*?(\d+).*$', command.stderr)
    
    file = command.script.split(' ')[-1]
    line = m.group(1)
    col = m.group(2) if len(m.groups()) > 1 else ''

    editor_call = settings.fixcolcmd.format(editor=os.environ['EDITOR'], file=file, line=line, col=col)
    return f'{editor_call} && {command.script}'
```

In this corrected version, the function first attempts to extract line and column information from the command's error output based on a specific pattern. If the column information is not available, it defaults to an empty string.

Then, it constructs the `editor_call` using the `fixcolcmd` format string from the settings. Finally, it returns the combined command with the editor call.

This change should address the issues identified in the failing test cases and provide the expected behavior based on the provided test inputs.
