Potential error location: The buggy code is likely in the line where the `editor_call` is being constructed using a format string.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The code is trying to construct the `editor_call` using `m.group('file')` and `m.group('line')`, but it's missing the import of the `os` module. Additionally, the `shells.and_` method is not a valid method.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Import the `os` module, and use the `subprocess` module for generating the `editor_call`. Also, construct the new command using string concatenation rather than using the `shells.and_` method.

Corrected code:

```python
import os

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)
    
    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                     m.group('file'),
                                     m.group('line'))
    new_command = editor_call + " " + command.script
    return new_command
```
