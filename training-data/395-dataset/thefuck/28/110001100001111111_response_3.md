The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to extract information from the `stderr` and `stdout` of the `command` and create an editor call. However, the function is not properly extracting the required information and creating the editor call in the `editor_call` variable.

The bug occurs because the `_search` function is not properly extracting the required information from the `stderr` and `stdout` of the `command`. This results in the `m` variable not having the correct information, which leads to an incorrect `editor_call` being generated.

To fix the bug, the `_search` function should be modified to correctly extract the file, line, and column information from the `stderr` and `stdout` of the `command`. Additionally, the `get_new_command` function should be updated to handle cases where `_search` returns `None` for both `stderr` and `stdout`.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_new_command` and `_search` functions:

```python
import os
import re

def _search(output):
    match = re.search(r'(?P<file>\w+\.\w+):(?P<line>\d+):(?P<col>\d+)', output)
    return match

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)
    
    if m:
        editor_call = '{} {} +{}:{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'], m.group('file'), m.group('line'), m.group('col'))
        return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
    else:
        # Handle cases where no matches are found
        return None
```

In this corrected code, the `_search` function properly extracts the file, line, and column information using regular expressions. The `get_new_command` function also checks if a match is found and constructs the `editor_call` accordingly. If no matches are found, it can handle those cases appropriately, for example by returning `None`.
