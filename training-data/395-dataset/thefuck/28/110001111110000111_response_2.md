The function `get_new_command` has multiple bugs. It is attempting to use regular expressions to search for file paths and lines, but it does not include any code to import the `re` module. Additionally, there is a mismatch in the format string when constructing the `editor_call`. Finally, the logic implicit in the name `get_new_command` is unclear, making it difficult to judge if the buggy function meets the test specifications.

The bugs occur because of the missing `re` module and the incorrect format string when constructing `editor_call`.

One approach to fix the bugs is to import the `re` module to support the regular expression usage and modify the format string appropriately.

Corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import os
import re

def _search(stderr):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor_call = '{} {} +{}{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                      m.group('file'),
                                      m.group('line'),
                                      ':' + m.group('col') if m.group('col') else '')
    return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
```
