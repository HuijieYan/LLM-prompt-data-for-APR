The potential error in the provided function is in the `get_new_command` function. It attempts to access the `stderr` attribute directly from the `command` object without correctly passing `command` as a parameter to the `_search` function.

The bug occurs because the `get_new_command` function is trying to access the `stderr` attribute of the `command` object directly, but it should call the `_search` function passing the `command` object as a parameter.

To fix the bug, the `_search` function should accept the `stderr` as a parameter and be called with the `stderr` value from the `command` object.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import os

def _search(stderr):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                     m.group('file'),
                                     m.group('line'))
    return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
```
