Potential error location: 
The error is likely occurring in the `get_new_command` function where the `editor_call` variable is being created.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug seems to be related to the incorrect formatting of the `editor_call` string, specifically with the addition of the column `{col}` when it might not be present in the `fixcolcmd` settings.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the `col` exists in the settings. If it does, incorporate it into the `editor_call` string. If it doesn't, handle the formatting accordingly.
2. Ensure that the placeholders are being replaced correctly and in the intended format.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import os

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor = os.environ['EDITOR']
    file = m.group('file')
    line = m.group('line')
    col = m.group('col')

    if col and '{col}' in settings['fixcolcmd']:
        editor_call = '{} {} +{}:{}'.format(editor, file, line, col)
    else:
        editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(editor, file, line)

    return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
```
