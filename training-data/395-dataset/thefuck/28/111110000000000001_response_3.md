Potential error location: The error in this function seems to be caused by the use of the `shells.and_` function. This function does not seem to be recognized, and it should likely be replaced with something else, such as the `subprocess` module for executing the shell command.

Reasons behind the bug: The `shells.and_` function is not a recognized function in Python, and likely was meant to be `subprocess` to execute the shell command. 

Approach for fixing the bug: Replace the `shells.and_` function with the `subprocess` module for executing the shell command.

Corrected code:
```python
import subprocess

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                     m.group('file'),
                                     m.group('line'))
    subprocess.call(editor_call, shell=True)
    return command.script
```
