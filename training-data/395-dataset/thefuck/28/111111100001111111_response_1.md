Buggy function `_get_new_command` has the following issues:

1. The `_search` function is not correctly indented within `_get_new_command`
2. It is missing the import statement for `os`
3. The function returns `shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)` which does not match the expected return type

The potential error occurs because the `_search` function is not aligned properly and the required import statement is missing. The return statement also does not match the expected return type.

To fix the bug:
1. Correct the indentation of the `_search` function to be at the same level as the `_get_new_command` function.
2. Add the import statement for `os` at the beginning of the file.
3. Update the return statement to match the expected return type.

The corrected code for the problematic function is:

```python
import os
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_28/thefuck/rules/fix_file.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def _search(stderr):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# this is the corrected function
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                     m.group('file'),
                                     m.group('line'))
    return editor_call + ' ' + command.script
```

This code aligns the `_search` function correctly, adds the required import statement for `os`, and updates the return statement to match the expected return type.
