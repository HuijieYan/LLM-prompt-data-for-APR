The error message is indicating a problem with the format of the command generated by the `get_new_command` function. It seems that the `col` variable is not being handled correctly and is causing an assertion error in the test cases.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the formatting of the `editor_call` variable which incorporates the `col` value.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `col` value is not being handled properly in the `editor_call` formatting.

To fix the bug, the `col` value should be included in the `editor_call` formation if it exists, and a conditional check should be added to handle this scenario. This can be achieved using an if-else statement to modify the `editor_call` string based on the presence of the `col` value.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
import os

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    file = m.group('file')
    line = m.group('line')
    
    editor = os.environ['EDITOR']
    if 'col' in m.groupdict():
        editor_call = '{} {} +{}:{} {}'.format(editor, file, line, m.group('col'), command.script)
    else:
        editor_call = '{} {} +{} {}'.format(editor, file, line, command.script)
    return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
```
