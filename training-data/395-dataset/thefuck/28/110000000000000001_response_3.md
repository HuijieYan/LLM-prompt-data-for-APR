Potential error location: The use of `shells.and_` which is not a standard Python function.

Reason for the bug: The `shells.and_` function does not exist in Python, so this function call will raise a NameError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Remove the incorrect `shells.and_` function and use the correct syntax for concatenating strings.

Corrected code:
```python
import os

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just ignored for now
    editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'], m.group('file'), m.group('line'))
    return editor_call + " " + command.script
```
