Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the `get_new_command` function where the `command` parameter is used to access `stderr` and `stdout` attributes, but it seems that `command` does not have these attributes.

Reason for the bug: The function is trying to access `stderr` and `stdout` attributes from the `command` parameter, but it seems that `command` is not an object with these attributes.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Modify the function signature to include `stderr` and `stdout` as parameters.
2. Check if the `command` parameter has `stderr` and `stdout` attributes before using them.

Corrected code:
```python
import os

def _search(stderr):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def get_new_command(command, stderr, stdout, settings):
    m = _search(stderr) or _search(stdout)
    
    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                     m.group('file'),
                                     m.group('line'))
    return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
```
