The error is likely occurring in the `get_new_command` function. The error message indicates that there is an issue with formatting the expected output, specifically with the addition of `+{line}:{col}` when `test[3]` is true.

The potential error in the code is likely due to the incorrect formatting of the `editor_call` variable. If `test[3]` is true, the format should include the column number as well. However, the current implementation does not handle this case correctly, leading to the incorrect output and assertion failure in the test cases.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `get_new_command` function to correctly handle the case when `test[3]` is true and include the column number in the `editor_call` if available.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    # Note: There does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'], m.group('file'), m.group('line'))
  
    if test[3]:  # Include column number if available
        editor_call += ':{0}'.format(m.group('col'))

    return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
```

This corrected code checks if `test[3]` is true and adds the column number to the `editor_call` if available. This should fix the bug and match the expected output in the test cases.
