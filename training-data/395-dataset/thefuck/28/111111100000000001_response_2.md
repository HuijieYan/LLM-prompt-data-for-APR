Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the use of the `_search` function within the `get_new_command` function.

Reason for the bug:
The `_search` function is being called with the `stderr` and `stdout` attributes of the `command` object, but the `_search` function does not take any arguments. This is likely to cause an error.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
Pass the `stderr` and `stdout` attributes of the `command` object to the `_search` function as arguments.

Corrected code:

```python
import os

def _search(data):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)
    
    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                     m.group('file'),
                                     m.group('line'))
    return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
```
