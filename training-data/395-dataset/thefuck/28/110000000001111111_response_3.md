The bug in the `get_new_command` function is that it attempts to use the `_search` method without first importing it. Additionally, the `shells.and_` method is used without it being defined as well.

To fix the bug, the `_search` method needs to be imported, and the correct method for combining shell commands needs to be used.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import os
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = re.search(r'(?P<file>\w+\.\w+):(?P<line>\d+)', command.stderr) or re.search(r'(?P<file>\w+\.\w+):(?P<line>\d+)', command.stdout)

    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor_call = '{} {} +{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'], m.group('file'), m.group('line'))
    return editor_call + ' ' + command.script
```
