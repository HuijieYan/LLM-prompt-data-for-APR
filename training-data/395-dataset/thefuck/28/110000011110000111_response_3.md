The test case is failing due to a mismatch in the output of the `get_new_command` function with the expected output. The function is expected to construct a command based on the provided parameters, but it is failing to do so in the current implementation.

Upon analyzing the bug and the test case, it seems that the bug is in the construction of the `editor_call` string within the `get_new_command` function. The issue lies in the format of the string used to construct `editor_call`.

The reason for the bug is that the format for `editor_call` is incorrect, resulting in the wrong output. It seems that the placeholder for `{line}` and `{col}` in the `editor_call` format string is not being handled correctly.

To fix the bug, the placeholders `{line}` and `{col}` should be formatted properly to ensure that the `editor_call` is constructed correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import os

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    m = _search(command.stderr) or _search(command.stdout)

    # Note: there does not seem to be a standard for columns, so they are just
    # ignored for now
    editor_call = '{} {} +{}:{}'.format(os.environ['EDITOR'],
                                     m.group('file'),
                                     m.group('line'), m.group('col'))
    return shells.and_(editor_call, command.script)
```

In this corrected code, the placeholders `{line}` and `{col}` are formatted using `m.group('line')` and `m.group('col')` respectively to ensure that they are included correctly in the `editor_call` string.
