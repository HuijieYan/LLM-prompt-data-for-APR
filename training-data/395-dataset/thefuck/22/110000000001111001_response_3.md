The potential error in the given function is that it tries to access the `self._cached` list even though it is empty. This can lead to an `IndexError` when trying to access the first element of an empty list in the line `self._cached[0]`.

To fix this, we need to handle the case when `self._cached` is empty before trying to access its first element.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    
    if self._cached:  # Check if self._cached is not empty
        self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    else:
        self._cached = sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```

In the corrected code, before trying to access the first element of `self._cached`, we check if it's empty or not. If it's empty, we simply assign the sorted `commands` to `self._cached`. Otherwise, we prepend the first element of `self._cached` to the sorted `commands`.
