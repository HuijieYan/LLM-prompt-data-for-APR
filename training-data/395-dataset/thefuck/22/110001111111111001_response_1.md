The error message indicates that an "IndexError" occurred at line 85 in the function "_realise" in the file types.py. The error is caused by accessing the first element of the empty list "self._cached" on this line: `self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)`.

The bug in this code is that it tries to access the first element of an empty list "self._cached", resulting in an "IndexError" since there are no elements in the list to access.

To fix this bug, we need to check if "self._cached" is empty before trying to access its first element.

Here is the corrected code for the function "_realise":

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    if self._cached:
        commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
        self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
        self._realised = True
    else:
        self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```

In the corrected code, we added a check for whether "self._cached" is empty before accessing its first element. If it's empty, we just set "self._realised" to "True" and skip the rest of the code. This prevents the "IndexError" from occurring.
