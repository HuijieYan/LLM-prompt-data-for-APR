The error message indicates an 'IndexError' at line 85 in the '_realise' method of the 'SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence' class. Specifically, the error occurs at the line 'self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)', which suggests that the index [0] is out of range for the '_cached' list.

The bug occurs because the '_cached' list is being accessed using index [0] without being initialized. This leads to the 'IndexError' when trying to access the first element of an empty list.

To fix the bug, we should first check if the '_cached' list is empty before trying to access its first element. If it is empty, we need to handle this case appropriately, ensuring that the index [0] is within the bounds of the list.

The corrected code for the '_realise' method is as follows:

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    if len(self._cached) > 0:  # Check if the _cached list is not empty
        self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    else:
        self._cached = sorted(commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)  # Initialize _cached list
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
