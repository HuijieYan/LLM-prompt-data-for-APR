The error message indicates an "IndexError: list index out of range" at line 85 of the thefuck/types.py file. This suggests that the issue is related to accessing an index that is out of range within the _cached list.

Looking at the _realise method, it seems that the error is likely occurring when trying to access self._cached[0] to create a new list. However, it is not clear why this is causing an index out of range error.

One possible reason could be that self._cached is an empty list, and accessing self._cached[0] is causing the index out of range error. Another reason could be that self._cached is not initialized properly, causing it to have a length of 0.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that self._cached is properly initialized before trying to access its elements.

Here is the corrected code for the _realise method:

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    if self._cached:
        self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    else:
        self._cached = sorted(commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```

In the corrected code, we first check if self._cached is not empty before trying to access its elements. If it's not empty, we proceed with the original operation. Otherwise, we assign the sorted commands directly to self._cached. This ensures that the index out of range error is avoided.
