The error message indicates that an IndexError occurred at line 85 of the `thefuck/types.py` file. This is happening when trying to access `self._cached[0]` which suggests that `self._cached` is an empty list.

Based on the test function and the error message, the potential error location within the function is when trying to access `self._cached[0]` in the line `self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(...)`. This is likely to happen because `self._cached` is initially an empty list, and it tries to access its first index.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that when the function `_realise` is called and the `self._cached` is initialized as an empty list, it tries to access its first index without any check for emptiness.

A possible approach to fix the bug is to add a check to ensure that `self._cached` is not empty before accessing its first index. This can be achieved by checking the length of `self._cached` before accessing its first index.

Here's the corrected code for the `_realise` function:

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    if self._cached:  # Check if self._cached is not empty
        self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    else:
        self._cached = sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
