The error message indicates that there is an IndexError in the _realise method of the SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence class. Specifically, the error occurs when trying to access the index 0 of an empty list self._cached.

The potential error location is within the line:
```python
self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
    commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
```
This line is trying to access the first element of self._cached, but since self._cached is empty, it causes an IndexError.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code is trying to access the first element of self._cached, assuming that it exists, without considering the possibility that it might be empty.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if self._cached is empty, and if it is, handle it appropriately. One approach is to only append to self._cached if it's not empty. We should also handle the case when it is empty by directly assigning the sorted commands to self._cached.

Here's the corrected code for the _realise method:

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    if self._cached:  # If self._cached is not empty
        self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    else:  # If self._cached is empty
        self._cached = sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
This corrected code first checks if self._cached is not empty. If it is, it appends the sorted commands to it. If it is empty, it simply assigns the sorted commands to it.
