The error message indicates an "IndexError" in the `_realise` method of the `SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence` class in the file `types.py`. The error occurs when trying to access an index of the `_cached` list that is out of range. This suggests that the `_cached` list is empty when it is being accessed, causing the index out of range error.

Upon analyzing the code, it appears that the `_cached` list is being accessed before it is initialized and populated with any values.

To fix this bug, we need to make sure that the `_cached` list is properly initialized before trying to access its elements.

Here's the corrected code for the `_realise` method:

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    if len(self._cached) == 0:
        # Initialize _cached with the first element from commands
        self._cached = [commands[0]]
    self._cached += sorted(commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
