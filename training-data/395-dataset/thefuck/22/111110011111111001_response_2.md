The error message indicates an 'IndexError' occurred in the '_realise' function of the 'SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence' class. Specifically, the error is caused by 'self._cached[0]' which leads to a 'list index out of range' error.

The potential error location is identified in the line:
```python
self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is trying to access the first element of 'self._cached', which is an empty list in the test case (Blank value). This results in an 'IndexError' because there are no elements in the list to access.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to first check if 'self._cached' is not empty before accessing its first element. If the list is not empty, then concatenate the sorted 'commands' list with 'self._cached[0]', otherwise just set 'self._cached' equal to the sorted 'commands' list.

Here's the corrected code for the '_realise' function:

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    
    if self._cached:  # Check if self._cached is not empty
        self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    else:
        self._cached = sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
