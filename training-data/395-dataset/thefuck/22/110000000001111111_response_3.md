The potential error in the given function is that it is trying to access the 0th element of `self._cached` without checking if it exists or not. This can lead to an "IndexError" if `self._cached` is empty.

The reason behind this bug is that the function is assuming that `self._cached` has at least one element, but it is not properly handling the case when it is empty.

To fix this bug, we will need to check if `self._cached` is empty and handle that case before trying to access its 0th element.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    
    if self._cached:  # Check if self._cached is not empty
        self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    else:
        self._cached = sorted(commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)

    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```

This corrected code first checks if `self._cached` is not empty before trying to access its 0th element. If it is empty, it directly assigns the sorted `commands` to `self._cached`.
