Potential Error: 
The potential error in the provided function is that it tries to access the 'priority' attribute of the 'corrected_command' object, but the 'corrected_command' object is not defined anywhere in the function.

Reason for the Bug:
The error occurs because the variable 'corrected_command' is not defined for the lambda function used to sort the commands.

Approach to Fix the Bug:
To fix the bug, the lambda function should be modified to access the 'priority' attribute of the 'Command' objects directly, without using the 'corrected_command' variable.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
        commands, key=lambda command: command.priority)  # Accessing 'priority' attribute directly
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
