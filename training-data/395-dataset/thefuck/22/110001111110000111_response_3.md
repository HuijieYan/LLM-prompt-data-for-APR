The error message indicates an "IndexError" in the "_realise" function of the "SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence" class in the "thefuck/types.py" file. The error occurs when trying to access "self._cached[0]" and suggests that the list index is out of range.

Upon analyzing the code, it seems that the issue might be related to how the "_cached" attribute is being accessed and manipulated within the "_realise" function.

The potential error location is at this line:
```python
self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
    commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
```

The error occurs because the "_cached" list is being indexed to access its first element (self._cached[0]), but it seems there is no guarantee that "_cached" is not empty. This issue likely causes the "IndexError: list index out of range" because an empty list does not have a 0 index.

To fix this bug, you can add a check to ensure that the "_cached" list is not empty before accessing its first element. 

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    if self._cached:
        self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    else:
        self._cached = sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
