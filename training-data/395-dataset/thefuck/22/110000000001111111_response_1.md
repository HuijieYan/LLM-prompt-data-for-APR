The potential error in the provided function is with the line:
```python
commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
```
This line is trying to call a method `_remove_duplicates` on the object `self`, but it seems that this method is not defined in the class.

The bug occurred because the `_remove_duplicates` method is not defined for the class `SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence`, leading to a `NameError` when the function is called.

To fix this bug, the `_remove_duplicates` method needs to be defined for the class `SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence`.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = list(set(self._commands))  # removing duplicates
    self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
        commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
