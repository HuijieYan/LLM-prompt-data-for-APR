Potential error location:
The error in the code seems to be in the `_realise` method, specifically in the line `self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(...)`. 

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The issue seems to be that `self._cached[0]` is being used without being initialized, which could lead to a `IndexError` since it's accessing the first element of the `self._cached` list.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
One approach to fix this bug is to initialize `self._cached` as an empty list before using it in the `_realise` method. Additionally, we need to ensure that `self._commands` and `corrected_command.priority` are accessible within the `_realise` method.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _realise(self):
        """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
        commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
        self._cached = []  # Initialize _cached as an empty list
        if self._commands:
            self._cached = [self._commands[0]] + sorted(
                commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
        self._realised = True
        debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
            self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
