The error occurred in the `_realise` method of the `SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence` class. The test case `test_with_blank` creates an instance of `SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence` with an empty iterator and then attempts to convert it to a list, which triggers the `_realise` method. The error is caused by trying to access the first element of the empty list `self._cached`. This is clear from the error message: `IndexError: list index out of range`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `_cached` is not empty before trying to access its first element. We can add a check to see if it's empty, and if so, avoid attempting to access it.

Here's the corrected code for the `_realise` method:

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    if self._cached:  # Check if _cached is not empty
        self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    else:
        self._cached = sorted(commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack()), self._settings))
```

With this modification, the `_realise` method now checks if `_cached` is not empty before trying to access its first element. If it's empty, it simply assigns the sorted `commands` to `_cached`.
