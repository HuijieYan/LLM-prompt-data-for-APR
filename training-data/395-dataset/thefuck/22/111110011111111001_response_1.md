The error occurs in the `_realise` method of the `SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence` class. The line `self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)` is causing an `IndexError: list index out of range`.

This error is likely occurring because `self._cached` is an empty list ([]), and when trying to access `self._cached[0]`, it is causing an index out of range error.

To fix this issue, we can modify the code to check if `self._cached` is empty before accessing its first element.

Here's the corrected code for the `SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence` class with the `_realise` function fixed:

```python
class SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence(object):
    """
    List-like collection/wrapper around generator, that:
    
    - immediately gives access to the first commands through [];
    - realises generator and sorts commands on first access to other
      commands through [], or when len called.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def _remove_duplicates(self, corrected_commands):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def _realise(self):
        """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
        commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
        if not self._cached:  # Check if _cached is empty
            self._cached = [commands[0]] + sorted(
                commands[1:], key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
        else:
            self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
                commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
        self._realised = True
        debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
            self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```

This fix checks if `self._cached` is empty before accessing its first element, and if it's empty, it directly adds the first element of the `commands` list.
