Potential Errors:
1. self._cached[0]: It seems like the intention here is to preserve the first item in the cached list, but the current implementation does not make sense as it is being overwritten by the sorted list of commands.
2. Sorting logic: The sorting logic using the lambda function might not be correct.

Reasons for the Bug:
1. Overwriting self._cached[0] with the result of sorting commands will lead to unexpected behavior.
2. The sorting logic using the lambda function may not be correctly implemented.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Preserve the first item in self._cached before sorting the commands.
2. Revise the sorting logic to ensure correct sorting based on command priority.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    
    # Preserve the first item in self._cached before sorting
    cached_first = self._cached[0]
    self._cached = [cached_first] + sorted(
        commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
