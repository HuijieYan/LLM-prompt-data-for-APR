The error message indicates an "IndexError" occurring at line 85 of the file "thefuck/types.py" within the "_realise" method. This error is caused by an attempt to access an index in a list that is out of range.

The potential error location within the problematic function is at the line:
```python
self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `_cached` list is being accessed with index [0] without checking if it has any elements. This is causing the "IndexError" when attempting to access the first element of an empty list.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to add a condition to check if the `_cached` list has any elements before accessing its first element.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _realise(self):
        """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
        commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
        if self._cached:  # Check if _cached has elements before accessing the first element
            self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
                commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
        else:
            self._cached = sorted(commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
        self._realised = True
```
