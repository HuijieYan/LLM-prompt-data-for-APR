The potential error in the provided function is with the `_remove_duplicates` method, as it is called within the `_realise` method without being defined correctly.

The reason for the bug is that the `_remove_duplicates` method is not defined within the `SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence` class, and it is unclear whether it should be an instance method or a class method.

To fix the bug, the `_remove_duplicates` method should be defined as a static method within the `SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence` class, and the method call within the `_realise` method should be updated to reflect this change.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence(object):
    """
    List-like collection/wrapper around generator, that:
    
    - immediately gives access to the first commands through [];
    - realises generator and sorts commands on first access to other
      commands through [], or when len called.
    """

    @staticmethod
    def _remove_duplicates(corrected_commands):
        # Implement the logic to remove duplicates
        return list(set(corrected_commands))

    def _realise(self):
        """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
        commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
        self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
        self._realised = True
        debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
            self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```

In the corrected code, I have defined the `_remove_duplicates` method as a static method within the `SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence` class. This allows it to be called without referring to `self`. The method then implements the logic to remove duplicates from the `corrected_commands` list.

The `_realise` method has been updated to call the `_remove_duplicates` method correctly.
