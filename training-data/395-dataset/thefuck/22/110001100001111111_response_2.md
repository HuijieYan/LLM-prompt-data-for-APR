The error is likely in the _remove_duplicates method or how it is being used in the _realise method. The _remove_duplicates method is likely not working correctly, causing the commands list to not be properly deduplicated.

Potential reasons for the bug:
1. The _remove_duplicates method may not be correctly removing duplicates from the list.
2. There might be an issue in how the _remove_duplicates method is being called or used within the _realise method.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the implementation of the _remove_duplicates method to ensure it correctly removes duplicates from the list of commands.
2. Verify that the _remove_duplicates method is being called and used correctly within the _realise method.

Here's the corrected code for the _realise method:

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = list(set(self._commands))  # Removes duplicates from the list of commands
    self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
        commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```

In the corrected code, the list of commands is converted to a set to remove duplicates, and then converted back to a list before being used in the sorting and assignment to self._cached. This ensures that the list of commands is deduplicated before further processing.
