The potential error in the provided function is likely in the line:
```python
self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
        commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
```
The bug seems to be caused by trying to access the first element of an empty list `self._cached` without checking if it is empty.

The bug occurred because the function is trying to access the first element of the `self._cached` list without checking if the list is empty. In the provided test case, the `self._cached` list is initially empty, and the code directly tries to access its first element which is not valid in this case.

To fix the bug, we need to check whether `self._cached` is empty before attempting to access its first element.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    if self._cached:  # check if self._cached is not empty
        self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    else:
        self._cached = sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
