The error is likely to occur in the _realise function, specifically in the line:
```python
commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
```
The function _remove_duplicates is called on self._commands, which is a list_iterator object. This is likely causing the bug.

The bug is caused because the function _remove_duplicates is expecting a list, but it is receiving a list_iterator instead.

To fix the bug, we need to convert the list_iterator to a list before passing it to the _remove_duplicates function.

The corrected code for the problematic function would be:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_22/thefuck/types.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def _remove_duplicates(self, corrected_commands):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# this is the corrected function
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(list(self._commands))  # Convert list_iterator to list
    self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
        commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
