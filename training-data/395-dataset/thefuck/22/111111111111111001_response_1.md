The error message "IndexError: list index out of range" suggests that the problematic line of code is trying to access an index of a list that does not exist, indicating that the list is empty. This is likely caused by the line `self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)`.

The potential error location is line `self._cached = [self._cached[0]]` because it tries to access the first element of an empty list `self._cached`.

The bug occurs because the code is trying to access the first element of an empty list `self._cached`, which does not exist. This is likely due to a misunderstanding of the initial state of `self._cached`.

To fix the bug, we can check if `self._cached` is empty before attempting to access its first element. If it is empty, we can assign an empty list to `self._cached` to prevent the error.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    if self._cached:
        self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    else:
        self._cached = sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
