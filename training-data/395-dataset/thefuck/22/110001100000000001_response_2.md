The potential error in the provided code is that the `_remove_duplicates` function is defined incorrectly. It is intended to be a method of a class, but it is not properly indented and does not have the `self` parameter.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `_remove_duplicates` function is not correctly defined as a method of the class, causing it to not be accessible within the `_realise` method.

To fix this bug, we need to properly define the `_remove_duplicates` function as a method of the class, with the `self` parameter.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_22/thefuck/types.py

class ClassName:  # replace ClassName with the actual class name
    # relative function's signature in this file
    def _remove_duplicates(self, corrected_commands):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def _realise(self):
        """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
        commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
        self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
        self._realised = True
        debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
            self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```

In the corrected code, the `_remove_duplicates` function is properly defined as a method of the class, and it has the `self` parameter to access the class attributes and methods.
