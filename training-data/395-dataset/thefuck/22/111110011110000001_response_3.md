The error message indicates an "IndexError" at the line `self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)`. This suggests that there is an issue with accessing an index that is out of range in the list `self._cached`.

The potential error location is at the line mentioned in the error message.

The bug is occurring because it is trying to access the first element of `self._cached` (`self._cached[0]`) without checking if it exists, leading to an "IndexError" when it is empty.

To fix the bug, we should first check if `self._cached` is empty. If it is, then there is no need to access its first element. We can directly assign the sorted `commands` to `self._cached`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_realise` method:

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    if self._cached:
        self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    else:
        self._cached = sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
