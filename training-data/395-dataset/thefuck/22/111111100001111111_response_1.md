The potential error location within the `_realise` function is the `_remove_duplicates(self._commands)` call. The error is likely caused by the `_commands` variable being a list iterator, which requires conversion to a list before being passed to `_remove_duplicates`.

To fix this bug, we need to convert the list iterator `self._commands` to a list before passing it to `_remove_duplicates`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(list(self._commands))  # Convert list iterator to list
    self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
        commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
