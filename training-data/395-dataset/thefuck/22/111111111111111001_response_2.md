The error message `IndexError: list index out of range` indicates that the buggy function `_realise` is trying to access an index of `self._cached` that does not exist. This could be due to `self._cached` being an empty list and trying to access its first element at index 0.

The potential error location within the `_realise` function is the line `self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(...)`. It is trying to access the first element of `self._cached[0]`, but since `self._cached` is initially empty, this will cause an `IndexError` because the list has no elements.

To fix this bug, we can check if `self._cached` is empty before trying to access its first element. If it is empty, we can set `self._cached` to the sorted `commands` directly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_realise` function:

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    if not self._cached:  # Check if self._cached is empty
        self._cached = sorted(self._remove_duplicates(self._commands), key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    else:
        commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
        self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```

In the corrected code, we first check if `self._cached` is empty. If it is, we directly set it to the sorted `commands`. Otherwise, we proceed with the original logic of the function.

This should resolve the `IndexError` caused by trying to access the first element of an empty list and ensure that the function works as intended.
