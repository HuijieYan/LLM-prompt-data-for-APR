The error message indicates that there is an "IndexError" occurring in the "_realise" method of the "SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence" class in the file "thefuck/types.py" at line 85.

Upon analyzing the buggy function, it seems that the error is occurring while trying to access the first element of the "_cached" list: "self._cached[0]". The error is caused by attempting to access an index which does not exist, resulting in an IndexError.

The reason behind this bug is that the "_cached" list might be empty, and thus, trying to access the first element results in an IndexError.

To fix this bug, we should check if the "_cached" list is empty before trying to access its first element. If it is empty, we can initialize it with an empty list.

Here's the corrected method:

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    
    if not self._cached:
        self._cached = []
    
    self._cached += sorted(
        commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```

By checking if the "_cached" list is empty before trying to access its first element, we prevent the IndexError from occurring.
