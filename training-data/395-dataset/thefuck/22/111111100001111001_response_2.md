The potential error location within the problematic function is the line where the `_remove_duplicates` method is called.

The bug is likely occurring because the `_remove_duplicates` method is defined with `self` as the first parameter, indicating that it's an instance method. However, it seems to be intended to be a static method since it is being called without an instance (`self`) within the `_realise` method.

To fix this bug, we can change the `_remove_duplicates` method to a static method or a class method, or we can call it on the class itself rather than on the instance.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected function source code
def _remove_duplicates(corrected_commands):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

class SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence(object):
    """
    List-like collection/wrapper around generator, that:
    
    - immediately gives access to the first commands through [];
    - realises generator and sorts commands on first access to other
      commands through [], or when len called.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    @staticmethod
    def _remove_duplicates(corrected_commands):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass



    def _realise(self):
        """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
        commands = SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
        self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
        self._realised = True
        debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
            self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```

In the corrected code, we changed the `_remove_duplicates` method to a static method using the `@staticmethod` decorator, and we call it on the class itself within the `_realise` method. This should resolve the issue and prevent the bug from occurring.
