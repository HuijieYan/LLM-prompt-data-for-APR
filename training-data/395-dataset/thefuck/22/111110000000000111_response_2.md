Potential error location: The potential error in the provided function is at the line `self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)`. 

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because `self._cached` is being accessed before it has been defined or initialized. Also, `self._cached` is being used to append elements to it without proper initialization, which may lead to unexpected behavior.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
One possible approach to fix the bug is to initialize `self._cached` as an empty list before appending elements to it. Additionally, the logic for accessing `self._cached` needs to be revisited to ensure it is being used after initialization.

Corrected code:
```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    self._cached = [commands[0]] + sorted(
        commands[1:], key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
