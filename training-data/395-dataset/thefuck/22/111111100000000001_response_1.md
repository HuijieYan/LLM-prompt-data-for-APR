The potential error in the `_realise` function is the call to `_remove_duplicates(self._commands)`. It seems that the function `_remove_duplicates` is intended to be a method of the `SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence` class, but it's currently defined as a standalone function.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `_remove_duplicates` function is intended to be a method of the `SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence` class, but it's defined as a standalone function instead. This results in a `self` parameter being passed to a non-existent method, causing a runtime error.

To fix the bug, we need to move the `_remove_duplicates` function inside the `SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence` class and change its signature to include the `self` parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence(object):
    """
    List-like collection/wrapper around generator, that:
    
    - immediately gives access to the first commands through [];
    - realises generator and sorts commands on first access to other
      commands through [], or when len called.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # corrected signature of a relative function in this class
    def _remove_duplicates(self, corrected_commands):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass



    # this is the corrected function
    def _realise(self):
        """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
        commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
        self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
        self._realised = True
        debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
            self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
