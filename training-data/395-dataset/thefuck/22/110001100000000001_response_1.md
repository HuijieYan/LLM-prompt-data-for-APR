The issue with the provided function is that the `_remove_duplicates` method is being called as a regular function, rather than as a method of the same class. Additionally, the `corrected_commands` parameter is not being passed correctly.

To fix this issue, we need to remove the `self` parameter from the `_remove_duplicates` method signature, and call it as a method of the same class.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_22/thefuck/types.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def _remove_duplicates(corrected_commands):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# this is the corrected function
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
        commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```

By making these changes, the `_remove_duplicates` method will be called correctly as a method of the same class, and the `corrected_commands` parameter will be passed correctly.
