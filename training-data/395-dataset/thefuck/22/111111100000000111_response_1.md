Potential error location: The `_remove_duplicates` function is likely causing the bug.

Reasons behind the bug: The `_remove_duplicates` function is not returning any value and the corrected_commands are not being modified.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `_remove_duplicates` function to return the corrected list with duplicates removed.
2. Use the returned value from `_remove_duplicates` to update the `self._commands` list.

Corrected code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_22/thefuck/types.py

# class declaration containing the buggy function
class SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence(object):
    """
    List-like collection/wrapper around generator, that:
    
    - immediately gives access to the first commands through [];
    - realises generator and sorts commands on first access to other
      commands through [], or when len called.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # corrected _remove_duplicates function
    def _remove_duplicates(self, corrected_commands):
        return list(set(corrected_commands))

    # this is the fixed function
    def _realise(self):
        """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
        commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
        self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
        self._realised = True
        debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
            self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
