Potential Error Location:
The error likely lies in the line:
self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
1. It seems like 'self._cached' is being used without being defined.
2. No comparison operator is being specified for the 'sorted' function.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that 'self._cached' is properly defined and initialized before being used.
2. Provide a comparison operator for the 'sorted' function so that it knows how to sort the 'corrected_commands' list.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    self._cached = [commands[0]] + sorted(
        commands[1:], key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
