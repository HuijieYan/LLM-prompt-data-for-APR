Potential error location: 
The error is likely in the line `self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)`. This line is attempting to modify the `self._cached` list, but the code is structured in a way that may not always guarantee the existence of an element at index 0 in `self._cached`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The code assumes that `self._cached` list has at least one element, and it tries to access `self._cached[0]` directly without checking if the list is empty. This can lead to an "IndexError" if `self._cached` is empty.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
One way to fix the bug is to check if the `self._cached` list is empty before accessing its first element. If it's empty, then add an empty list to `self._cached` before performing the sorting operation.

Corrected code:
```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    
    if not self._cached:  # Check if self._cached is empty
        self._cached = [[]]  # If empty, add an empty list
    
    self._cached = self._cached + sorted(
        commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
