The error message indicates an "IndexError" related to the line `self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(...)`, which suggests that the index used to access `self._cached` is out of range. This means that `self._cached` is an empty list, and trying to access its first element will result in an IndexError.

The issue likely arises from trying to access the first element of an empty list, which should have been handled in the code. To fix this bug, the code should check whether `self._cached` is empty before trying to access its first element.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    
    if self._cached:  # Check if _cached is not empty
        first_element = [self._cached[0]]
    else:
        first_element = []
    
    self._cached = first_element + sorted(
        commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```

By checking whether `self._cached` is not empty before trying to access its first element, we prevent the IndexError from occurring.
