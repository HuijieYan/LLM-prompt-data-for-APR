Potential error location: The error is likely to be in the _remove_duplicates method, as it is being called to remove duplicates from the list of commands.

Reasons behind the bug:
1. The _remove_duplicates method is not defined properly, or it is not an instance method of the class where it is being called.
2. It is not receiving the correct input parameter for corrected_commands.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define the _remove_duplicates method properly as an instance method of the class.
2. Ensure that the _remove_duplicates method takes the correct input parameter and returns the corrected list of commands without duplicates.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_22/thefuck/types.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def _remove_duplicates(self, corrected_commands):
    return list(set(corrected_commands))

# corrected _realise method
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
        commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
