The error message "IndexError: list index out of range" indicates that the code is trying to access an index that does not exist in the list. The specific line causing the error is:

```python
self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
    commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
```

This line is trying to access the first element of `self._cached` list, but `self._cached` seems to be empty or does not have enough elements.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line mentioned above.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that `self._cached` is being accessed without checking if it has any elements or is empty.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `self._cached` has at least one element before trying to access it.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    if self._cached:
        self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    else:
        self._cached = sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
