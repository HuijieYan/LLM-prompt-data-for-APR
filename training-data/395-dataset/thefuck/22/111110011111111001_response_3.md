The error message indicates that there is an IndexError (list index out of range) in the `_realise` method of the `SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence` class.

Analysis:
The error is likely occurring at the line:
```python
self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
```
Here, `self._cached` is being accessed at index 0, but it is an empty list. This is causing the IndexError.

Reason for the bug:
The issue is occurring because `self._cached` is an empty list, and the code tries to access `self._cached[0]` without first checking if the list is empty.

Approach for fixing the bug:
To fix this bug, you should check if `self._cached` is empty. If it is empty, you can assign the sorted `commands` directly to `self._cached`. If it is not empty, you can append the sorted `commands` to `self._cached`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_realise` method:

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    if not self._cached:
        self._cached = sorted(commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    else:
        self._cached += sorted(commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```

In the corrected code, it first checks if `self._cached` is empty. If it is, it simply assigns the sorted `commands` to `self._cached`. If it is not empty, it appends the sorted `commands` to `self._cached` using the `+=` operator.
