Potential error location: The _remove_duplicates method is being called with the self._commands parameter, but the method signature suggests that it takes a separate "corrected_commands" parameter. This indicates a mismatch in the number of parameters being passed to the _remove_duplicates method.

Reasons for the occurrence of the bug: The _remove_duplicates method is not being called correctly with the correct parameters. This results in an incorrect behavior and can lead to potential errors.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Update the _realise method to correctly call the _remove_duplicates method with the appropriate parameters.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_22/thefuck/types.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def _remove_duplicates(self, corrected_commands):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# corrected function
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self, self._commands)  # Corrected the method call
    self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
        commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
