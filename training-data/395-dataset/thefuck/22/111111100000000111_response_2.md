Potential error:
The function `_remove_duplicates` is not structured as a method of the class `SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence`. It should be indented to be a method of the class.

Reason for the bug:
The `_remove_duplicates` function is intended to be a method of the class `SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence`, but it is currently not indented correctly to be considered part of the class.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Indent the `_remove_duplicates` function so that it becomes a method of the class `SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence`.
2. Make sure that the `self` parameter is included in the function's signature to indicate that it is a method of the class.

Corrected code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_22/thefuck/types.py

# corrected function's signature in this file
def _remove_duplicates(self, corrected_commands):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# class declaration containing the corrected function
class SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence(object):
    """
    List-like collection/wrapper around generator, that:
    
    - immediately gives access to the first commands through [];
    - realises generator and sorts commands on first access to other
      commands through [], or when len called.
