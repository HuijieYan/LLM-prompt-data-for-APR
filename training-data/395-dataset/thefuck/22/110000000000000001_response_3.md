Potential Error:
The line `commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)` is attempting to call a `_remove_duplicates` method on the class instance, but it seems like the method is not defined.

Reason for the Bug:
The `_remove_duplicates` method is being called without being defined in the class, leading to a NameError.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
Define the `_remove_duplicates` method within the class, or use a built-in Python function to remove duplicates from the list.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = list(set(self._commands))  # remove duplicates
    self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
        commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
