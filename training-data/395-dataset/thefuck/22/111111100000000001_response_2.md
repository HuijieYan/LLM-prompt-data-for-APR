Potential error:
The `_remove_duplicates` method is called with `self._commands`, but the method signature does not include the `self` parameter. It seems like this method should be an instance method, but it is incorrectly defined as a standalone function.

Reason behind the bug:
The `_remove_duplicates` method is meant to be an instance method of the `SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence` class, but it is defined as a standalone function. This causes issues when trying to access instance variables like `self._commands`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Change the `_remove_duplicates` method to be an instance method by including the `self` parameter in its signature.
2. Move the `_remove_duplicates` method inside the `SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence` class.

Corrected code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_22/thefuck/types.py

# class declaration containing the corrected function
class SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence(object):
    """
    List-like collection/wrapper around generator, that:
    
    - immediately gives access to the first commands through [];
    - realises generator and sorts commands on first access to other
      commands through [], or when len called.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # corrected signature of the relative function in this class
    def _remove_duplicates(self, corrected_commands):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # this is the corrected function
    def _realise(self):
        """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
        commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
        self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
        self._realised = True
        debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
            self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
