The error occurs in the `_realise` method of the `SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence` class. The error message indicates that an "IndexError: list index out of range" is being raised at the line `self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(...)`. This suggests that `_cached` is empty, resulting in an attempt to access an index that does not exist.

The potential error location within the `_realise` method is the line `self._cached = [self._cached[0]]`, which assumes that `_cached` contains at least one element.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely that the `_cached` attribute is not initialized or populated with any values before this line is executed.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that `_cached` is properly initialized before attempting to access its first element.

Here's the corrected code for the `_realise` method:

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    if commands:
        self._cached = [commands[0]] + sorted(
            commands[1:], key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    else:
        self._cached = []
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```

In the corrected code, we check if `commands` is not empty before attempting to access its elements. If it is not empty, we initialize `_cached` with the first element of `commands` and the sorted remaining elements. If it is empty, we simply initialize `_cached` as an empty list.
