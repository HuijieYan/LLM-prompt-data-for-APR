The error message indicates that there is an 'IndexError' occurring in the '_realise' function of the 'SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence' class from the file '/Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_22/thefuck/types.py'. The issue seems to be related to the '_cached' attribute, specifically with the index being out of range. 

The reason for this bug could be that the '_cached' attribute is being accessed with an index of 0, which might not exist when the sequence is empty. This results in the 'IndexError' when trying to access the first element of the '_cached' list.

To fix this bug, a check for the existence of the first element in '_cached' should be added before accessing it. If the list is empty, it should be properly initialized.

The corrected code for the '_realise' method is as follows:

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    if self._cached:  # Check if _cached is not empty
        self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    else:  # Initialize _cached if empty
        self._cached = sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
