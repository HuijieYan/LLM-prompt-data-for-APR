The error message indicates an "IndexError" at line 85 of the `thefuck/types.py` file. This error occurs when trying to access the first element of `self._cached`, which is an empty list. The problematic line is:

```python
self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
```

The issue is that `self._cached` is an empty list, and therefore `self._cached[0]` results in an IndexError.

The bug occurred due to the incorrect initialization of `self._cached` and potentially other variables in the `SortedCorrectedCommandsSequence` class, leading to unexpected behavior during the `_realise` method.

To fix the bug, the initialization and handling of `self._cached` and other relevant variables need to be corrected. Additionally, the logic for checking the condition of `self._cached` before accessing its elements needs to be improved.

Here's the corrected function with the potential fixes:

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates, and sorts commands."""
    if not self._realised:  # Check if not already realized
        commands = list(self._commands)  # Convert _commands to a list
        commands = self._remove_duplicates(commands)  # Remove duplicates
        if commands:  # Check if commands is not empty
            self._cached = [commands[0]] + sorted(
                commands[1:], key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
        else:  # If commands is empty, _cached should also be empty
            self._cached = []
        self._realised = True
        debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
            self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```

In this corrected code, we explicitly convert the `_commands` iterator to a list, then remove duplicates. Before accessing the first element of `commands`, we also check if `commands` is not empty to avoid IndexError. If `commands` is empty, then `_cached` is also set to an empty list. Finally, the `_realised` flag is set to True only after performing the necessary operations.
