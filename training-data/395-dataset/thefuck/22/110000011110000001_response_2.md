Potential error location: The line `self._cached = [self._cached[0]]` within the `_realise` method is likely causing the "IndexError: list index out of range" error.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: 
- It seems that the `self._cached` list is expected to have at least one element, but it may be empty when the method is called. This results in an "IndexError" because the code tries to access the first element of the empty list.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Check the length of `self._cached` before accessing its elements to avoid the "IndexError".
- Add validation to ensure that `self._cached` has at least one element before performing any index-based operations on it.

Corrected code for the `_realise` method:

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)
    if self._cached:  # Check if self._cached is not empty
        self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    else:
        self._cached = sorted(
            commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```

In the corrected code, the length of `self._cached` is checked before accessing its elements. If it's not empty, the element is accessed. Otherwise, the sorting is performed directly on `commands` without trying to access `self._cached[0]`.
