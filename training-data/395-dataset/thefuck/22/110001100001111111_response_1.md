Potential error location: The potential error is in the line `commands = self._remove_duplicates(self._commands)`. The function `_remove_duplicates` is being called with the argument `self._commands`, which is a list_iterator type, and it is expected to be a list.

Reason for the bug: The `_remove_duplicates` function is expecting a list as input, but it is receiving a list_iterator instead. This is causing the function to fail, resulting in a potential error.

Approach to fix the bug: Convert the list_iterator to a list before passing it to the `_remove_duplicates` function.

Corrected code:

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    corrected_commands = list(self._commands)  # Convert list_iterator to a list
    commands = self._remove_duplicates(corrected_commands)
    self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
    commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
