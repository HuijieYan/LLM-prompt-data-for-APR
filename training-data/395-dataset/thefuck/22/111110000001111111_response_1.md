The potential error in the `_realise` function is that `self._commands` is a list_iterator object, which cannot be directly sorted. This is likely the cause of the error.

To fix this issue, we need to convert the `list_iterator` object `self._commands` into a list before sorting and removing duplicates.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _realise(self):
    """Realises generator, removes duplicates and sorts commands."""
    commands = list(self._remove_duplicates(list(self._commands)))
    self._cached = [self._cached[0]] + sorted(
        commands, key=lambda corrected_command: corrected_command.priority)
    self._realised = True
    debug('SortedCommandsSequence was realised with: {}, after: {}'.format(
        self._cached, '\n'.join(format_stack())), self._settings)
```
