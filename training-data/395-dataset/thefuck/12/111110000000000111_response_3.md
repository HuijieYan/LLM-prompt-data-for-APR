Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is in the use of the @sudo_support decorator.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The @sudo_support decorator is not a standard Python decorator and it might be causing issues with the function's execution.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Remove the @sudo_support decorator if it's not necessary for the function.
2. If the @sudo_support decorator is essential, ensure that it is defined and implemented correctly.

Corrected Code:
```python
def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts
            and 'not found' in command.stderr
            and bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0], get_all_executables())))
```
