Potential error location: The 'which' function is being used in the code, but it is not defined or imported within the function or the code file. This is leading to the "AttributeError" in the test case, where it's unable to find the 'which' attribute.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The 'which' function is being used within the 'match' function, but it's not defined or imported. This causes the AttributeError in the test cases, as the 'which' attribute is not found within the 'no_command' module.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Import the 'which' function from a relevant module within the 'no_command' module.
2. Define the 'which' function within the 'no_command' module.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_12/thefuck/rules/no_command.py
from thefuck.utils import which  # Import the 'which' function

# Corrected match function with 'which' function imported

def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts
            and 'not found' in command.stderr
            and bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0],
                                       get_all_executables())))
```
