Issue:
The `@sudo_support` decorator in the buggy function is not defined, resulting in a NameError. Additionally, the `get_close_matches` and `get_all_executables` functions are not imported or defined, leading to more errors.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The `@sudo_support` decorator is not defined, resulting in a NameError when the function is called.
2. The `get_close_matches` and `get_all_executables` functions are not imported or defined, causing errors when they are called within the `match` function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. If the `@sudo_support` decorator is meant to provide sudo support for the function, it should be properly defined and implemented.
2. Import the necessary functions (`get_close_matches` and `get_all_executables`) from their respective modules if they exist. If not, define them within the same module as the `match` function.

Corrected code:

```python
from difflib import get_close_matches
from subprocess import getoutput
import os

def sudo_support(func):
    # define the sudo_support decorator
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        # define sudo support logic
        pass
    return wrapper

@sudo_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts
            and 'not found' in command.stderr
            and bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0],
                                       get_all_executables())))

def get_all_executables():
    # define logic to get all executables
    return []

# Test the fixed function
def test_match():
    command = Command(script='qweqwe', stderr='qweqwe: not found')
    assert not match(command)
```

In the corrected code:
- The `@sudo_support` decorator has been defined with a placeholder implementation. This can be replaced with actual sudo support logic.
- The `get_close_matches` and `get_all_executables` functions are either imported or defined within the same module as the `match` function.
- The test case has been updated to use the fixed `match` function.
