The bug in the given code is related to the condition in the 'match' function. The function is supposed to check if the command is not found by checking the 'not found' error message in the command's stderr and if there are any close matches to the command in the script_parts. 

The bug occurs because it is checking for 'not found' in the error message even when there is a close match available from the script_parts. This causes incorrect behavior and may result in false positives.

To fix this bug, the condition should be modified to check for 'not found' in stderr only if no close matches are found in script_parts.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from difflib import get_close_matches
from thefuck.utils import get_all_executables
from thefuck.specific.sudo import sudo_support

@sudo_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts
            and (not get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0], get_all_executables())
            or 'not found' in command.stderr))
```
