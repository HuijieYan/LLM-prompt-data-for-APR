The error occurs in the test function due to a missing attribute 'which' in the module 'thefuck.rules.no_command'. The problematic function 'match' is seemingly trying to access this attribute, which is not defined in the module, leading to the AttributeError.

To fix this bug, the 'which' method or attribute needs to be defined within the 'thefuck.rules.no_command' module. This could involve adding the necessary implementation for the 'which' attribute within the module.

Here is the corrected function/method:

```python
# A corrected version of the function
from difflib import get_close_matches
from thefuck.utils import get_all_executables
from thefuck.specific.sudo import sudo_support

@sudo_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts
            and 'not found' in command.stderr
            and bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0],
                                       get_all_executables())))
```
