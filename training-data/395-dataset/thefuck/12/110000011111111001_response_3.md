The error appears to be caused by the usage of a decorator `@sudo_support` before the `match` function, but the implementation of this decorator is not provided. This causes `sudo_support` to raise an AttributeError when trying to access an attribute 'which' which is not present.

To fix this issue, either provide the implementation of the `sudo_support` decorator or remove the `@sudo_support` decorator from the `match` function if it's not necessary.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts
            and 'not found' in command.stderr
            and bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0],
                                       get_all_executables())))
```

Remove the `@sudo_support` decorator from the original buggy function code and then test the function again.

After removing the `@sudo_support` decorator, the `match` function should work without causing any AttributeError, and the test cases provided should pass without any issues.
