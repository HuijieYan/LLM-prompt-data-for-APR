The buggy function seems to be checking if a command is not found based on the presence of the string 'not found' in the command's stderr and if the first part of the command is a close match to any of the available executables.

The potential error location within the function is the comparison of the command script parts with the executables. The 'command.script_parts' is checked against the list of all executables to find a close match, but it should only check the first item in 'command.script_parts' against the list of executables.

The bug occurs because the 'command.script_parts' is a list, and the current implementation does not correctly handle this list to extract the first command to match with available executables.

To fix the bug, we need to extract the first item from 'command.script_parts' and then check if it's a close match to any of the executables.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
from difflib import get_close_matches

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_12/thefuck/rules/no_command.py

@sudo_support
def match(command):
    if command.script_parts:
        first_command = command.script_parts[0]
        return 'not found' in command.stderr and bool(get_close_matches(first_command, get_all_executables()))
    return False
```
In this corrected code, we first check if 'command.script_parts' contains any items. If it does, we extract the first command from it and check for 'not found' in the stderr. Then we find a close match for the first command among the available executables.

This fixed code should address the issues and produce the correct behavior for the 'match' function.
