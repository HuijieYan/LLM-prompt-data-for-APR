The error seems to be related to calling the `mocker.patch` method with the attribute 'which' in the `thefuck.rules.no_command` module, which doesn't exist.

The reason for this error is that the `sudo_support` decorator is being used on the `match` function. However, the implementation of this decorator is not provided. This may cause issues with the function's behavior, especially in the context of the test cases.

To fix this issue, the `sudo_support` decorator should be implemented correctly or removed if not necessary.

Assuming the `sudo_support` decorator is not relevant, the corrected `match` function is as follows:

```python
def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts
            and 'not found' in command.stderr
            and bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0], get_all_executables())))
```

If the `sudo_support` decorator is necessary and correctly implemented, you can update the `match` function to include it:

```python
@sudo_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts
            and 'not found' in command.stderr
            and bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0], get_all_executables())))
```
