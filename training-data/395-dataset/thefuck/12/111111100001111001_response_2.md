The buggy function `match` checks if the command is not found based on the presence of the phrase "not found" in the command's stderr. It also checks if the command script is similar to any of the executables available.

The buggy code has several issues: 
1. It uses `get_close_matches` without importing it.
2. It doesn't handle the scenario where the script is not found but is not similar to any of the executables.
3. It assumes that the first element in `command.script_parts` is the command, which may not always be true.

To fix the issues, the following approach can be taken:
1. Import the `get_all_executables` method if it's not already imported.
2. Use a try-except block to handle the case where `get_close_matches` is not available.
3. Check if the command script is not found and is similar to any executable before returning True.

Here's the corrected function for the buggy code:

```python
# Required import
from difflib import get_close_matches

# Corrected function
@sudo_support
def match(command):
    try:
        return (
            command.script_parts
            and 'not found' in command.stderr
            and get_close_matches(command.script_parts[-1], get_all_executables())
        )
    except NameError:
        return False
```
