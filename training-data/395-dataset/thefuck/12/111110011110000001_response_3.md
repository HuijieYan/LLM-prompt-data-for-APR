The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError, specifically that the module 'thefuck.rules.no_command' does not have the attribute 'which'. This error occurs when trying to patch the 'which' function from the 'thefuck.rules.no_command' module.

The potential error location is the '@sudo_support' decorator in the function definition. It seems that the '@sudo_support' decorator is not handling the 'which' attribute correctly.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be due to the incorrect implementation of the '@sudo_support' decorator. It might not be properly handling the function being decorated and the patched attributes.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the '@sudo_support' decorator to properly handle the attributes of the function being decorated.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts
            and 'not found' in command.stderr
            and bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0],
                                       get_all_executables())))
```

If the decorator is necessary for sudo support, then it needs to be fixed to properly handle the attributes and provide the necessary functionality without causing the AttributeError.
