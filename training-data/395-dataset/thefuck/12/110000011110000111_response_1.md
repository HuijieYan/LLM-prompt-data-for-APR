The error message indicates that the function `match` is trying to access the attribute `which` in the module `thefuck.rules.no_command`, but this attribute does not exist in the module.

It seems that the function `match` is trying to access an attribute from the imported module `thefuck.rules.no_command`, specifically the attribute `which`, but this attribute is not present in the module.

To fix this issue, the function `match` should be modified to access the variable `which` directly instead of trying to access it as an attribute of the module.

The corrected code for the `match` function is as follows:

```python
def match(command):
    which = get_all_executables()
    return (
        command.script_parts
        and 'not found' in command.stderr
        and bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0], which))
    )
```

In this corrected code, the `which` variable is explicitly set to the result of `get_all_executables()`, and then used as a variable within the function. This approach avoids the error related to accessing the `which` attribute from the `thefuck.rules.no_command` module.
