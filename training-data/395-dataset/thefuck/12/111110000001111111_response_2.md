The buggy function seems to be checking whether the command thrown an error containing "not found" and if the script part of the command matches any of the executables. The problem seems to be with the presence of the 'sudo_support' decorator, which is not defined in the given code. 

Given the test cases, it's likely that the function is supposed to check if the command has thrown a "not found" error and if so, whether there are any close matches to the script in the list of executables.

To fix the bug, the 'sudo_support' decorator needs to be removed and the function should directly accept the 'command' object as an argument.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
from difflib import get_close_matches

def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts
            and 'not found' in command.stderr
            and bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0],
                                       get_all_executables())))
```

This modified version of the function removes the decorator and directly accepts the 'command' object as an argument.
