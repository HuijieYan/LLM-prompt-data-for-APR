The error occurs in the `mocker.patch` line inside the `test_not_match` function. It tries to patch the `which` attribute from the `thefuck.rules.no_command` module, but it fails because the module doesn't have an attribute named `which`.

The bug occurs because the `match` function is referencing an attribute `which` that doesn't exist within the `thefuck.rules.no_command` module. The code tries to patch this non-existent attribute, leading to the AttributeError.

To fix this bug, we should modify the `match` function to remove the reference to the `which` attribute or define it within the `thefuck.rules.no_command` module.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from difflib import get_close_matches
from thefuck.utils import get_all_executables
from thefuck.decorators import sudo_support

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_12/thefuck/rules/no_command.py

# corrected function
@sudo_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts
            and 'not found' in command.stderr
            and bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0],
                                       get_all_executables())))
```

By removing the reference to the non-existent `which` attribute, the corrected `match` function should now work properly.
