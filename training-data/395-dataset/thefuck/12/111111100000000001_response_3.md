Potential error location: The `get_close_matches` function is being called without being imported.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The `get_close_matches` function is not defined within the scope of the buggy function, which causes a NameError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Import the `get_close_matches` function from the `difflib` module.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_12/thefuck/rules/no_command.py
from difflib import get_close_matches

# this is the corrected function
@sudo_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts
            and 'not found' in command.stderr
            and bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0], get_all_executables())))
```
