The error occurs because the 'which' attribute is not present in the 'no_command' module, and the mocker is trying to patch it. This is leading to the AttributeError.

The potential error location is in the test function where the mocker is trying to patch 'which' attribute in the 'no_command' module.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the mocker is trying to patch an attribute that does not exist in the 'no_command' module, causing the AttributeError.

To fix the bug, either the 'which' attribute needs to be added to the 'no_command' module, or the test needs to be modified to patch an attribute that does exist in the module.

Fixed code for the problematic function:

```python
import shutil
from difflib import get_close_matches
from thefuck.utils import for_app

@for_app('open', at_least=1)
def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts
            and 'not found' in command.stderr
            and bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0],
                                       get_all_executables())))
```
In this corrected code, the 'which' attribute is replaced with 'get_all_executables' which is a valid attribute in the 'no_command' module.
