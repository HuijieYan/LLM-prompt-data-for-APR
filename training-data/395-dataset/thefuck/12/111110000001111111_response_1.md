The buggy function `match` is using a decorator `@sudo_support`, which is not defined in the given code. Assuming the intention is to check if the command is not found and return True if there are similar executables available, the function seems to be trying to use the `get_close_matches` function from the `difflib` module. However, the import statement for `get_close_matches` is missing in the provided code.

The potential error location is in the missing import statement for the `get_close_matches` function.

The error occurs because the `get_close_matches` function is not imported in the given code. Therefore, the function cannot be used without importing it.

To fix the bug, we need to import the `get_close_matches` function from the `difflib` module and remove the `@sudo_support` decorator, assuming it was included by mistake.

```python
# Fix for the buggy function
import difflib

def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts
            and 'not found' in command.stderr
            and bool(difflib.get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0], get_all_executables())))
```

This should fix the bug by importing the required function and removing the undefined decorator.
