The buggy function is attempting to match a command name in the error message "not found" using the `get_close_matches` function to suggest potential correct commands. The bug occurs because the `get_close_matches` function is undefined and it's not importing from any library.

To fix this bug, the `get_close_matches` function should be imported from the `difflib` library. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import difflib

@sudo_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts
            and 'not found' in command.stderr
            and bool(difflib.get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0], get_all_executables())))
```
