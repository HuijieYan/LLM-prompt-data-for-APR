Potential error location: The error occurs in the `mocker.patch` statement within the `test_not_match` function. The error message indicates that the attribute 'which' is not found in the module `thefuck.rules.no_command`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `mocker.patch` statement is attempting to patch the 'which' attribute within the `thefuck.rules.no_command` module, but it's not found.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the `which` attribute is a part of the `thefuck.rules.no_command` module or import it from another module if needed.
2. Check if the `which` attribute is being correctly imported or defined within the module.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_12/thefuck/rules/no_command.py

# Corrected function with added import statement
from difflib import get_close_matches
from shutil import which
from thefuck.utils import sudo_support
from thefuck.types import Command


@sudo_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts
            and 'not found' in command.stderr
            and bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0],
                                       get_all_executables())))
```
