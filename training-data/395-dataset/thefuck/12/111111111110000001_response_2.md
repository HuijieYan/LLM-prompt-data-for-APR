The error message indicates that the function `match` is trying to access an attribute `which` that does not exist within the module `thefuck.rules.no_command`. This is causing an `AttributeError` when the test function attempts to patch this attribute.

The issue is occurring because the `match` function is trying to access the `which` attribute, but it is not defined in the function or its enclosing scope. This could be due to the fact that the `which` attribute is being used but not defined or imported within the `match` function.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `which` attribute is properly defined or imported within the `match` function or its enclosing scope. Depending on the purpose of the `which` attribute, it should be obtained from the appropriate source or imported from an external module.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
from difflib import get_close_matches
from shutil import which

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_12/thefuck/rules/no_command.py

# Corrected function
@sudo_support
def match(command):
    all_executables = get_all_executables()
    return (command.script_parts
            and 'not found' in command.stderr
            and bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0], all_executables)))
```

In this corrected code, the `which` attribute is imported from the `shutil` module, which seems to be the intended source for this attribute. Additionally, the `get_all_executables` function is called to obtain the `all_executables` variable, which is then used to fix the `match` function.
