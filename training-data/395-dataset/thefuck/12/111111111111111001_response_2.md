The error occurs because the `which` attribute is being patched in the test cases but it's not provided in the actual implementation of the `match` function. 

The `which` attribute needs to be implemented in the `match` function, and it should return the actual path to the executable by querying the underlying operating system.

Below is the corrected implementation of the `match` function:

```python
from difflib import get_close_matches
from shutil import which

@sudo_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts
            and 'not found' in command.stderr
            and bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0], [which(command.script_parts[0])])))
```

In this corrected implementation, the `which` function from the `shutil` module is used to determine the full path of the executable if it exists. Then, the `get_close_matches` function is used to check if the command is misspelled or not found.

This approach ensures that the `which` functionality is correctly implemented, and it addresses the issues encountered in the test cases.
