Potential error location: The use of the @sudo_support decorator suggests that this function requires elevated privileges to run certain commands. 

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The function is not handling the sudo command properly. It assumes that 'not found' in the command.stderr means the command is not found, which may not be the case when using sudo.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Check for the 'not found' error only if sudo is not used. If sudo is used, handle the error differently.

Corrected code:
```python
def match(command):
    if not command.sudo:
        return (command.script_parts
                and 'not found' in command.stderr
                and bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0],
                                           get_all_executables())))
    else:
        return ('not found: {}' in command.stderr.format(command.script_parts[0]))
```
