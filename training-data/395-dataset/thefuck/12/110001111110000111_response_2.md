The error message indicates that the `which` attribute is not found in the module 'thefuck.rules.no_command'. This points to the fact that either the module 'thefuck.rules.no_command' does not have the 'which' attribute, or the patching process fails to find the attribute.

The bug occurs because the 'which' attribute is being patched using `mocker.patch()`, but there is no 'which' attribute present in the module 'thefuck.rules.no_command'.

To fix this bug, either the 'which' attribute needs to be added to the module 'thefuck.rules.no_command' or the patching process needs to be updated to patch an existing attribute.

Here's the corrected function that addresses the issue:

```python
from difflib import get_close_matches
from thefuck.utils import get_all_executables
from thefuck.decorators import sudo_support

@sudo_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts
            and 'not found' in command.stderr
            and bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0],
                                       get_all_executables())))

```

In this corrected function, the `which` attribute has been removed completely. If the `which` attribute is necessary, it should be added to the module and patched accordingly.
