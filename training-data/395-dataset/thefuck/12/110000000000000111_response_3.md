Potential Error Location:
The error could potentially be in the use of the @sudo_support decorator, as it is not a standard Python decorator.

Reasons for the Bug:
The @sudo_support decorator is not a standard decorator in Python, and it's likely causing the function to fail.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Remove the @sudo_support decorator if it is not necessary for the function.
2. If sudo support is required, implement it within the function instead of using a non-standard decorator.

Corrected Code:
```python
def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts
            and 'not found' in command.stderr
            and bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0],
                                       get_all_executables())))
```
If sudo support is required, it can be implemented within the function body itself.
