Potential error location: The error might be in the usage of the `@sudo_support` decorator. This is likely causing the function to not behave as expected.

Reasons behind the bug: The `@sudo_support` decorator may not be properly implemented or may not be compatible with the `match` function.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Remove the `@sudo_support` decorator from the function, as it seems to be causing the issue. If `sudo_support` functionality is required, it should be implemented or used in a way that does not interfere with the `match` function.

Corrected code:

```python
def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts
            and 'not found' in command.stderr
            and bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0],
                                       get_all_executables())))
```
