The error occurs in the `mocker.patch` line of the test function. It is trying to patch the `which` attribute of the `thefuck.rules.no_command` module, but the `which` attribute is not present in the module, resulting in an AttributeError.

The potential error location within the `match` function is the use of the `which` attribute, which is not defined or imported.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `which` attribute is not defined in the `thefuck.rules.no_command` module, which causes the `mocker.patch` to fail.

To fix the bug, the `which` attribute needs to be imported or defined in the `thefuck.rules.no_command` module.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_12/thefuck/rules/no_command.py

from shutil import which

# Use sudo_support decorator if needed
# @sudo_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts
            and 'not found' in command.stderr
            and bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0],
                                       get_all_executables()))
            and bool(which(command.script_parts[0])))
```

This code imports the `which` function from the `shutil` module and uses it to check if the command exists. This should fix the bug and allow the test function to run successfully.
