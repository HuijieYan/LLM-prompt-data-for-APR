The buggy function has a decorator `@sudo_support` which is not a built-in Python decorator. It seems that the actual intention was to use the `@functools.wraps` decorator to preserve the original function's signature. 

The error message is related to the inability to find the 'which' attribute within the module 'thefuck.rules.no_command'. This problem could be related to the fact that the `which` attribute is not being imported or defined in the correct way.

One approach to fixing the bug is to use the correct decorator (`@functools.wraps`) to ensure the original function's signature is preserved. Additionally, the 'which' attribute should be correctly imported or defined within the module.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import functools

def sudo_support(func):
    @functools.wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        # sudo support implementation
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

# Applying the sudo_support decorator
def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts
            and 'not found' in command.stderr
            and bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0], get_all_executables())))
```
