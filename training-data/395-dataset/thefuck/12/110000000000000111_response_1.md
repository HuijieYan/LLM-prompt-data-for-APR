Potential error location: The decorator @sudo_support is not defined.

Reason for the occurrence of the bug: The decorator @sudo_support is not defined in the provided code, so it causes a syntax error when trying to execute the function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define the @sudo_support decorator to be used with the match function.
2. If the @sudo_support decorator is not necessary, remove it from the function definition.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts
            and 'not found' in command.stderr
            and bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0],
                                       get_all_executables())))
```
