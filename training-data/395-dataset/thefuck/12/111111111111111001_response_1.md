The error is occurring because the `mocker.patch` method is attempting to patch the `thefuck.rules.no_command.which` attribute, which does not exist in the given file.

The bug is caused by the absence of the `which` attribute within the `no_command.py` file. To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `which` attribute exists within the specified file. 

Additionally, the `match` function itself seems to be incomplete and lacks proper functionality for matching the command. To fix this, we need to implement the correct logic for matching the command as per the requirements.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_12/thefuck/rules/no_command.py

from difflib import get_close_matches
from thefuck.utils import get_all_executables

def match(command):
    if command.script_parts \
            and 'not found' in command.stderr:
        if any(get_close_matches(cmd, get_all_executables()) for cmd in command.script_parts):
            return True
    return False
```
In the corrected code, the `match` function has been completely rewritten. It now checks if there are script parts and 'not found' in the command's standard error. If these conditions are met, it checks if any script part matches any of the available executables using `get_close_matches`. If such a match is found, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.
