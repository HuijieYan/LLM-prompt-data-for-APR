The error is occurring because the `@sudo_support` decorator is missing a module or is not properly defined. This results in an AttributeError when attempting to mock the 'which' attribute.

To fix this issue, the `@sudo_support` decorator should be defined properly and the `match` function should be updated to incorporate it.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
from functools import wraps

def sudo_support(func):
    @wraps(func)
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        # logic for sudo support
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@sudo_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts
            and 'not found' in command.stderr
            and bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0],
                                       get_all_executables())))
```

By defining the `sudo_support` decorator as shown and applying it to the `match` function, the issue with the `which` attribute should be resolved.
