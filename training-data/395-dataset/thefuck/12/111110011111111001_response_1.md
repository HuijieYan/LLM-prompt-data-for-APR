The error in the provided code is because of the decorator `@sudo_support`. The `@sudo_support` decorator is attempting to modify the behavior of the `match` function, but it seems that it may be causing conflicts with the testing framework and other functions.

To fix this issue, you can remove the `@sudo_support` decorator from the `match` function. This will allow the function to behave as intended without any conflicts.

Here's the corrected `match` function without the `@sudo_support` decorator:

```python
def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts
            and 'not found' in command.stderr
            and bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0], get_all_executables())))
```
