The error occurs when the test function attempts to patch the 'which' attribute of the 'thefuck.rules.no_command' module. This error message indicates that the 'which' attribute does not exist in the 'no_command' module.

The potential error location is within the 'no_command.py' file, where the 'which' attribute should be defined or imported. It seems that the 'which' attribute is missing or not properly imported in the 'no_command.py' file.

To fix this bug, the 'which' attribute should be properly defined or imported in the 'no_command.py' file. This can be done by either defining the 'which' function within the 'no_command.py' file or importing it from a different module.

The corrected code for the problematic function 'match' in 'no_command.py' is as follows:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_12/thefuck/rules/no_command.py

from difflib import get_close_matches
from shutil import which

@sudo_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts
            and 'not found' in command.stderr
            and bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0],
                                       get_all_executables())))
```
