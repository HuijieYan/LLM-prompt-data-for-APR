The buggy function seems to be using the `@sudo_support` decorator, but since the decorator is not provided in the code, it is causing a syntax error. Additionally, there are some issues with how the `command.script_parts` and `command.stderr` values are being utilized to determine a match.

The function is trying to check if the command is not found by looking for the string 'not found' in the `command.stderr`. However, it is not considering the case where the command itself is not found or misspelled.

To fix the function, we would remove the `@sudo_support` decorator since it is not provided and modify the logic to account for the different ways a command could be not found.

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
from difflib import get_close_matches

def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts
            and ('not found' in command.stderr.lower()
                 or not any(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0], get_all_executables())))
           )
```

In the corrected code:
1. The `@sudo_support` decorator has been removed.
2. The `command.script_parts` and `command.stderr` are used to check if the command is not found, accounting for different error messages and scenarios.
3. The `get_close_matches()` function from the `difflib` module is used to check for close matches of the command in case of misspellings.
