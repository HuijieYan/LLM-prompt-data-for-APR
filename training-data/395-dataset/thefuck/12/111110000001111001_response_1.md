The buggy function is using a decorator `@sudo_support` which is not defined in the code provided. It's also using a function `get_close_matches` and `get_all_executables` which are not defined in the given code. We will assume that these functions are defined elsewhere in the codebase.

One potential reason for the bug is that the `@sudo_support` decorator may not be handling the `command` object correctly, leading to incorrect behavior when accessing `command.script_parts` and `command.stderr`.

To fix the bug, we can remove the `@sudo_support` decorator and directly handle the logic inside the `match` function. We will also fix the logic of returning True only if the command is not found in the error message and matches with any executable.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from difflib import get_close_matches

# Correction for the buggy function
def match(command):
    if 'not found' in command.stderr:
        matched_executables = [exec for exec in get_all_executables() if exec in command.script_parts[0]]
        return bool(matched_executables)
    else:
        return False
```

In the corrected code, we have removed the `@sudo_support` decorator and fixed the logic to check if 'not found' is in the command.stderr. If it is, we then check if there are any executables that match the command.script_parts[0] and return True if there are any matches. Otherwise, we return False.
