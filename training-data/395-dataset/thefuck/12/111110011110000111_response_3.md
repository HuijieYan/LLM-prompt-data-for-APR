The error is occurring because the function `match` is trying to access the attribute `get_all_executables()` which is not defined anywhere. This is why the test cases are failing with the error `does not have the attribute 'which'`.

To fix this issue, we need to define the `get_all_executables()` function or import it from a module if it exists elsewhere. Assuming that the `get_all_executables()` function is defined in a module called `utils`, the corrected code for the `match` function would look like this:

```python
from utils import get_all_executables  # assuming get_all_executables is defined in a module called utils

def match(command):
    return (command.script_parts
            and 'not found' in command.stderr
            and bool(get_close_matches(command.script_parts[0],
                                       get_all_executables())))
```

By importing `get_all_executables` from the `utils` module or defining it within the same module as the `match` function, we can fix the AttributeError and make the function work as expected.
