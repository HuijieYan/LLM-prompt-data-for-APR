The buggy function is designed to check if the command entered by the user is not found and if there are any close matches to the entered command among the available executables.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the implementation of the 'match' function itself.

The bug in the function is that it checks for the presence of 'not found' in the stderr of the command, but it does not take into account the fact that the command itself might contain spaces. This is evident from the input parameter runtime value and type for buggy function in Buggy case 2. 

To fix the bug, the function should first join the elements in `command.script_parts` where the list elements are joined with a space to form the full command. Then, it should check if the joined script is in the `command.stderr` instead of comparing with the command.script_parts[0].

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from difflib import get_close_matches
from thefuck.utils import get_all_executables
from thefuck.specific.sudo import sudo_support

@sudo_support
def match(command):
    full_command = ' '.join(command.script_parts)
    return (full_command
            and 'not found' in command.stderr
            and bool(get_close_matches(full_command, get_all_executables())))
```
