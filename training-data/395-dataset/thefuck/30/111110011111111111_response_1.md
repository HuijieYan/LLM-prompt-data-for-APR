The issue with the `match` function is that it always returns the result of the `_search` function without actually checking the content of the `command.stderr` and environment variable `EDITOR` as intended.

### Bug Explanation
The bug occurs because the condition to check if `'EDITOR'` is in the `os.environ` dictionary is not properly verified. Additionally, there is an unresolved reference to the function `_search` which might be intended to be a call to a regular expression search function.

### Approach to Fix
1. We need to properly check if `'EDITOR'` is in `os.environ` and also parse the content of `command.stderr` for a match.
2. If a regular expression search is intended, we will need to import the appropriate module (e.g., `re`) and use its search function to find a match in `command.stderr`.

### Corrected Code
```python
import os
import re

def match(command, settings):
    if 'EDITOR' in os.environ:
        return re.search(r'pattern', command.stderr) is not None
    else:
        return False
```
