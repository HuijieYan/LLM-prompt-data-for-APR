The issue in the given code is that the `match` function is not properly implemented. It should be modified to correctly check for the 'EDITOR' environment variable and call the `_search` function with the `stderr` parameter.

Here are the instructions for fixing the bug:

1. Add an import statement for the `os` module at the beginning of the file: `import os`
2. Modify the `match` function to properly check for the 'EDITOR' environment variable and call the `_search` function with the `stderr` parameter.

Here's the corrected `match` function:

```python
import os

def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and _search(command.stderr)
```

By implementing these changes, the `match` function should work properly and pass the test cases.
