The issue with the provided function is that it uses the variable `m` which appears to be the result of a regex search, but the actual regex is not present in the code provided. Additionally, the function `_search` is not implemented, which leads to the actual issue with the `match` function as well.

To fix this, we need to implement the `_search` function to perform the necessary regex search on the input `stderr`. Then, we should use the result of this search to determine the return value of the `match` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
import os
import re

# implementation of _search function
def _search(stderr):
    pattern = 'your_regex_pattern_here'  # replace with the actual regex pattern
    return re.search(pattern, stderr)

# correct implementation of match function
def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and _search(command.stderr) is not None
```

Replace `'your_regex_pattern_here'` with the actual regex pattern that should be used to search the `stderr` input. This implementation will fix the issue and provide the expected behavior for the `match` function.
