Potential error location:
The indentation for the "match" function is incorrect, as it is inside the "_search" function. Also, the "os" module is used without being imported, which could cause an error.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The "match" function is not properly defined due to the incorrect indentation, and the "os" module is used without being imported.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Fix the indentation so that the "match" function is not nested inside the "_search" function.
2. Import the "os" module at the beginning of the file to use it within the "match" function.

Corrected code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_30/thefuck/rules/fix_file.py

import os

def _search(stderr):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and _search(command.stderr)
```
