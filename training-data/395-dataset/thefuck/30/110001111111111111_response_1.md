The buggy function `match` is not functioning correctly. The function is designed to return True if the environment variable 'EDITOR' is present and it finds a specific error in the command's stderr, as determined by the `_search` function. However, the function is returning a regular expression match object instead of the expected Boolean value.

The potential error location in the code is within the `match` function where it checks the condition `'EDITOR' in os.environ` and calls the `_search` function. The return value of `_search` is not being utilized properly to return a Boolean value.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the return value of the `_search` function is being considered but not used to explicitly determine if the match was found or not.

To fix the bug, we need to utilize the return value of the `_search` function and explicitly check if the match was found or not.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_30/thefuck/rules/fix_file.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def _search(stderr):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# corrected function
def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and _search(command.stderr) is not None
```

In the corrected code, after calling the `_search` function, we explicitly check if the return value is not `None` using the `is not None` comparison, and then return the result. This ensures that the function returns a Boolean value as expected.
