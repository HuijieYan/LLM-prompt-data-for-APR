The function `match` has several issues that need to be corrected based on the given buggy function, the input parameter's runtime values and types, as well as the expected values and types of the runtime values.

Here's the corrected `match` function:

```python
import os
import re

def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and _search(command.stderr)

def _search(text):
    return re.search(r'^\s*(File|/|[\w\.\-]+):(\d+):(\d+)', text, re.MULTILINE)
```
