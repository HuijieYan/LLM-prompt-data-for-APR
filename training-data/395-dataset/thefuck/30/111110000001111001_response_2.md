The bug in the `match` function is that it is missing the import statement for the `os` module. Additionally, there is a missing `_search` function which is being called but not defined.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
import os
import re

def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and re.search(r':\d+:\d+:', command.stderr)
```
