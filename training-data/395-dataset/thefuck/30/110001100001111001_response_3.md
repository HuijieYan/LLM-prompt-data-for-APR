Potential error location: The buggy code uses `command.stderr` directly instead of using `command.stderr` as an attribute.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The function calls the `_search` method using `command.stderr` directly, but `command.stderr` is not an attribute of the `command` object.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Access the `stderr` attribute of the `command` object instead of using `command.stderr` directly.
2. Modify the `_search` method to accept `command.stderr` as a parameter.

```python
# Corrected function
def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and _search(command.stderr)
```
