Potential error location: The buggy function `match` is expecting `command.stderr` to have an attribute `stderr`, but it actually belongs to `command` object.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `_search` function is being called on `command.stderr`, but it should be called on `command`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Change the `command` object to `command.stderr` in the `match` function.
2. Access the `stderr` attribute of the `command` object and then call the `_search` function.

```python
# relative function's signature in this file
def _search(stderr):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# corrected function
def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and _search(command.stderr)
```
