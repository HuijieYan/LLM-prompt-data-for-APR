Potential error: The function `match` is not properly indented, and it's missing the import statement for `os`.

Reason for the bug: The function `match` is not correctly defined within the main function, and the required module `os` is not imported in this code snippet.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Indent the function `match` properly and add the import statement for `os`.

Corrected code:

```python
import os  # Add the missing import statement here

# relative function's signature in this file
def _search(stderr):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# Correct the function definition and indentation
def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and _search(command.stderr)
```
