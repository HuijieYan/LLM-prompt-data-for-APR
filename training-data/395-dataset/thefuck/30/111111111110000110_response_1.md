The provided function `match` needs to be indented correctly. It should be at the same level as the `_search` function. Here's the corrected function:

```python
# Buggy function source code
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_30/thefuck/rules/fix_file.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def _search(stderr):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and _search(command.stderr)
```
