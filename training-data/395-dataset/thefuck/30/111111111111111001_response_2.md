The `match` function has several issues. 

1. It refers to `Command(stderr=...)`, but the function receives `stderr` only as a parameter, not as a keyword argument.
2. The `re.Match` object is being returned directly. It should instead return a boolean based on whether the `_search` function returned a match or not.

To fix this function, the following changes need to be made:

1. The `match` function should take `stderr` as a parameter and pass it to `_search` function.
2. The `re.Match` object returned by the `_search` function should be used to determine the return value of the `match` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
import os
import re

def _search(stderr):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def match(stderr, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and bool(_search(stderr))
```

By making these changes, the `match` function will correctly handle the `stderr` parameter and return a Boolean value based on the result of the internal `_search` function.
