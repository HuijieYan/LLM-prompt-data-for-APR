The bug in the provided function `_search(stderr)` is that the `match` function should have a different signature and it's indentation is off.

The reason for the bug is that the `match` function is not properly defined with the right signature, and its indentation is off which makes it part of the `_search` function.

To fix this bug, we need to define the `match` function with the proper signature and indentation.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_30/thefuck/rules/fix_file.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def _search(stderr):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# this is the corrected and properly indented match function
def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and _search(command.stderr)
```
