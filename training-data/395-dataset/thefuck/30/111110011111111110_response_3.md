The variable `os` must be imported from the `os` module. Also, the method `_search` must be defined or imported in the code as well.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
import os

def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and re.search(r'[a-zA-Z]+\.\w+:\d+:\d+:', command.stderr)
```
