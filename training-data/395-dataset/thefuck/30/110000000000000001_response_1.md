Potential error location: The function is not importing the os module, and the _search function is not defined.

Reason for the bug: The os module is not imported, and the _search function is not defined within the function or the global scope.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Import the os module and define the _search function or remove the reference to it.

Corrected code:

```python
import os

def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ
```
In the corrected code, we have imported the os module and removed the reference to the _search function, which was not defined in the original code. This should fix the bug.
