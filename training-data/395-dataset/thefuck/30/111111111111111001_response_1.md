The error in the given code occurs because the `match` function is returning a regular expression match object, but the test function is expecting the returned value to be `False`. This mismatch causes the assertion error in the test cases.

The potential error location in the `match` function is the `return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and _search(command.stderr)` line. This line does not return a boolean value to indicate whether the match was found or not.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug are:
1. The `match` function is not returning a boolean value as expected by the test function.
2. The `_search` function is not being used correctly within the `match` function.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `match` function to correctly utilize the `_search` function and return a boolean value based on its result.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
import re
import os

def _search(stderr):
    m = re.search('expected expression', stderr)  # Update the regular expression pattern as per the use case
    return m is not None

def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and _search(command.stderr)
```

With this corrected code, the `match` function will properly utilize the `_search` function and return a boolean value according to the presence of the search pattern in the `stderr`.

After applying these changes, the test cases should pass without any assertion errors.
