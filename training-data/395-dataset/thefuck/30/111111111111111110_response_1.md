The provided snippet is the source code of a method or function in Python. The function has a bug and it needs to be fixed.

Based on the error messages, it seems that the goal of the function is to return a Boolean value based on some conditions and argument values.

Here is the fixed version of the function:

```python
import os  # Ensure to import os module
  
# Define the _search function outside the match function
# This is a placeholder for the _search function implementation
def _search(stderr):
    pass
  
# Fix the buggy function
def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and _search(command.stderr)  # Return value matches expected output

```

In the above code:
- It fixes the indentation to ensure that the code structure is correct.
- The match function now checks if 'EDITOR' is present in os.environ and then calls the `_search` function with the `command.stderr` as an argument to get the return value.

I've provided a fixed implementation of the function based on assumptions about the expected behavior. You should replace the `_search` placeholder with the actual implementation of the `_search` function to ensure that the logic of the fix is correct and the function meets its intended purpose.
