Potential Error Location: The indentation of the `match` function is incorrect, as it is defined within the `_search` function.

Reasons Behind Bug:
The `match` function should be a separate function, but it is currently defined within the `_search` function due to incorrect indentation. This will cause a syntax error.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
The `match` function should be properly indented at the same level as the `_search` function. 

Corrected Code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_30/thefuck/rules/fix_file.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def _search(stderr):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# Corrected match function
def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and _search(command.stderr)
```
