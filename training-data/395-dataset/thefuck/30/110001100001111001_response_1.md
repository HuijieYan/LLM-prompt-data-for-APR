The buggy function `match` is trying to check if the 'EDITOR' environment variable exists and if the `_search` function returns a truthy value. However, there are multiple issues with this function: 

1. The function is currently considering the `command` parameter as an object with `stderr` attribute, but it should be treated as a `Command` object, where `stderr` is an attribute.

2. The condition 'EDITOR' in `os.environ` is missing and it only checks if the 'EDITOR' is present but doesn't have any impact on the final output. 

Below is the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
import os

def _search(stderr):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and _search(command.stderr)
```
