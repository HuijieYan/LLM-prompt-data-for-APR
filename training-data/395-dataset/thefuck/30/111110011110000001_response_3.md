The problematic function is the `match` function. The function checks if the environment variable 'EDITOR' is in the os environment and searches for a pattern in the standard error stream. However, the function is incomplete and does not handle the pattern correctly, which leads to assertion errors in the test functions.

The reason for the bug is that the `_search` function is not defined, and the `match` function does not include the necessary logic to correctly match the pattern in the standard error stream.

To fix the bug, the `_search` function needs to be defined, and the `match` function should use this function to correctly search for the pattern in the standard error stream.

Here is the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
import os
import re

# Define _search function
def _search(stderr):
    pattern = 'your_pattern_here'  # Replace 'your_pattern_here' with the actual pattern to search
    return re.search(pattern, stderr)

# Corrected match function
def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and _search(command.stderr) is not None
```
