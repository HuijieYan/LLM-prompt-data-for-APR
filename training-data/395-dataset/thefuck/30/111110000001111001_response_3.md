The potential error in the buggy code is the use of `_search` without defining it in the `match` function. The code should also import the `os` module to check for the `EDITOR` environment variable.

The corrected code for the `match` function is as follows:

```python
import os

def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and re.search(r'a\..*:\d+:\d+:', command.stderr)
```
