The issue appears to be that the `match` function is returning a `re.Match` object instead of a boolean value. Let's fix the function by returning a boolean instead.

Here's the corrected `match` function:

```python
# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ or _search(command.stderr)
```
