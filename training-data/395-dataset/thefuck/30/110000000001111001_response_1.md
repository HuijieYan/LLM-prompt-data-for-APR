The issue with the `match` function is that it checks for the presence of the 'EDITOR' environment variable using `os.environ`, but it doesn't import the `os` module. Additionally, the function refers to an undefined function `_search`. It seems like the intention was to use the `re.search` function to search for a pattern in the error message.

To fix the issue, the `os` module needs to be imported, and the `re.search` function should be used to search for a pattern in the error message.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
import os
import re

def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and re.search(r':\d+:\d+:', command.stderr)
```
