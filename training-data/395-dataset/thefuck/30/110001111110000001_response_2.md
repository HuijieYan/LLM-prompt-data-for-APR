The bug in the provided code seems to be located in the `match` function. The issue is likely caused by the incorrect usage of the `re.Match` object. The code tries to assert that the result of the `match` function is not an object of type `re.Match`, which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, the comparison should be based on the return value of the `_search` function that is being called within the `match` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_30/thefuck/rules/fix_file.py

import os

# relative function's signature in this file
def _search(stderr):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# this is the fixed function
def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and not _search(command.stderr)
```
