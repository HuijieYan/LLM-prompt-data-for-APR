```python
# importing regex library
import re
import os
from Command import Command

def _search(error_text: str) -> re.Match:
    return re.search(r'(\w+.\w+:\d+:\d+):', error_text)

def match(command: Command, settings: str) -> bool:
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and _search(command.stderr)

```

The buggy function `match` has been corrected as shown above. A new function `_search` is added to the `match` function. The `_search` function is used to find a pattern in the `error_text` sent through it.
