The bug in the given `match` function seems to be with the `_search` method being called. This method has not been defined or imported within the function, which causes the error.

The reason for the bug is that the `_search` method is being called without being defined or imported. This is likely a typo or missing import.

To fix the bug, the `_search` method needs to be defined or imported within the `match` function. If it's an external method, it should be imported at the beginning of the file where the `match` function is located.

```python
import os

def _search(stderr):
    # implementation of the _search method
    pass

def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and _search(command.stderr)
```

By defining or importing the `_search` method, the function should work correctly.
