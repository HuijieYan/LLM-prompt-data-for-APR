The problematic function is the `match` function. The error message from the test function indicates that the `match` function is returning a regular expression match object instead of the expected boolean value. This is likely due to the `_search` function not being called and returning a boolean value.

The potential error location is within the `match` function, specifically in the return statement.

The bug occurs because the `match` function is not calling the `_search` function to check for a condition. Additionally, the `return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and _search(command.stderr)` statement is not returning a boolean value.

To fix the bug, the `match` function should call the `_search` function and return the result as a boolean value.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_30/thefuck/rules/fix_file.py

import os

# relative function's signature in this file
def _search(stderr):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# corrected and fixed function
def match(command, settings):
    return 'EDITOR' in os.environ and _search(command.stderr) is not None
```
