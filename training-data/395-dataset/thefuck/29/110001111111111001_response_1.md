The function `update` is supposed to return a new `Settings` object with updated values. However, there are several issues in the function implementation:
1. It incorrectly initializes the `conf` dictionary with `dict(self)` instead of `self`.
2. It incorrectly updates the `conf` dictionary with the `kwargs` without considering the original key-value pairs in the `self` object.

As a result, the tests fail because the updated values do not match the expected values.

To fix the bug, the correct approach is to:
1. Initialize the `conf` dictionary with the content of `self` rather than `dict(self)`.
2. Update the `conf` dictionary using the `self` object and then the `kwargs`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Returns new settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    conf = dict(self)  # Initialize conf with self's content
    for key, value in kwargs.items():
        conf[key] = value  # Update conf with kwargs

    return Settings(conf)  # Return new Settings object
```

With these changes, the function should behave as expected and pass the tests.
