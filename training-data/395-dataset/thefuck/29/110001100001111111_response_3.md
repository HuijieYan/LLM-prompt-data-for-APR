The bug in the `update` method is that it returns a `Settings` object, but the `conf` variable is a dictionary. The expected behavior is to return a new `Settings` object with the updated values.

To fix this bug, we need to update the code to create a new `Settings` object with the updated values from `kwargs`, and then return this new object.

Here's the corrected code for the `update` method:

```python
# relative function's signature in this file
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Returns new settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    conf = dict(self)
    conf.update(kwargs)
    return Settings(conf)
```
