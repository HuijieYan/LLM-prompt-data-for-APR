The issue with the given code is that the 'update' function of the 'Settings' class is supposed to update the existing settings with new values from `kwargs`, but it is currently returning a new instance of 'Settings' instead of updating the existing instance.

The potential error is located in the return statement of the 'update' function, where it creates a new instance of 'Settings' with the updated configuration, instead of updating the existing instance.

The reason behind the bug is that the 'update' function should modify the existing instance of 'Settings' with new values, rather than creating a new instance with the updated values.

To fix the bug, the 'update' function should modify the existing instance directly and return 'None' instead of creating a new instance with the updated configuration.

Here is the corrected code for the 'update' function:

```python
# Corrected function for the 'update' method
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Updates the settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    self.update(kwargs)
```
