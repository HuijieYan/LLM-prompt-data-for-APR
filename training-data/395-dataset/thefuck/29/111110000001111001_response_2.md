The buggy function is intended to update the settings with new values from the input `kwargs` and return a new Settings object. However, it is not achieving this goal due to the use of the `conf` variable to store the updated settings.

The bug occurs because the `conf` variable is being updated with the new values from `kwargs` before creating a new Settings object. This means that subsequent updates to the new Settings object will also modify the original `conf` variable, leading to unexpected behavior and incorrect settings.

To fix this bug, the function should create a new instance of the Settings class with the updated settings, rather than modifying the `conf` variable. This will ensure that each update creates a new independent Settings object.

Here's the corrected code for the `update` function:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class Settings(dict):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def update(self, **kwargs):
        """Returns new settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
        conf = dict(self)
        conf.update(kwargs)
        return Settings(conf)
```

With this fix, the function will correctly return a new Settings object with the updated settings, maintaining the original settings unchanged.
