The potential error in the buggy function is that it is trying to create a new `Settings` object with the updated configuration settings, but it is not implemented correctly. 

The `update` function should update the existing `Settings` object with the new values from `kwargs` instead of creating a new `dict`. 

To fix this bug, we can directly update the existing `Settings` object with the new values from `kwargs` and return the updated `self` object.

Here's the corrected code for the `update` function:

```python
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Updates the settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    self.update(kwargs)
    return self
```
