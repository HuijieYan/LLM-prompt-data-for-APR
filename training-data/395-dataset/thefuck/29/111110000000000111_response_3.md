Potential error location: The bug is caused by the fact that the `update` method is supposed to update the existing settings with the new values from `kwargs`, but it currently creates a new `Settings` instance instead of updating the existing one.

Reason behind the bug: The `update` method is supposed to update the existing settings in place, but instead, it creates a new `Settings` instance with the updated values.

Approaches for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, we need to modify the `update` method to update the existing settings in place rather than creating a new instance.

Corrected code for the `update` method:

```python
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Updates settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    self.update(kwargs)
```

With this correction, the `update` method will now correctly update the existing settings with the new values from `kwargs`.
