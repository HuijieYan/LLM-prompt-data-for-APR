Potential Error Location: The issue seems to be in the `update` method of the `Settings` class.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug in the `update` method is that it should update the settings with new values from `kwargs`, but currently, it is not correctly updating the existing values.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Remove the line `conf = dict(self)` and directly call `conf = self` so that the `update` method will update the original settings.
2. Instead of returning a new instance of `Settings`, update the existing instance itself and return `self` after updating.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class Settings:
    def __init__(self, settings):
        self.settings = settings
    
    def update(self, **kwargs):
        """Update settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
        self.settings.update(kwargs)
        return self
```

The corrected `update` method directly updates the existing settings with new values from `kwargs`. Now, the tests should pass without any assertion errors.
