The issue with the `update` function is that it seems to be using `self` as if it were a dictionary, but `self` is actually an instance of the `Settings` class. 

This causes the `update` function to throw an error when it tries to return a new instance of `Settings` with the updated configuration. 

To fix the bug, the `update` function should convert `self` to a dictionary before performing the update, and then construct a new `Settings` instance using the updated dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the `update` function:

```python
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Returns new settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    conf = dict(self)  # Convert self instance to a dictionary
    conf.update(kwargs)
    return Settings(conf)  # Construct a new Settings instance using the updated dictionary
```

This modification should ensure that the `update` function correctly updates the settings and returns a new `Settings` instance with the updated values.
