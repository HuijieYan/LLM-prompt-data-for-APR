Potential error location: The `update` function is attempting to create a new dictionary `conf` using `dict(self)`, which would result in a TypeError since `self` is not a mapping type.

Reasons behind the bug: The `update` function is trying to create a dictionary from an object that is not a mapping type, leading to a TypeError.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the `vars()` function to convert the object to a dictionary.
2. Use the `self.__dict__` attribute to convert the object to a dictionary.

Corrected code:

```python
# Corrected function
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Returns new settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    conf = self.__dict__
    conf.update(kwargs)
    return Settings(**conf)
```
