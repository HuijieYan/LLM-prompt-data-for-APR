The potential error in the function is the incorrect usage of the `update` method. The `conf` dictionary should be updated with the values from `kwargs`, but the current implementation doesn't achieve this correctly.

The bug occurs because the `update` method modifies the `conf` dictionary in place, and then the function returns a new `Settings` object instead of a dictionary.

To fix this, we need to update the `conf` dictionary with the values from `kwargs` and then return it directly instead of creating a new `Settings` object.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Returns new settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    conf = dict(self)
    conf.update(kwargs)
    return conf
```
