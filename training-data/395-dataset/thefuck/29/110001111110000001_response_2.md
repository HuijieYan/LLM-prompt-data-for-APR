Potential error location: 
The issue lies in the update method of the Settings class. The update method is expected to update the settings with new values from the input dictionary, but it is not performing as expected.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the existing code does not correctly update the settings with new values from the input dictionary. Instead, it retains the old values and overrides the new ones.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to correctly update the settings with new values from the input dictionary. This can be achieved by modifying the existing code to update the "conf" dictionary with the input "kwargs" and return a new instance of the Settings class with the updated values.

Here's the corrected code for the update method of the Settings class:

```python
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Returns new settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    conf = dict(self)
    conf.update(kwargs)
    return Settings(conf)
```

By using the updated code, the update method correctly updates the settings with new values from the input dictionary and returns a new instance of the Settings class with the updated values.
