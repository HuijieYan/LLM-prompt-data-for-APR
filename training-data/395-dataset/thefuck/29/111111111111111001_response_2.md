The issue with the provided code is in the `update` method of the `Settings` class. The method creates a new `Settings` instance every time it's called, which causes the original settings to be lost. To fix the issue, the `update` method should modify the existing settings instead of creating a new instance every time.

The reason for the bug is that the `update` method is returning a new `Settings` instance with the updated values instead of modifying the current instance. This results in the original settings not being retained.

To fix the bug, the `update` method should modify the `self` dictionary directly and return `None`. The corrected `update` method is as follows:

```python
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Updates the settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    self.update(kwargs)
```

This way, the `update` method will update the settings with the new values from `kwargs` and retain the original settings. This should resolve the issues reported in the test functions as well.
