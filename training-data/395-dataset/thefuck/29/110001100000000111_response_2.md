Potential Error:
The code is trying to use `dict(self)` to create a new dictionary from `self`, which is probably causing a TypeError, as `self` may not be directly convertible to a dictionary.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The `dict()` function doesn't work directly on `self` because `self` is an instance of a class, not a dictionary.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
We should access the internal dictionary of the `Settings` object and then update it with the `kwargs` instead of trying to convert the whole object to a dictionary.

Corrected Code:
```python
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Returns new settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    conf = dict(self.__dict__)
    conf.update(kwargs)
    return Settings(conf)
```
