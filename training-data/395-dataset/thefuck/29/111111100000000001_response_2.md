Potential error location: The error is likely in the update method of the Settings class.

Reason for the bug: The update method in the Settings class is intended to update the settings with new values from `kwargs`, however, the current implementation creates a new dictionary `conf` with the original settings and then updates this new dictionary with the values from `kwargs` instead of updating the original settings.

Approach to fix the bug: Instead of creating a new dictionary and updating it with the values from `kwargs`, directly update the original settings dictionary with the values from `kwargs`.

Corrected code:

```python
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Update settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    self.update(kwargs)
```
