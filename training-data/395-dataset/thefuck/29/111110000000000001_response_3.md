Potential error location: The issue with the provided code is that the `update` method is defined twice in the class `Settings`. This will cause the second definition of the `update` method to overwrite the first one, as Python methods are defined using the latest definition.

Reason for the bug: The first definition of the `update` method is not being utilized at all because the second definition is overwriting it. This can lead to unexpected behavior and can cause confusion for developers trying to use the class.

Approach for fixing the bug: Remove the second definition of the `update` method and use the first definition, and modify it to return the updated instance of the `Settings` class with the new values from `kwargs`.

Corrected code for the `update` method:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class Settings(dict):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # signature of the corrected function in this class
    def update(self, **kwargs):
        """Returns new settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
        new_settings = Settings(self)  # create a new instance of Settings
        new_settings.update(kwargs)  # update the new instance with the provided kwargs
        return new_settings  # return the updated instance

    # ... other methods ...
```
