The issue here is with the `update` method of the `Settings` class. It is not correctly updating the settings with the new values from `kwargs`.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the `update` method is not updating the `Settings` object with the new values from `kwargs` as expected. Instead, it is creating a new dictionary `conf`, updating it with the new `kwargs`, and then returning a new `Settings` object from this updated dictionary. This leads to incorrect behavior when checking the values of the new settings object.

To fix this, we can directly update the existing settings object with the new values from `kwargs` using the `update` method of a dictionary.

Here's the corrected `update` method:

```python
# relative function's signature in this file
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Updates new values from `kwargs` in the settings."""
    self.update(kwargs)  # Directly update the settings with the new values
    return self  # Return the updated settings
```

With this correction, the updated settings object will contain the correct new values, and the test cases that were failing should now pass.
