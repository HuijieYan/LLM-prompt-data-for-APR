The bug in the provided function is that it is trying to create a new `Settings` object using the `Settings` class, but the `Settings` class is not defined in the code snippet provided.

To fix the bug, we will assume that the `Settings` class has already been defined elsewhere. We will modify the function to simply update the dictionary `self` with the values from `kwargs` and return it.

Here's the corrected code for the `update` function:

```python
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Returns new settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    conf = dict(self)
    conf.update(kwargs)
    return conf
```

This modified function will create a new dictionary `conf` containing the updated settings, and return it instead of trying to create a new `Settings` object, which is not defined in the given code snippet.
