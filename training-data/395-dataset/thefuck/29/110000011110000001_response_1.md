The function `update` has multiple issues:
1. It is using `self` as a dictionary and trying to call `dict(self)`, which will throw a `TypeError`.
2. The update function should modify the original dictionary and return it instead of returning a new `Settings` object.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the original dictionary is not being updated correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the original dictionary `self` and then return it.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Modifies the current settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    self.update(kwargs)
```

This modification ensures that the original dictionary is updated with the new values from `kwargs`. This should resolve the issues observed in the test functions.
