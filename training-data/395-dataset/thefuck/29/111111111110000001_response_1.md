The error occurs because the `update` method of the `Settings` class is not updating the settings as expected. The method doesn't modify the original object, and instead, it creates a new `Settings` object with the updated settings.

To fix this issue, the correct approach would be to directly modify the `conf` dictionary and update the existing settings.

Here is the corrected code for the `update` method:

```python
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Update existing settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    self.update(kwargs)
```

The corrected `update` method modifies the existing settings with the new values provided in `kwargs` without creating a new `Settings` object. This update should resolve the issues seen in the provided test cases.
