The bug seems to be in the way the `update` method of the `Settings` class is implemented. Based on the test cases and the error messages, it seems that the `update` method is not updating the values correctly.

The buggy function is taking the existing settings, updating them with new values, and then returning a new `Settings` object with the updated values. However, the new `Settings` object is being created with the wrong values.

The correct approach to fix this bug is to directly update the existing settings with the new values, then return the modified settings directly without creating a new `Settings` object.

Here's the corrected code for the `update` method:

```python
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Updates the settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    self.update(kwargs)
    return self
```

With this corrected code, the `update` method directly updates the existing settings with the new values and returns the modified settings. This should fix the bug and resolve the error messages in the test functions.
