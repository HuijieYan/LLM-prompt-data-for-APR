The potential error in the function "update" is that it is not correctly updating the settings with the new values from `kwargs`. Instead of updating the `kwargs` to the existing settings, it is incorrectly returning the settings without updating them.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the original implementation of the `update` function is not correctly modifying the settings with the new values provided in `kwargs`. It is supposed to update the existing settings with the new values, but it is not doing so.

To fix the bug, the implementation of the `update` function should be modified to correctly update the settings with the new values from `kwargs`.

Here's the corrected code for the `update` function:

```python
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Returns new settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    conf = dict(self)  # Create a copy of the existing settings
    conf.update(kwargs)  # Update the copy with the new values
    return Settings(conf)  # Return the updated settings
```

With this correction, the function now correctly updates the existing settings with the new values from `kwargs` and returns the updated settings.

This should resolve the issues seen in the test cases and error messages.
