The potential error in the provided function is that it is trying to create a new `Settings` object using the `conf` dictionary, but it seems that `Settings` is not defined within the function. This will result in an error when trying to create a new `Settings` object.

To fix this bug, we can import the `Settings` class (assuming it exists in an imported module) and then use it to create a new `Settings` object with the updated `conf` dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_29/thefuck/types.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def update(self, **kwargs):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

    # corrected function
    from some_module import Settings  # Replace some_module with the actual module where Settings is defined

    def update(self, **kwargs):
        """Returns new settings with new values from `kwargs."""
        conf = dict(self)
        conf.update(kwargs)
        return Settings(conf)
```
