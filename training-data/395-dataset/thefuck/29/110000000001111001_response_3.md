The potential error in the `update` function is that it is trying to create a new `Settings` object using the `Settings` class constructor, but the input `conf` is a dictionary not a `Settings` object. This will result in a TypeError.

To fix the bug, we need to create a new `Settings` object from the updated dictionary `conf` before returning it.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
class Settings:
    def __init__(self, settings):
        self.settings = settings

    def update(self, **kwargs):
        """Returns new settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
        conf = self.settings.copy()
        conf.update(kwargs)
        return Settings(conf)
```
With this corrected code, we first create a copy of the original settings dictionary using `copy()` method, then we update it with the new values from `kwargs` before creating a new `Settings` object and returning it.
