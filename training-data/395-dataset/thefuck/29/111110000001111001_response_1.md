The bug in the provided function is that it is returning a new instance of the `Settings` class instead of updating the current instance. This is because the `update` method is creating a new `Settings` instance with the updated configuration and returning it, instead of updating the current instance's configuration.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `update` method to update the current instance's configuration instead of creating a new instance.

Here's the corrected code for the `update` method:

```python
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Updates the settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    self.update(kwargs)
```

With this change, the `update` method will now correctly update the current instance's configuration with the new values provided in `kwargs`.
