Upon analyzing the buggy function, it appears that the `update` method is creating a new `Settings` instance with the values from both `self` and `kwargs`. However, this results in the `kwargs` values overwriting the `self` values, leading to an incorrect behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `update` method to directly update the existing `Settings` instance rather than creating a new one. This can be achieved by using the `update` method of the `dict` class and updating the `self` instance with the `kwargs`.

Here's the corrected code for the `update` method:

```python
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Update settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    self.update(kwargs)
```

This code directly updates the `self` instance with the values from `kwargs`, resulting in the expected behavior as described in the test cases.
