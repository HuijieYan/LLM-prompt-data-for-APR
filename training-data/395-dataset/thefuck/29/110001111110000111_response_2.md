The error originates from the `update` method of the `Settings` class. The issue seems to be with the way the method is updating the settings. It is not updating the values correctly, leading to assertions failing in the test cases.

The problematic area is likely the `update` method where the `conf.update(kwargs)` statement appears to be the culprit. This is because the `conf.update(kwargs)` statement is incorrect and is updating the values in an unintended manner, leading to the test cases failing as they expect a different outcome.

To fix the bug, the `update` method should be modified to correctly update the settings by updating the values using the `kwargs` parameter in a way that reflects the test expectations.

Here's the corrected code for the `update` method:

```python
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Returns new settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    conf = dict(self)  # Creating a copy of the current settings
    conf.update(kwargs)  # Updating the settings with the new values from kwargs
    return Settings(conf)  # Returning the updated settings
```

With the provided corrected code for the `update` method, the buggy behavior should be resolved, and the test cases should pass without errors.
