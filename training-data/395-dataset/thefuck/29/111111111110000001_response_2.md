The problem here is that the `update` method is currently returning a new instance of `Settings` with the merged configuration, but the original test cases are expecting the original `settings` instance to be updated in place.

To fix this, we need to modify the `update` method to update the settings in place instead of returning a new `Settings` instance. We can achieve this by using the `dict.update()` method to merge the configurations.

Here's the corrected method:

```python
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Update existing settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    self.update(kwargs)
```

With this change, the original `settings` instance will be updated in place, and the test cases should pass as expected.
