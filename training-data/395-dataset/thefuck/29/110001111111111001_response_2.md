Potential error location: Within the `update` function of the `Settings` class.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `update` function is not correctly updating the `self` values with the new values provided in `kwargs`. It is creating a new dictionary `conf`, updating it with the `kwargs`, and then returning a new `Settings` object with the updated values. However, this does not change the original `self` values, which leads to the incorrect results in the test cases.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `update` function to directly update the `self` values with the new values from `kwargs`.
2. Instead of creating a new `Settings` object, modify the existing `self` object and return it.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_29/thefuck/types.py

# relative function's signature in this file
class Settings:
    def __init__(self, settings):
        self.settings = settings

    def update(self, **kwargs):
        """Returns updated settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
        self.settings.update(kwargs)
        return self
```

With this corrected implementation, the `update` function will directly update the `self` object with the new values from `kwargs` and return the updated `self` object. This would resolve the issues in the test cases and eliminate the errors.
