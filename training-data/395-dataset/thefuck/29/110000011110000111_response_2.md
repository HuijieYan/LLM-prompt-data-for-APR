Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the `update` method of the `Settings` class. It is expected to update the settings with new values from `kwargs`, but it doesn't seem to be working as expected.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
- The `update` method is creating a new dictionary `conf` by copying the existing settings, then updating it with the new values. However, when creating the `Settings` object at the end, it seems to be using the original settings `self`, instead of the updated `conf`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Use the updated `conf` when creating the new `Settings` object at the end of the method.
- Ensure that the `conf` dictionary is correctly updated with the new values from `kwargs`.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class Settings:
    def __init__(self, settings):
        self.settings = settings

    def update(self, **kwargs):
        """Returns new settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
        conf = dict(self.settings)
        conf.update(kwargs)
        return Settings(conf)
```
In this corrected code, the `Settings` class is defined to properly handle the `update` method. The `update` method now correctly updates a new dictionary `conf` with the existing settings and the new values from `kwargs`. Then, it uses the updated `conf` to create a new `Settings` object and return it.
