The problem with the `update` function is that it is trying to create a new `Settings` object with the updated values using the `Settings` constructor, but it is not accepting the updated dictionary of values as a parameter.

To fix this bug, the `update` function should directly return the updated `conf` dictionary without trying to create a new `Settings` object.

Here's the corrected `update` function code:

```python
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Returns new settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    conf = dict(self)
    conf.update(kwargs)
    return conf
```
