The problem lies in the `update` method of the `Settings` class. The method is designed to return a new instance of the `Settings` class with updated values from the provided `kwargs`. However, the existing implementation does not update the keys in the `kwargs` with new values. Instead, it creates a new dictionary `conf` and updates it with the `kwargs`.

The reason for the error is that the original values are not properly updated with the new values from `kwargs`, causing the tests to fail.

To fix the bug, the `update` method should directly update the existing dictionary with the new values from `kwargs`. The corrected implementation is provided below.

```python
class Settings(dict):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def update(self, **kwargs):
        """Returns new settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
        self.update(kwargs)  # Update the existing dictionary with new values
        return self  # Return the updated settings
```

With this corrected implementation, the `update` method will properly update the existing dictionary with the provided `kwargs` and return the updated `Settings`. This should resolve the issues and make the test cases pass.
