Potential error location: There's a bug in the update method of the Settings class. The update method is supposed to update the settings with the new values from kwargs, but it is instead returning a new instance of Settings with the combined values of the original settings and kwargs.

Reasons behind the bug: The update method is incorrectly instantiating a new Settings object instead of modifying the existing one.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Instead of creating a new Settings object, modify the original settings with the values from kwargs.
2. Return the modified settings object directly rather than creating a new instance.

Here's the corrected code for the update method of the Settings class:
```python
class Settings(dict):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def update(self, **kwargs):
        """Updates the settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
        self.update(kwargs)
        return self
```
By modifying the original settings and returning it directly, this corrected method eliminates the bug and should pass the provided test cases without errors.
