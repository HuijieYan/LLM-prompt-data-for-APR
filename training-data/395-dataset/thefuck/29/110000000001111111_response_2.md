The potential error in the `update` function is that it is trying to create a new `Settings` object by passing a dictionary to it, but it should be passing keyword arguments instead.

The bug occurs because the `update` method is trying to pass a dictionary to the `Settings` constructor instead of passing keyword arguments.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `update` function to unpack the `kwargs` and pass them as keyword arguments to the `Settings` constructor.

Here's the corrected code for the `update` function:

```python
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Returns new settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    conf = {**self, **kwargs}  # Unpack the kwargs and merge them with self
    return Settings(**conf)  # Pass the merged dictionary as keyword arguments
```

With this correction, the `update` function should work as expected, creating a new `Settings` object with updated values.
