The problem with the `update` function in the `Settings` class is that it is creating a new dictionary by updating the original dictionary with the provided keyword arguments. However, instead of updating the original dictionary, it creates a new one, which causes the tests to fail.

The expected behavior of the `update` function should be to update the original dictionary and return it with the modifications, essentially modifying the `self` object.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `update` function to directly update the dictionary `self` and then return it. This can be achieved using the `update` method of the dictionary class. The corrected code for the `update` function is as follows:

```python
class Settings(dict):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def update(self, **kwargs):
        """Updates settings with new values from `kwargs` and returns it."""
        self.update(kwargs)
        return self
```

By using the `update` method of the dictionary `self`, we are directly modifying the `self` dictionary with the provided keyword arguments. This will ensure that the original dictionary is updated as expected, and the tests should pass without any issues.
