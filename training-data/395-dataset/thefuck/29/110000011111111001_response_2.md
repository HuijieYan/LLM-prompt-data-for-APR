Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the `update` function. It is supposed to update the settings with new values from `kwargs`, but it is currently not updating the values correctly based on the error messages and expected values provided.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect implementation of the `update` function. The function is not correctly updating the existing settings with the new values provided in `kwargs`. This results in incorrect values being returned when the `update` function is called.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the `update` method of the dictionary to update the settings with new values from `kwargs`.
2. Ensure that the updated settings are returned in the correct format and type.

Here's the corrected code for the `update` function:

```python
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Returns new settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    conf = dict(self)
    conf.update(kwargs)
    return Settings(conf)
```

The fix involves using the `update` method of the dictionary to correctly update the settings based on the new values provided in `kwargs`. This should ensure that the updated settings are returned as expected.
