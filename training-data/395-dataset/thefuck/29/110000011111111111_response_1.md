The buggy function `update` is designed to update the existing settings with new values from `kwargs` and returns the new settings. However, the implementation seems to have a bug, which causes the returned settings to be incorrect. The issue lies in the `conf.update(kwargs)` line where it is mistakenly updating the new settings with the old settings as well. This leads to an incorrect merge of the new and old settings.

To fix this, a correct approach would be to simply update the existing settings with the new values from `kwargs` and return the updated settings without merging them with the existing ones. This can be achieved by using the `update` method of the existing settings object and then return the updated settings.

Here's the corrected code for the `update` function:

```python
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Returns new settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    updated_settings = dict(self)
    updated_settings.update(kwargs)
    return Settings(updated_settings)
```

With this correction, the function will correctly update the settings with the new values and return the updated settings object. This should address the issues raised in the provided test cases and error messages.
