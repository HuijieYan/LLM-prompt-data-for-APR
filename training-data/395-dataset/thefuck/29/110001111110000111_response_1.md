The error occurred due to the incorrect behavior of the `update` function in the `Settings` class. The `update` function is intended to return new settings with new values from `kwargs`, but the implementation is incorrect.

The potential error location lies in the following line of code within the `update` function:
```python
conf = dict(self)
```
This line attempts to create a dictionary from the current `Settings` object, which is not a valid operation.

To fix the bug, the corrected `update` function should update the existing settings with the values from `kwargs` and return a new `Settings` object with the updated values.

Here's the corrected code for the `update` function:

```python
class Settings:
    def __init__(self, settings):
        self.settings = settings

    def update(self, **kwargs):
        """Returns new settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
        new_settings = self.settings.copy()
        new_settings.update(kwargs)
        return Settings(new_settings)

# After the update to the `Settings` class, the test functions should work without any errors.
```
