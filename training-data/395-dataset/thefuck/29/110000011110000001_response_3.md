Potential bug: The `update` method in the `Settings` class is not correctly updating the settings with the new values from `kwargs`. It should update the existing settings with the new values, but it is currently creating a new dictionary and updating it with the new values.

Reasons behind the bug:
- The `update` method is creating a new `conf` dictionary using `dict(self)`, which essentially copies the keys and values from the `self` object to a new dictionary `conf`. This means that any changes to `conf` will not affect the original settings.
- Once the new `kwargs` are updated to `conf`, a new `Settings` object is created with these updated settings. However, the original settings remain unchanged, leading to unexpected behavior.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Instead of creating a new dictionary using `dict(self)`, directly update the `self` object with the new values from `kwargs`.
2. After updating the `self` object, there is no need to return a new `Settings` object. The method can simply return `None` or the updated `self` object.

Code for the corrected function:

```python
# Corrected update method
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Update the settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    self.update(kwargs)
```

By directly updating the `self` object with the new values from `kwargs`, the original settings will be correctly updated. There is no need to return a new `Settings` object.
