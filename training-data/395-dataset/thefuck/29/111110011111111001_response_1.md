The issue with the `update` method in the `Settings` class is that it updates the existing dictionary (`conf`) but then returns a new instance of `Settings` with the updated dictionary. This means the original settings are not modified, and a new settings object is returned instead of updating the existing one.

In the first test case, the assertion fails because the new settings object returned does not contain the updated values from `kwargs`.

To fix this issue, one approach is to modify the existing `self` dictionary in-place with the values from `kwargs` and then return the modified `self`. This way, the original settings are updated, and there is no need to create a new instance of `Settings` with the modified dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the `update` method:

```python
class Settings(dict):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def update(self, **kwargs):
        """Update existing settings with values from `kwargs`."""
        self.update(kwargs)
        return self
```

By using `self.update(kwargs)` instead of creating a new `conf` dictionary and updating it, we ensure that the original settings are modified in place and then returned. This should address the issues observed in the test cases and error messages provided.
