The error is occurring in the `update` function of the `Settings` class because it is returning a new instance of `Settings` with the original values, rather than updating the original instance itself. This is causing the test cases to fail because they expect the original settings to be updated rather than creating a new instance.

One possible approach to fixing this bug is to update the settings within the original instance of the `Settings` class, rather than creating a new instance.

Here's the corrected `update` function:

```python
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Updates the settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    self.update(kwargs)
```

This updated function will directly update the settings within the original instance and will resolve the bug.
