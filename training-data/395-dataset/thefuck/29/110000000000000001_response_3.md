Potential error location:
The issue is with the line `conf = dict(self)`. Here, the intention is to create a copy of the settings dictionary, but `dict(self)` will try to convert `self` object to a dictionary, which may not work as intended.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `dict(self)` call is not the correct way to create a copy of the dictionary. It is trying to create a dictionary from the object `self`, which is not the intended behavior.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
To create a copy of the settings dictionary, we can use the `copy` method or the dictionary constructor.

Corrected code:
```python
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Returns new settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    conf = self.copy()  # or conf = dict(self)
    conf.update(kwargs)
    return Settings(conf)
```
