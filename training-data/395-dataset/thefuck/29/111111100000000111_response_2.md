Potential error location: The issue seems to be in the `update` method of the `Settings` class. The method is supposed to update the settings with new values from `kwargs`, but it is creating a new `Settings` instance with the updated values instead of updating the current instance.

Reason for the bug: The `update` method is creating a new `Settings` instance instead of updating the current instance, which defeats the purpose of the method.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Modify the `update` method to update the current instance of `Settings` with the new values from `kwargs`.

Corrected code:
```python
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Updates the current settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    self.update(kwargs)
```
