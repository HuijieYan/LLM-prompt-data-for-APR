The potential error in the `update` function is the way it handles the update of the settings. It seems to create a new dictionary that copies the existing settings and then updates it with new values. However, this approach is incorrect because it will overwrite the existing values with the new values, instead of updating them.

The reason for the bug is that the `conf.update(kwargs)` call overwrites the existing values in `conf` with the new values in `kwargs`. This results in incorrect behavior when the new settings are used.

To fix the bug, a more appropriate approach would be to update the existing dictionary with the new values, and then return a new `Settings` object with the updated settings.

Here's the corrected `update` function:

```python
def update(self, **kwargs):
    """Returns new settings with new values from `kwargs`."""
    conf = dict(self)
    conf.update(kwargs)
    return Settings(conf)
```

This corrected code creates a new dictionary `conf` that replicates the existing settings, then updates it with the new values from `kwargs`. Finally, it returns a new `Settings` object with the updated settings.

With this correction, the test cases should pass without any assertion errors.
