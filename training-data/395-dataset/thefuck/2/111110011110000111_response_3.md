The error seems to be occurring because the Path class object is not being created properly within the get_all_executables function.

The get_all_executables function iterates over the items in the PATH environment variable, and for each item, it tries to create a Path object using `Path(path).iterdir()`. However, the test case seems to be failing due to incorrect creation of Path object.

To fix this, we should import the `Path` class from the `pathlib` module first, and then use it to create Path objects.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import os
from pathlib import Path  # Import the Path class from the pathlib module

# Corrected function using the above import
def get_all_executables():
    from thefuck.shells import shell

    def _safe(fn, fallback):
        try:
            return fn()
        except OSError:
            return fallback

    tf_alias = get_alias()
    tf_entry_points = ['thefuck', 'fuck']

    bins = [exe.name.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else exe.name
            for path in os.environ.get('PATH', '').split(':')
            for exe in _safe(lambda: list(Path(path).iterdir()), [])
            if not _safe(exe.is_dir, True)
            and exe.name not in tf_entry_points]
    aliases = [alias.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else alias
               for alias in shell.get_aliases() if alias != tf_alias]

    return bins + aliases
```
With this correction, the issue with creating the Path object should be resolved, and the test case should work as expected.
