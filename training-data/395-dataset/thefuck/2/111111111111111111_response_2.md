The error seems to be related to the call to the `Path` class mock. It appears that the `Path` object from the `thefuck.utils` module is being incorrectly used which results in an assertion error since the expected calls are not found in the call list.

The issue with the `get_all_executables` function is that it is defining another `_safe` function within itself, which results in shadowing the previous `_safe` function defined at the module level. The nested `_safe` function is essentially overwriting the original `_safe` function and causing inconsistencies in calls and mocks.

To fix this issue, the nested `_safe` function should be removed from the `get_all_executables` function, and the imports for the required modules (`os`, `six`, etc.) should be added for clarity.

Here's the corrected implementation of the `get_all_executables` function:

```python
import os
import six
from thefuck.shells import shell
from pathlib import Path

def memoize(fn):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def get_alias():
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def _safe(fn, fallback):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

@memoize
def get_all_executables():
    tf_alias = get_alias()
    tf_entry_points = ['thefuck', 'fuck']
    
    bins = [exe.name.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else exe.name
            for path in os.environ.get('PATH', '').split(':')
            for exe in _safe(lambda: list(Path(path).iterdir()), [])
            if not _safe(exe.is_dir, True)
            and exe.name not in tf_entry_points]
    aliases = [alias.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else alias
               for alias in shell.get_aliases() if alias != tf_alias]

    return bins + aliases
```
