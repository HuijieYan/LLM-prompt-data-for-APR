The error occurred at the line `Path_mock.assert_has_calls([call(p) for p in path.split(pathsep)], True)` in the test function. This means that the `mock_calls` for the `Path` object does not contain the expected calls for `Path` with the given arguments and this is likely due to the bugged `get_all_executables` function not being implemented correctly.

The bug seems to stem from the discrepancy in the function call and the representations of the mock calls. The `mock_calls` attribute is filled with unexpected and incomplete calls, implying that either the function `get_all_executables` or the function used by this function has an implementation error.

To fix this issue, the functions involved in creating mock calls need to be addressed. Specifically, verifying whether `get_all_executables` and its sub-functions are working as expected by using relevant print statements or possibly using a Python debugger. Debugging tools such as `pdb` can also be useful for step-by-step inspection.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_2/thefuck/utils.py

import os

# relative function's signature in this file
def memoize(fn):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def get_alias():
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def _safe(fn, fallback):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# this is the corrected function
def get_all_executables():
    from thefuck.shells import shell
    from pathlib import Path
    
    def _safe(fn, fallback):
        try:
            return fn()
        except OSError:
            return fallback
    
    tf_alias = get_alias()
    tf_entry_points = ['thefuck', 'fuck']

    bins = [exe.name for path in os.environ.get('PATH', '').split(os.pathsep)
            for exe in _safe(lambda: list(Path(path).iterdir()), [])
            if not _safe(exe.is_dir, True)
            and exe.name not in tf_entry_points]
    aliases = [alias for alias in shell.get_aliases() if alias != tf_alias]

    return bins + aliases
```
