The error occurs in the `test_get_all_executables_pathsep` test case, specifically at the line where `Path_mock.assert_has_calls` is being called with the `path.split(pathsep)` as an argument. The error message indicates that the `Path` object is being called with what seems to be partially split 'C' values and other irrelevant calls.

The issue seems to be with the calculation of the split of the `path` string. 

The `buggy` function `get_all_executables` has a piece of code: 
```
for p in path.split(pathsep)
```
, where `pathsep` is considered as either `':'` or `';'`. However, this split logic seems to be incorrect and resulting in unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, we can implement a different splitting mechanism. We need to correctly split the `path` string based on the `pathsep` value and then call the `Path` object with the separated values.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_all_executables` function:

```python
@memoize
def get_all_executables():
    from thefuck.shells import shell

    def _safe(fn, fallback):
        try:
            return fn()
        except OSError:
            return fallback

    tf_alias = get_alias()
    tf_entry_points = ['thefuck', 'fuck']

    bins = [exe.name.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else exe.name
            for path in os.environ.get('PATH', '').split(pathsep)  # Use pathsep for splitting instead of a hardcoded ':'
            for exe in _safe(lambda: list(Path(path).iterdir()), [])
            if not _safe(exe.is_dir, True)
            and exe.name not in tf_entry_points]
    aliases = [alias.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else alias
               for alias in shell.get_aliases() if alias != tf_alias]

    return bins + aliases
```

By correctly splitting the `path` based on the `pathsep` value, the issue should be resolved. Now, the `get_all_executables` function should correctly iterate over the split paths and return the expected result for further processing.
