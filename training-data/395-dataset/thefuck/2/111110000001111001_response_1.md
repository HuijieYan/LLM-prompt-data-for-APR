The error here seems to be related to the `@memoize` decorator, which is not defined in the provided code. It seems like the intention is to memoize the results of the `get_all_executables` function, but the memoization logic is missing. 

One possible approach to fixing this bug would be to implement memoization for the `get_all_executables` function. This can be done using a simple dictionary to store the results of previous calls to the function.

Here is the corrected function with the memoization logic:

```python
# Corrected function
def memoize(func):
    memo = {}
    def wrapper(*args):
        if args not in memo:
            memo[args] = func(*args)
        return memo[args]
    return wrapper

@memoize
def get_all_executables():
    from thefuck.shells import shell
    import os
    import six
    from pathlib import Path

    def _safe(fn, fallback):
        try:
            return fn()
        except OSError:
            return fallback

    def get_alias():
        # This function seems to be missing from the provided code, so I assume it is defined elsewhere
        pass
      
    tf_alias = get_alias()
    tf_entry_points = ['thefuck', 'fuck']

    bins = [exe.name.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else exe.name
            for path in os.environ.get('PATH', '').split(':')
            for exe in _safe(lambda: list(Path(path).iterdir()), [])
            if not _safe(exe.is_dir, True)
            and exe.name not in tf_entry_points]
    aliases = [alias.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else alias
               for alias in shell.get_aliases() if alias != tf_alias]

    return bins + aliases
```

In the corrected code, I have implemented a simple memoization using a dictionary to store the results of previous function calls. I have also added missing import statements for `os`, `six`, and `Path` to make the code runnable. Additionally, I added a placeholder for the `get_alias` function, assuming it is defined elsewhere.
