The error message, in this case, indicates that the method `Path_mock.assert_has_calls` is failing. It looks like the assertion is expecting `Path_mock` to have specific calls, but it's not receiving the expected calls. The problem is likely related to the behavior of the method `Path.mock_assert_calls`.

The potential error location is in the generation of `Path` objects from the `path` string. There might be an issue with how the `path` is being split or processed, resulting in different calls than the ones expected by the assertion.

The bug occurs due to the incorrect split of the `path` string, which leads to the unexpected calls in the `Path` mock. The `path` is split using both "backslash" and "semicolon" as delimiters, and this results in unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `path` is split correctly and that the resulting calls for `Path` are as expected.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import os
from pathlib import Path  # import Path from pathlib

# Define the get_all_executables method
def get_all_executables():
    def _safe(fn, fallback):
        try:
            return fn()
        except OSError:
            return fallback

    tf_alias = get_alias()  # Assuming get_alias is defined and available
    tf_entry_points = ['thefuck', 'fuck']

    bins = [exe.name.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else exe.name
            for path in os.environ.get('PATH', '').split(os.pathsep)  # Use os.pathsep to split the path
            for exe in _safe(lambda: list(Path(path).iterdir()), [])  # Use Path to create Path objects
            if not _safe(exe.is_dir, True)
            and exe.name not in tf_entry_points]
    aliases = [alias.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else alias
               for alias in shell.get_aliases() if alias != tf_alias]

    return bins + aliases
```

In this correction, the `os.pathsep` is used to split the `PATH`, and the `Path` object is created as part of the list comprehension. This should address the bug and provide the expected behavior for the assertion.
