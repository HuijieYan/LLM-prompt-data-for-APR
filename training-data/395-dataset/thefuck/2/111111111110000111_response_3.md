The error message from the test function indicates an AssertionError, specifically that the 'Path' doesn't contain all of the expected calls in its call list. This suggests that the 'Path' is not being called with the expected arguments, leading to the failure of the test.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the usage of the '_safe' method to handle the iteration over the path. It seems that the '_safe' method is not correctly handling the path extraction and iteration, leading to an incorrect sequence of function calls. This is likely causing the 'Path' calls to not match the expected calls.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the '_safe' method is being used inappropriately to handle path iteration, which is leading to unexpected function call sequences and eventually causing the mock 'Path' calls to mismatch.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to refactor the '_safe' method to handle the path extraction and iteration more accurately, ensuring that the 'Path' calls match the expected calls in the test function. Additionally, modifying the way the path extraction is handled in the 'get_all_executables' function could help to resolve the issue.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from thefuck.shells import shell
from collections import Iterable

@memoize
def get_all_executables():
    def safe(fn, fallback):
        try:
            return fn()
        except OSError:
            return fallback

    tf_alias = get_alias()
    tf_entry_points = ['thefuck', 'fuck']

    bins = []
    for path in os.environ.get('PATH', '').split(':'):
        exec_path = safe(lambda: list(Path(path).iterdir()), [])
        if isinstance(exec_path, Iterable):
            for exe in exec_path:
                if not safe(exe.is_dir, True) and exe.name not in tf_entry_points:
                    if six.PY2:
                        bins.append(exe.name.decode('utf8'))
                    else:
                        bins.append(exe.name)
    aliases = [alias.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else alias for alias in shell.get_aliases() if alias != tf_alias]

    return bins + aliases
```
