Potential Error Location: The error likely occurs in the get_all_executables() function, where the issue arises during the processing of the path and pathsep values to construct the Path objects.

Reasons for Occurrence of the Bug: The error seems to be related to the incorrect splitting of the path using pathsep, leading to unexpected behavior during the creation of Path objects in the get_all_executables() function.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: The splitting of the path using the provided pathsep needs to be reviewed, as well as the subsequent processing of the paths to create the Path objects. Additionally, the assertion logic within the test function might need adjustment to accurately reflect the expected call list for the Path objects.

```python
# Buggy function source code

def get_all_executables():
    from thefuck.shells import shell
    tf_alias = get_alias()
    tf_entry_points = ['thefuck', 'fuck']
    
    bins = [exe.name.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else exe.name
            for path in os.environ.get('PATH', '').split(':')
            for exe in _safe(lambda: list(Path(path).iterdir()) if os.path.exists(path) else [], [])
            if not _safe(lambda: exe.is_dir(), True)
            and exe.name not in tf_entry_points]
    aliases = [alias.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else alias
                for alias in shell.get_aliases() if alias != tf_alias]
    return bins + aliases
