1. The test case is attempting to use the `assert_has_calls` method to verify that the `Path` has been called with the specified calls. However, it appears that the calls are not being generated correctly, leading to the assertion failure.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the list comprehension that attempts to construct calls to the `Path` mock.

3. The bug occurs because the `get_all_executables` function is not correctly constructing the `Path` calls. It seems that the splitting of the `path` variable might be incorrect, leading to fewer than expected `Path` calls being constructed.

4. Possible approaches to fixing the bug include:
   - Examining the `path` variable and the use of `pathsep` to ensure that the correct splitting is being performed.
   - Verifying that the calls to `Path` are being generated correctly within the list comprehension.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from thefuck.shells import shell
from pathlib import Path
import os
import six

def memoize(fn):
    memo = {}
    def helper(*args):
        if args not in memo:
            memo[args] = fn(*args)
        return memo[args]
    return helper

def get_alias():
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def _safe(fn, fallback):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

@memoize
def get_all_executables():
    def _safe(fn, fallback):
        try:
            return fn()
        except OSError:
            return fallback

    tf_alias = get_alias()
    tf_entry_points = ['thefuck', 'fuck']

    # Retrieve the environment PATH and split it based on the path separator
    bins = [exe.name.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else exe.name
            for path in os.environ.get('PATH', '').split(os.pathsep)
            for exe in _safe(lambda: list(Path(path).iterdir()), [])
            if not _safe(exe.is_dir, True)
            and exe.name not in tf_entry_points]
    aliases = [alias.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else alias
               for alias in shell.get_aliases() if alias != tf_alias]

    return bins + aliases
```
