The error message indicates that the Path_mock object is not having the correct calls expected from it. This could be due to the `Path` object not being initialized properly in the `get_all_executables` function, leading to incorrect calls further down the line.

The potential error location within the `get_all_executables` function is the conversion of `Path(path).iterdir()` into a list comprehension.

The cause of the bug is that the `Path` object is not being correctly instantiated within the function, leading to incorrect calls when the function is being tested.

To fix the bug, the `pathlib` library needs to be imported and used to create `Path` objects for `path`:

```python
import os
from pathlib import Path

def get_all_executables():
    from thefuck.shells import shell

    def _safe(fn, fallback):
        try:
            return fn()
        except OSError:
            return fallback

    tf_alias = get_alias()
    tf_entry_points = ['thefuck', 'fuck']

    bins = [exe.name.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else exe.name
            for path in os.environ.get('PATH', '').split(':')
            for exe in _safe(lambda: list(Path(path).iterdir()), [])
            if not _safe(exe.is_dir, True)
            and exe.name not in tf_entry_points]
    aliases = [alias.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else alias
               for alias in shell.get_aliases() if alias != tf_alias]

    return bins + aliases
```

This should make sure the `Path` object is initialized correctly and the function should work as intended.
