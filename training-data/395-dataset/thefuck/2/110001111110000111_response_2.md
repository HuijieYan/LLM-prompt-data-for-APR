Potential Error Location: The bug is likely occurring in the way the path is being split into different components.

Reasons: The error message from the test case indicates that the 'Path' mock does not contain all the expected calls but has some unexpected calls. This suggests that the splitting of the path using the provided path separator is not working as expected.

Possible Approaches:
1. Check if the path splitting code correctly handles paths with different separators, such as '/' and '\\', and that it is consistent across different operating systems.
2. Ensure that the path separators are properly handled, preventing any unintended splits or errors.
3. It's also important to validate the format of the path and path separators to avoid issues with different path formats (e.g., Windows-style paths with backslashes).

Corrected Code:
```python
@memoize
def get_all_executables():
    from thefuck.shells import shell
    
    def _safe(fn, fallback):
        try:
            return fn()
        except OSError:
            return fallback
    
    tf_alias = get_alias()
    tf_entry_points = ['thefuck', 'fuck']
    
    path_separator = os.pathsep  # Obtain the path separator
    bins = [exe.name.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else exe.name
            for path in os.environ.get('PATH', '').split(path_separator)  # Use os.pathsep to split the path
            for exe in _safe(lambda: list(Path(path).iterdir()), [])
            if not _safe(exe.is_dir, True)
            and exe.name not in tf_entry_points]
    aliases = [alias.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else alias
               for alias in shell.get_aliases() if alias != tf_alias]
    
    return bins + aliases
```
