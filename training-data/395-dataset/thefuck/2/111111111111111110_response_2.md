The error message does not point to a clear error in the code but it seems there is an issue reading the calls made. The code provided is a mix of python code with markdown comments and test cases. As the naming implies, the function `get_all_executables` is meant to return all executables from the environment. 

However, it seems that the function makes use of methods like `_safe` to handle exceptions while obtaining executables from the PATH environment variable. Also, the function refers to unknown types such as `shells` and `six`, which are missing from the current implementation. 

Additionally, it uses a decorator memoize for caching the results of the function, but the implementation of `memoize` is missing. Finally, it does not import necessary modules like `os`, `Path`, etc.

It is important to correct these issues to ensure that the function works as expected.

Here's the corrected `get_all_executables` function:

```python
import os
from pathlib import Path

def get_alias():
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def _safe(fn, fallback):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# this is the corrected function
def get_all_executables():
    def _safe(fn, fallback):
        try:
            return fn()
        except OSError:
            return fallback

    tf_alias = get_alias()
    tf_entry_points = ['thefuck', 'fuck']

    bins = [exe.name.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else exe.name
            for path in os.environ.get('PATH', '').split(':')
            for exe in _safe(lambda: list(Path(path).iterdir()), [])
            if not _safe(exe.is_dir, True)
            and exe.name not in tf_entry_points]

    # This part is still unclear, as the `shell` and `six` objects are missing
    aliases = [alias.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else alias
               for alias in shell.get_aliases() if alias != tf_alias]

    return bins + aliases
```

The test function is also missing some necessary calls to the unit test framework, but it seems to be mostly correct otherwise. You can further validate the correctness of the code by running the provided test cases and adjusting them as needed.
