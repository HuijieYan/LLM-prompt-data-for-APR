The test case defines the path and pathsep as input parameters and then proceeds to call the `get_all_executables` function. The error message is related to the `Path_mock.assert_has_calls` check, indicating that the expected calls are not present in the call list.

The potential error in the `get_all_executables` function is within the list comprehension where it splits the path using the provided pathsep. This operation might be causing an unexpected result, leading to the failure in the test case.

The reason behind the bug could be the improper handling of the path and pathsep split operation, which does not match the expected behavior.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to ensure that the path is split correctly using the provided pathsep and that the resulting paths are handled appropriately. Additionally, verifying the usage of `Path` for file path operations and ensuring the correct representation of the paths is crucial.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
from thefuck.shells import shell
from pathlib import Path
import os
import six

def get_all_executables():
    tf_alias = get_alias()
    tf_entry_points = ['thefuck', 'fuck']

    def _safe(fn, fallback):
        try:
            return fn()
        except OSError:
            return fallback

    # Split the path using the provided pathsep
    pathsep = os.pathsep
    bins = [exe.name.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else exe.name
            for path in os.environ.get('PATH', '').split(pathsep)
            for exe in _safe(lambda: list(Path(path).iterdir()), [])
            if not _safe(exe.is_dir, True)
            and exe.name not in tf_entry_points]
  
    aliases = [alias.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else alias
               for alias in shell.get_aliases() if alias != tf_alias]

    return bins + aliases
```
