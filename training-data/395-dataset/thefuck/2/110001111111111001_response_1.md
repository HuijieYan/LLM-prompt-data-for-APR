## Issue Identification
The issue arises from the `path.split(pathsep)` function in the test function `test_get_all_executables_pathsep`. The error message indicates that instead of parsing the path correctly, the split operation breaks the string into smaller segments, leading to an assertion failure. This is indicative of a potential bug within the `get_all_executables` function.

## Bug Analysis
The bug arises due to incorrect processing of path separators, which results in the split operation not functioning as expected. This causes the subsequent operations to fail, leading to the assertion error in the test case.

## Reasons behind the Bug
The primary reason behind the bug is the incorrect handling of path separators within the `get_all_executables` function, which leads to incorrect path processing and causes the subsequent test cases to fail.

## Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug
1. Correctly handle the path separator based on the operating system to ensure consistent path processing.
2. Adjust the path processing method to consider different path separators used on different operating systems.
3. Ensure that the test cases and the function maintain consistent path processing to avoid issues related to path separation.

## Corrected Code
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_2/thefuck/utils.py

import os
import six
from pathlib import Path
from thefuck.shells import shell

def memoize(fn):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def get_alias():
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def _safe(fn, fallback):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

@memoize
def get_all_executables():
    tf_alias = get_alias()
    tf_entry_points = ['thefuck', 'fuck']

    # Corrected path separator processing
    path_separator = os.pathsep
    if os.name == 'nt':
        path_separator = ';'

    bins = [exe.name.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else exe.name
            for path in os.environ.get('PATH', '').split(path_separator)
            for exe in _safe(lambda: list(Path(path).iterdir()), [])
            if not _safe(exe.is_dir, True)
            and exe.name not in tf_entry_points]
    aliases = [alias.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else alias
               for alias in shell.get_aliases() if alias != tf_alias]

    return bins + aliases
```

With the corrected code, the path separator is determined based on the operating system, ensuring that the path processing is consistent across different environments. This should resolve the path separation issue and address the assertion error in the test case.
