The error message mentioned that the 'Path' mock object was not receiving the expected calls. This implies that the get_all_executables() function is not generating the expected call sequence for the 'Path' mock.

Upon analyzing the get_all_executables() function, the potential error location is in the 'bins' and 'aliases' list comprehensions, specifically when it interacts with the file system. The use of _safe() function and iteration over paths in the system environment 'PATH' variable could lead to inconsistencies in generating the expected call sequence for the 'Path' mock.

The bug occurs due to the interaction with the file system and reliance on OS-specific semantics. This can result in unexpected behavior when splitting paths or iterating over them.

To fix the bug, the usage of the 'Path' mock should be made more robust. This can be achieved by ensuring that the 'Path' mock receives the necessary calls according to the defined paths and path separators. Also, handling the interaction with the file system in a consistent and OS-independent manner can help to avoid discrepancies and improve testability.

Below is the corrected code for the get_all_executables() function:

```python
@memoize
def get_all_executables():
    from thefuck.shells import shell
    import os

    def _safe(fn, fallback):
        try:
            return fn()
        except OSError:
            return fallback

    tf_alias = get_alias()
    tf_entry_points = ['thefuck', 'fuck']

    bins = [os.path.basename(str(exe)) for path in os.environ.get('PATH', '').split(':')
            for exe in _safe(lambda: list(os.scandir(path)), [])
            if exe.is_file() and exe.name not in tf_entry_points]
    aliases = [alias for alias in shell.get_aliases() if alias != tf_alias]

    return bins + aliases
```

In the corrected code:
1. The 'os' module is used to handle operations related to the file system, ensuring consistency across different operating systems.
2. The 'os.path.basename' function is used to get the base name of the executable from the path, ensuring consistent behavior.
3. 'os.scandir' is used to iterate over paths in the system environment 'PATH' variable, providing a consistent and OS-independent approach for file system interaction.
