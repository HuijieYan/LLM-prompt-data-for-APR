The test case is checking how the `get_all_executables()` function interacts with the `Path` module from `thefuck.utils`. The error in the test function's output suggests that the `Path` mock was not called with the expected parameters. This indicates that the `get_all_executables()` function is not creating the `Path` instances correctly.

Upon analyzing the `get_all_executables()` function, it seems that there is a discrepancy in the handling of path separators. The code doesn't consider the path separator, which leads to incorrect `Path` instances while splitting the `os.environ.get('PATH', '')` string.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to split the `PATH` environment variable according to the correct path separator for the system. It also requires updating calls to the `Path` constructor to use the split result with the correct path components.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
import os
from pathlib import Path
import six
from thefuck.shells import shell

@memoize
def get_all_executables():
    def _safe(fn, fallback):
        try:
            return fn()
        except OSError:
            return fallback

    tf_alias = get_alias()
    tf_entry_points = ['thefuck', 'fuck']
    path_separator = os.pathsep  # Get the correct path separator

    bins = [exe.name.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else exe.name
            for path in os.environ.get('PATH', '').split(path_separator)  # Use the correct path separator
            for exe in _safe(lambda: list(Path(path).iterdir()), [])
            if not _safe(exe.is_dir, True)
            and exe.name not in tf_entry_points]
    aliases = [alias.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else alias
               for alias in shell.get_aliases() if alias != tf_alias]

    return bins + aliases
```
