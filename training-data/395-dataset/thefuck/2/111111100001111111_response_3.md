The potential error location within the problematic function is where we are defining `bins` and `aliases`. The issue seems to be related to the usage of the `Path` object and `os` library, which are not imported in the function.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the necessary libraries and objects are not imported into the function scope. The `Path` and `os` libraries are required for the function to work correctly, but they are not imported at the beginning of the function.

To fix the bug, we need to import the `Path` and `os` libraries at the beginning of the function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import os
from pathlib import Path

@memoize
def get_all_executables():
    from thefuck.shells import shell

    def _safe(fn, fallback):
        try:
            return fn()
        except OSError:
            return fallback

    tf_alias = get_alias()
    tf_entry_points = ['thefuck', 'fuck']

    bins = [exe.name.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else exe.name
            for path in os.environ.get('PATH', '').split(':')
            for exe in _safe(lambda: list(Path(path).iterdir()), [])
            if not _safe(exe.is_dir, True)
            and exe.name not in tf_entry_points]
    aliases = [alias.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else alias
               for alias in shell.get_aliases() if alias != tf_alias]

    return bins + aliases
```
