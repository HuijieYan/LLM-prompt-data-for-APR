The potential error in the given function is that the `@memoize` decorator is used, but it is not defined in the code provided. This means the function is attempting to use a decorator that is not imported or defined within the code snippet.

The reason behind the occurrence of this bug is that the `@memoize` decorator is not available in the code provided. It is likely that the `@memoize` decorator is meant to cache the results of the `get_all_executables` function to improve performance.

One possible approach for fixing this bug is to define the `@memoize` decorator or import it from an existing library. The `@memoize` decorator can be used to prevent unnecessary re-computation of the function's result by caching the result based on its input parameters.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from functools import lru_cache

# Define the memoize decorator
def memoize(func):
    return lru_cache(maxsize=None)(func)

# Corrected function
@memoize
def get_all_executables():
    from thefuck.shells import shell
    from pathlib import Path
    import os
    import six

    def _safe(fn, fallback):
        try:
            return fn()
        except OSError:
            return fallback

    tf_alias = get_alias()
    tf_entry_points = ['thefuck', 'fuck']

    bins = [exe.name.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else exe.name
            for path in os.environ.get('PATH', '').split(':')
            for exe in _safe(lambda: list(Path(path).iterdir()), [])
            if not _safe(exe.is_dir, True)
            and exe.name not in tf_entry_points]
    aliases = [alias.decode('utf8') if six.PY2 else alias
               for alias in shell.get_aliases() if alias != tf_alias]

    return bins + aliases
```
