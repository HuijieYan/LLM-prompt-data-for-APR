The test case `test_get_all_executables_pathsep` is designed to test the behavior of the `get_all_executables` function by mocking the `Path` object and asserting the calls made to it with certain paths. The error message indicates that the calls to the mocked `Path` object within the `get_all_executables` function do not match the expected calls.

The potential error location lies in the `get_all_executables` function, specifically in the list comprehension that iterates over the path environment variable and creates a list of executable binaries.

The bug in the 'get_all_executables' function is likely due to incorrect iteration over the path environment variable and the subsequent creation of the lists for `bins` and `aliases`. The current implementation seems to be splitting the path with the path separator and then constructing a list of executables where the base name of the executable is extracted from each path. However, the current implementation does not handle the Windows path format correctly, leading to the mismatch in expected and actual calls to the `Path` object.

To fix the bug, the 'get_all_executables' function should handle the correct extraction of executable paths and names from the environment variable considering the platform-specific path separator and formatting.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_all_executables`' function:

```python
from pathlib import Path
import os

@memoize
def get_all_executables():
    from thefuck.shells import shell

    tf_alias = get_alias()
    tf_entry_points = ['thefuck', 'fuck']

    bins = [exe.name if hasattr(exe, 'name') else str(exe.parts[-1])  # Handle both Path and string by checking available attributes
            for path in os.environ.get('PATH', '').split(os.pathsep)
            for exe in _safe(lambda: list(Path(path).iterdir()), [])
            if not _safe(exe.is_dir, True) and exe.name not in tf_entry_points]
    aliases = [alias for alias in shell.get_aliases() if alias != tf_alias]

    return bins + aliases
```
