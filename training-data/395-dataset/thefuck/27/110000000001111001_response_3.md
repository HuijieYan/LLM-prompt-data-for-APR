The buggy function is supposed to take a command and settings as input and return a new command. It is currently supposed to add "http://" before the provided command's URL. However, the existing implementation extracts the URL by slicing command.script, which may not always capture the full URL if there are different prefixes (e.g., "open", "xdg-open", "gnome-open", etc.).

The bug occurs because the function assumes that the URL always starts at index 5 of the command.script, which is not always the case.

To fix this bug, a better approach would be to split the command.script by spaces and take the second part as the URL. This way, the function can handle different prefixes (e.g., "open", "xdg-open", "gnome-open", etc.) correctly.

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    parts = command.script.split()
    if len(parts) > 1:
        return 'open http://' + parts[1]
    else:
        return ''  # Handle invalid commands gracefully
```

With this fix, the function should be able to correctly extract and add "http://" before the URL in the command.script, supporting different prefixes and ensuring the full URL is captured.
