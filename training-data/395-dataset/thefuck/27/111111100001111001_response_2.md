The buggy function `get_new_command` takes a command and settings as input and returns a modified command. It seems to be extracting the URL from the input command and appending it with 'open http://'.

The error seems to be with the way the script URL is being accessed. It's using a hardcoded index to retrieve the URL, which might lead to incorrect results for different inputs.

To fix the bug, we can split the `command.script` string to get the URL part after 'open'.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    open_index = command.script.index('open ') + len('open ')
    return 'open http://' + command.script[open_index:]
```
