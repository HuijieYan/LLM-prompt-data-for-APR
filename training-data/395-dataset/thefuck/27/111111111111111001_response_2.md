The error occurs because the function `get_new_command` is not handling the cases where the input script starts with "xdg-open", "gnome-open", or "kde-open" correctly. The function is assuming that the script always starts with "open", which is not the case in these scenarios.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to check for the presence of "open" at the beginning of the script. If "open" is present, it should use the substring starting from index 5. Otherwise, it should construct the new command by inserting "http://" before the provided script.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if command.script.startswith('open'):
        return 'open http://' + command.script[5:]
    elif command.script.startswith('xdg-open'):
        return 'xdg-open http://' + command.script[len('xdg-open'):]
    elif command.script.startswith('gnome-open'):
        return 'gnome-open http://' + command.script[len('gnome-open'):]
    elif command.script.startswith('kde-open'):
        return 'kde-open http://' + command.script[len('kde-open'):]
    else:
        return 'open http://' + command.script
```

This corrected code properly handles cases where the input script may start with "xdg-open", "gnome-open", or "kde-open", and constructs the new command accordingly.
