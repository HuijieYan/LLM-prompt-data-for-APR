The buggy function is `get_new_command(command, settings)`. It appends 'open http://' to the given command and then takes a substring starting from the 5th character. However, this approach is incorrect, causing the function to return unexpected results.

The error message from the test function shows that the actual output is incorrect compared to the expected output. This is likely caused by the string slicing operation in the `get_new_command` function.

The root cause of the bug is the incorrect index used for slicing the command string. The function incorrectly assumes that the URL starts from the 5th character of the command script, resulting in unexpected outputs.

To fix the bug, we need to identify the correct index position where the URL starts within the command's script. We can achieve this by checking the index of the space character (' ') within the string and then adjusting it appropriately to match the position of the URL.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    url_start = command.script.find('open') + 5  # Find the position of 'open' and add 5 to get the starting index of the URL
    return 'open http://' + command.script[url_start:]
```

With this corrected code, the function will correctly identify the starting index for the URL within the command's script and format the new command accordingly. This should resolve the bug and produce the expected results.
