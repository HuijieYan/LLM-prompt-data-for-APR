Potential error location: The buggy function returns the new command by slicing the input command's script at position 5. This approach may lead to incorrect results if the input script changes.

Reasons for the occurrence of the bug:
1. The current implementation assumes that the input command script always begins with "open ", and this may not always be the case.
2. Relying on the specific position (index 5) of the characters in the script may cause issues when the script format changes.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use string manipulation methods to extract the URL or domain from the command script.
2. Check if the script starts with "open " before extracting the URL or domain.

Corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if command.script.startswith('open '):
        return 'open ' + command.script[5:]
    else:
        return command.script
```
