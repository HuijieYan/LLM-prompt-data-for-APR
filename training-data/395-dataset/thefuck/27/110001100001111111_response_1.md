Potential error location: The buggy function returns a URL in the format 'open http://foo.com' instead of constructing a URL in the format 'http://foo.com'.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The buggy function incorrectly adds 'open' to the URL, resulting in the returned command being invalid.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the function to construct the URL without the 'open' keyword.
2. Use string manipulation methods to extract the domain from the input command and construct the URL accordingly.

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    url = command.script.split(' ')[-1]
    return f'http://{url}'
```
