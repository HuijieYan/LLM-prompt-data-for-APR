The buggy function `get_new_command` concatenates `'open http://'` with a portion of the input `command.script`. However, the function uses a hardcoded index of 5 to extract the substring from `command.script`. This results in the incorrect extraction of the URL.

The bug occurs because the function assumes that the string "open " will always be at the beginning of the `command.script`. This assumption causes the index-based slicing to be incorrect when the string "open " is not at the beginning of the `command.script`.

To fix the bug, the function should check for the presence of the string "open " at the beginning of `command.script` and then perform the slicing operation accordingly. Additionally, the function should handle cases where "open " is not present at the beginning of the script, returning an appropriate default value or raising an exception.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if command.script.startswith('open '):
        return 'open http://' + command.script[5:]
    else:
        # Handle the case where "open " is not at the beginning
        # Return a default value, or raise an exception as deemed appropriate
        return None  # replace 'None' with a default value or exception as needed
```

With this correction, the function will appropriately handle cases where the input script does not start with "open ", thus preventing the slicing index issue and resolving the bug.
