The bug in the function `get_new_command` is that it is trying to concatenate the command string 'open' with the command.script without verifying that the command string starts with the 'open' keyword. This leads to incorrect generation of the new command.

The reason for the assertion error in the test cases is that the function is not extracting the correct URL from the input command.script.

To fix this bug, the function needs to first check if the command starts with 'open' before performing the concatenation.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if command.script.startswith('open '):
        return 'open http://' + command.script[5:]
    else:
        return command.script
```

With this fix, the function will only add 'http://' to the script if it starts with 'open', and it will return the original script if it doesn't start with 'open'.
