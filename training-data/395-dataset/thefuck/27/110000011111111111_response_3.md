The issue with the `get_new_command` function is that it is trying to extract the domain suffix (e.g., .com, .org, .io) from the input command string and append it to 'http://'. A fixed implementation of the function should correctly extract the domain suffix and construct the new command.

The reason for the bug is that the function is using a fixed index (5) to extract the domain suffix from the input command script. This approach is not robust because the domain suffix can vary in length.

To fix this bug, we need to identify the position of the top-level domain suffix and then construct the new command by appending it to 'http://'.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    domain_suffix = command.script.split('.')[-1]  # Extract the domain suffix
    return f'open http://{command.script.split(" ")[-1]}.{domain_suffix}'
```

This code uses the `split` method to split the input command script and extract the domain suffix. It then constructs the new command by appending the domain suffix to 'http://'. This approach is more robust and should handle different domain suffix lengths correctly.
