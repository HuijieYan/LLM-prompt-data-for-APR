Potential error location: command.script[5:]

Reasons for the bug: The bug occurs because the function assumes that the input command always starts with 'http://', which may not always be the case.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We can modify the function to dynamically check for the presence of 'http://' at the beginning of the input command, and then construct the new command accordingly.

Corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if command.script.startswith('http://'):
        return command.script
    else:
        return 'open http://' + command.script
```
