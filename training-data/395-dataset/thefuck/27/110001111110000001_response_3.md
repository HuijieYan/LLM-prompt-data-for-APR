The error occurs in the function `get_new_command`. The function is supposed to modify the input `command` by prepending `'http://'` to the portion of the original command script starting from the 5th character onwards.  

The error message is due to the fact that the slicing operation `command.script[5:]` is not correctly extracting the substring from the 5th character onwards. Instead, the current implementation appends the prefix `'http://'` to the entire command script.

To fix the bug, the slicing operation should be adjusted to extract the substring correctly based on the instruction's requirements. The corrected slicing operation should exclude the first 5 characters from the original command script and then prepend the `'http://'` prefix.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return f"{command.script[:5]}http://{command.script[5:]}"
```
