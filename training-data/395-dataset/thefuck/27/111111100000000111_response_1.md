Potential error location: The error likely occurs in the line `command.script[5:]` as it is trying to access the 5th character of the `command.script`, which may not exist or may not be the intended behavior.

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs because the function is trying to access a specific substring of the `command.script` without first checking if it exists or verifying its length.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We need to check if the `command.script` contains at least 5 characters before attempting to access the substring.

Corrected code:
```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if len(command.script) > 5:
        return 'open http://' + command.script[5:]
    else:
        return 'open http://' + command.script
```
