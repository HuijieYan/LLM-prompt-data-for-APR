The buggy function `get_new_command` attempts to extract the URL from the command script and form a new command. However, it uses a fixed index to retrieve the URL, which can lead to errors if the input command changes.

To fix this bug, we can use the `split` function to split the command script on spaces and then take the second element as the URL. We will then format the new command string using this URL.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    parts = command.script.split()
    return 'open http://' + parts[1]
```
