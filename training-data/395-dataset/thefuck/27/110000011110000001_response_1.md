The error occurs because the 'get_new_command' function is incorrectly concatenating the string 'open http://' with the command script after the 5th character. This causes the original command to be cut off and the incorrect URL to be generated.

The issue with the function is that it is hardcoding the protocol 'http://' and assuming that the command script will always start with 'open '. Additionally, the function is cutting off the first 5 characters of the command script without considering their actual content.

To fix the bug, the function should first check if the command script starts with 'open ' and then extract the URL from the command script. It should also handle cases where the protocol is not 'http://'. 

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if command.script.startswith('open '):
        url = command.script.split(' ', 1)[-1]
        if not url.startswith('http://') and not url.startswith('https://'):
            url = 'http://' + url
        return 'open ' + url
    else:
        return command.script
```

This corrected function handles the edge cases correctly and ensures that the URL is extracted and concatenated with the correct protocol.
