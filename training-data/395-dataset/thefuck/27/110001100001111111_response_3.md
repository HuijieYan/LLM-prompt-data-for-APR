Potential error location: The buggy function is trying to extract the URL from the command and add "http://" to the beginning.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The buggy function assumes that the command input always starts with "open". However, in cases where the command is not "open", such as "xdg-open", "gnome-open", or "kde-open", the function will produce an incorrect URL.

Approaches for fixing the bug: Instead of assuming that the command always starts with "open", we can check if the command starts with "http://" or "https://". If it does, we return the command as is. Otherwise, we prefix "http://" to the command and return it.

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if command.script.startswith('http://') or command.script.startswith('https://'):
        return command.script
    else:
        return 'http://' + command.script.split('open ', 1)[-1]
```
