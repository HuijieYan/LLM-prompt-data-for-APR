The buggy function `get_new_command` takes in a `command` and `settings` as input and returns a modified string. The function is supposed to prepend 'http://' to the input script of the command.

The reason for the error is that in the buggy function, the indexing is not being done correctly. It should start from the 4th character of the input string, not the 5th. This causes the function to return incorrect output, which leads to the assertion errors in the test cases.

To fix the bug, the correct index should be used to extract the command script from the input string. The corrected code is as follows:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return command.script[:4] + ' http://' + command.script[5:]
```

This modification will extract characters from the 5th position onward in the command script, as intended, and prepend 'http://' to the extracted string. This should resolve the bug and make the function work as expected.
