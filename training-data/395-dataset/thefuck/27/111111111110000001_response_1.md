The problem occurs in the `get_new_command` function. The function is designed to add 'http://' in front of the domain part of the original command. For example, for the command 'open foo.com', the function should return 'open http://foo.com'. However, there is a bug in the function. It is taking the substring starting from index 5 of the command's script, which is creating issues for commands like 'xdg-open', 'gnome-open', and 'kde-open'. 

The bug occurs because the function does not differentiate between different types of commands and assumes that the domain will always start at index 5.

To fix the bug, the function should consider different cases based on the command type. If the command starts with 'open', it should extract the domain from index 5. For other commands, it should extract the domain from index 9.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if command.script.startswith('open'):
        return 'open http://' + command.script[5:]
    elif command.script.startswith('xdg-open'):
        return 'xdg-open http://' + command.script[9:]
    elif command.script.startswith('gnome-open'):
        return 'gnome-open http://' + command.script[11:]
    elif command.script.startswith('kde-open'):
        return 'kde-open http://' + command.script[9:]
```

This modifies the function to handle different types of commands and extract the domain part accordingly.
