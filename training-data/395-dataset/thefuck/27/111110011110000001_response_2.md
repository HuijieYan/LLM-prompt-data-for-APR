The bug occurs in the `get_new_command` function. The function is supposed to return a new command by with the prefix 'http://' added to the original command's script. However, the current implementation is faulty due to the incorrect indexing of the original command and missing concatenation operators.

The index `command.script[5:]` is not suitable for extracting the domain from the original command. It only works in the specific case where the original command starts with 'open ' followed by the domain. Additionally, the missing concatenation operator leads to the incorrect formation of the returned command.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to accurately extract and concatenate the domain with the 'http://' prefix before returning the new command.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    prefix = 'http://'
    domain = command.script.split(' ')[1]  # Extract the domain from the original command
    return f'open {prefix}{domain}'
```

This corrected function will handle various cases where the original command might have different formats and accurately construct the new command by adding the 'http://' prefix to the domain. This should resolve the errors in the test cases provided.
