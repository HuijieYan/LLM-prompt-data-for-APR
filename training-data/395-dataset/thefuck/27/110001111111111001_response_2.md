The buggy function `get_new_command` attempts to manipulate the `command` script, adding "http://" at the start. The bug involves accessing `command.script` incorrectly, which leads to the wrong output. The input and expected values are related to the formation of URLs for different domains. 

The error message from the test function indicates that the expected new command result does not match the output from the `get_new_command` function. This implies that the bug may be related to how the function processes the input.

The potential error in the buggy function lies in the line:
```python
return 'open http://' + command.script[5:]
```
The bug occurs because the function assumes that the `command.script` always starts with "open ", but this is not always the case (e.g., "xdg-open", "gnome-open", "kde-open"). This assumption leads to incorrect string slicing and concatenation.

To fix the bug, the function should consider the different prefixes for `command.script` and adjust the slicing accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if command.script.startswith('open '):
        return 'open http://' + command.script[5:]
    elif command.script.startswith('xdg-open '):
        return 'xdg-open http://' + command.script[9:]
    elif command.script.startswith('gnome-open '):
        return 'gnome-open http://' + command.script[11:]
    elif command.script.startswith('kde-open '):
        return 'kde-open http://' + command.script[9:]
    else:
        return None  # handle other cases appropriately
```
With this correction, the function checks the prefix of `command.script` and slices the URL appropriately, leading to the desired new command output.
