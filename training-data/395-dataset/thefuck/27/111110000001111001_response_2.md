The buggy function "get_new_command" is intended to extract the URL from the "command.script" and append it to the string 'open http://'. However, the current implementation uses an index of 5 to extract the URL, which assumes that the command will always start with "open ". This will cause an incorrect output for any other command that doesn't start with "open ".

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to check if the command starts with "open " before extracting the URL. If it does, we can extract the URL and append it to 'open http://'. Otherwise, we can return the original command as is.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if command.script.startswith('open '):
        return 'open http://' + command.script[5:]
    else:
        return command.script
```
