The bug is occurring in the `get_new_command` function. The function is intended to return a new command with the format 'open http://' followed by the original command script.

The reason behind the bug is that the function is incorrectly indexing the `command.script` string with [5:]. This causes the function to miss the first five characters of the command script when forming the new command.

To fix the bug, the function should use [5:] for slicing. This will start the string from the 5th character, and the new command will be formed correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return 'open http://' + command.script.split(' ')[1]
```

This correction splits the `command.script` string by the space and selects the second element, which represents the URL in the command script. This ensures that the new command is formed correctly.
