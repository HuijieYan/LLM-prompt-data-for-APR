Potential error location: The substring starting at index 5 of the command.script is being appended to the string 'open http://', which might not be the correct way to extract the URL.

Reason for the bug: The substring starting at index 5 of the command.script is directly appended to 'open http://', but it is not clear if this substring represents a valid URL.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We can use regular expressions to extract the URL from the command.script more reliably.

Corrected code:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    url_match = re.search(r'http[s]?://(?:[a-zA-Z]|[0-9]|[$-_@.&+]|[!*\\(,)]|(?:%[0-9a-fA-F][0-9a-fA-F]))+', command.script)
    if url_match:
        return 'open ' + url_match.group(0)
    else:
        return command
```
