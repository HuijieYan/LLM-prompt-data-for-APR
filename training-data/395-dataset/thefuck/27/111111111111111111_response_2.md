The buggy function is `get_new_command(command, settings)` which takes in a command and settings and returns a modified command.

The problem is occurring because the current implementation is assuming that the command always starts with "open ", and then it tries to construct a new command with "open http://" followed by the rest of the original command. This approach is causing issues for commands that don't start with "open ".

To fix the bug, the implementation needs to be more flexible and check if the command starts with "open " before modifying it.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if command.script.startswith('open '):
        return 'open http://' + command.script[5:]
    else:
        return 'open http://' + command.script
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to verify if the command starts with "open ". If it does, then we proceed with the modification as before. If not, we still construct the new command with "open http://" followed by the entire original command. This makes the function more robust and should fix the issues identified in the test cases.
