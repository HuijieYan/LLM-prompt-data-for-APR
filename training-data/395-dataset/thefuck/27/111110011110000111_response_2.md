The error lies in the `get_new_command` function. The function is not correctly parsing the input command and adding "http://" before the domain name. 

The reason for the bug is that the function is attempting to access the 5th index of `command.script` without checking if the string is long enough, which is causing an index out of range error. Additionally, the function assumes that the input string always starts with "open", which may not be the case.

To fix this bug, the function can be modified to check if the input string starts with "open" and then extract the domain name after "open" if it exists. We can use string manipulation operations like split to achieve this.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if command.script.startswith('open'):
        domain = command.script.split(' ')[1]
        return 'open http://' + domain
    else:
        return command.script
```
