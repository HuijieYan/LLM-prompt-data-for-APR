The buggy function is supposed to take a command and settings as input and return a new command. It takes the script attribute of the command and appends it to 'open http://' before returning it. 

The bug in the function is that it assumes the input command always starts with 'open'. If the input command does not start with 'open', the function will not work as expected.

To fix this, we can modify the function to check if the script starts with 'open'. If it does, we can append it to 'http://'. Otherwise, we can simply return the script without modification.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if command.script.startswith('open'):
        return 'open http://' + command.script[5:]
    else:
        return command.script
```
