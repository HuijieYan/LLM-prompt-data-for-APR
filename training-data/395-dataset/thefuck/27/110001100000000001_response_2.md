Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the slicing of the command.script.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the index used for slicing the command.script is hardcoded as 5, which might not be applicable for all cases. It assumes that the command being passed will always start with 'http://', but this may not always be the case.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Instead of using a hardcoded index, we can use the startswith() method to check if the command starts with 'http://' and then extract the URL accordingly. This will make the function more robust and applicable to a wider range of commands.

Corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if command.script.startswith('http://'):
        return 'open ' + command.script
    else:
        return 'open http://' + command.script
```
