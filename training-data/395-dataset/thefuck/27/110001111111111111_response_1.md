The error occurs in the `get_new_command` function. The function appends "open http://" to the provided command and includes the command's script from the 5th index position onwards. However, the expected behavior should be to exclude the "open" keyword from the new command.

The reason behind the bug is that the function is not correctly extracting the domain name from the input command.

To fix the bug, the function should extract the domain name correctly. The corrected function is as follows:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    url = command.script.split()[1]
    return f'open http://{url}'
```

By splitting the command at spaces and taking the second part as the URL, the function correctly retrieves the domain name.
