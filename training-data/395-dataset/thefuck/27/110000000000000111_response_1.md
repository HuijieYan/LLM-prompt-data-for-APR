Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the line "command.script[5:]" because it's trying to access characters of the script string without checking if it exists or not.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The current implementation assumes that the "command" parameter has a "script" attribute with at least 5 characters, which may not always be the case. This can lead to an IndexError if the script attribute is shorter than 5 characters.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: To fix this bug, we can first check the length of the "command" script before trying to access characters at specific positions in it.

Corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if len(command.script) > 5:
        return 'open http://' + command.script[5:]
    else:
        return 'open http://'
```
