Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the `get_new_command` function at the line `return 'open http://' + command.script[5:]`. This line is attempting to extract the URL from the `command.script` attribute, and then prepends it with "open http://".

Reasons behind the bug: The bug occurs because the code is hard-coding the prefix "open http://" without checking the command.script for the starting characters.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, the code should check if the command.script starts with "open" and then construct the URL accordingly. If it doesn't start with "open", a default prefix should be used.

Corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if command.script.startswith('open '):
        return 'open http://' + command.script[5:]
    else:
        return 'open http://' + command.script
```
