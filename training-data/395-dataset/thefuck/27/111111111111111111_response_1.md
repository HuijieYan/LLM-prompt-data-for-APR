The buggy function is `get_new_command`, which takes in a `command` and `settings` as parameters and returns a modified command. The function is currently not handling the input `command` correctly, leading to incorrect output.

The error message from the test function states that the expected and actual values are not matching. This indicates that the function is not producing the correct output.

The potential error in the code is the indexing used to extract the URL from the `command.script` string. It currently uses a fixed index (5) to start the URL extraction, which may not be appropriate for all input strings.

The bug occurs because the function assumes that the URL always starts at index 5 of the input `command.script`. This is not true for all cases, as URLs can have different lengths and different values preceding "http://" or "https://".

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to find the index of "http://" or "https://" within the `command.script` and extract the URL accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    url_start = command.script.find("http://")
    if url_start == -1:  # If "http://" is not found, search for "https://"
        url_start = command.script.find("https://")
    if url_start != -1:  # If "http://" or "https://" is found
        url = command.script[url_start:]  # Extract the URL from the command
        return f'open {url}'
    else:
        return f'open {command.script}'  # If "http://" or "https://" is not found, return the original command
```

This corrected code uses the `find` method to search for the indices of "http://" or "https://" within the `command.script`. If found, it extracts the URL accordingly, otherwise, it returns the original `command.script`. This approach ensures that the function handles different input cases appropriately.
