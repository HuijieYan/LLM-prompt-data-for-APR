In this case, the function `get_new_command` is supposed to take a command as input and then return a modified version of that command with 'http://' added to the script part. However, the current implementation is incorrect because it adds 'http://' to the command script by using a fixed index (5) which may not be always correct. 

The bug is occurring because the function assumes that the input script always starts with 'open', which may not be the case for some commands (e.g., 'xdg-open', 'gnome-open', 'kde-open'). This causes the incorrect addition of 'http://' to the script part.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the script starts with 'open' and then modify the script accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    parts = command.script.split(' ')
    if parts[0] in ['open', 'xdg-open', 'gnome-open', 'kde-open']:
        return f'{parts[0]} http://{parts[1]}'
    else:
        return command.script  # Return the unchanged command if it doesn't start with 'open' or its alternatives
```

With this modification, the function will correctly handle commands that start with 'open', 'xdg-open', 'gnome-open', or 'kde-open' and provide the expected modified commands for the given test cases.
