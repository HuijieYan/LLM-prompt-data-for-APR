Potential error location: 
The error is likely coming from the use of "command.script[5:]" which is trying to extract a substring from the command. This may not work as intended.

Reason for the bug:
The function is trying to extract a substring from the command using an index value of 5. However, this assumes that the command always starts with "http://", which may not be the case.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
We can use Python's string methods to check if the command starts with "http://", and then extract the substring accordingly.

Corrected code:
```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if command.script.startswith('http://'):
        return command.script
    else:
        return 'open http://' + command.script
```
