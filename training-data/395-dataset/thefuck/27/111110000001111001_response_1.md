The current function is attempting to extract the URL from the `command.script` parameter by using a hardcoded index of 5, which will only work if the command starts with "open ", but will fail for other cases such as "xdg-open", "gnome-open", or "kde-open".

To fix the bug:
1. We need to check if `command.script` starts with "open" and if it does, then extract the substring starting from the index of 5. Otherwise, we need to extract the substring following the space, which can be done by finding the index of the first space and extracting the substring from there.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if command.script.startswith('open'):
        return 'open http://' + command.script[5:]
    else:
        return 'open http://' + command.script.split(' ')[1]
```
