The buggy function `get_new_command` is expected to take a command and return a new command in the form of "open http://<url>". However, the buggy implementation is incorrectly using the index `[5:]` to try to obtain the URL from the input script. This approach is not reliable as it assumes that the input command's URL always starts at the 6th character of the script.

The error message from the test function also confirms that the outputs are not as expected, indicating that the URL extraction and concatenation process within the `get_new_command` function is flawed.

To fix this bug, it's important to parse the command's script to accurately extract the URL. This can be done by splitting the script and extracting the URL component. Use a reliable method to handle the URL extraction to ensure consistency in extracting the URL from different types of commands.

Here is the corrected function implementation:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    script_parts = command.script.split(' ')
    return f"{script_parts[0]} http://{script_parts[1]}"
```

This corrected implementation splits the input script by space and assumes that the second part of the split will be the URL. It also uses f-strings for easier string interpolation.
