Potential Error Location: The error is occurring in the line `return 'open http://' + command.script[5:]`, where the function is trying to extract the URL from the command.

Reason for the Bug: The bug is occurring because the function is trying to extract the URL from the command by using the index value [5:]. This assumes that the URL will always start at the 6th character of the command, which may not always be the case.

Approach for Fixing the Bug: Instead of using a fixed index [5:], a more robust approach would be to split the command by spaces and then check each part to see if it starts with "http://" or "https://". This will handle different scenarios where the URL might appear in different positions in the command.

Corrected Code:
```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    parts = command.script.split()
    for part in parts:
        if part.startswith("http://") or part.startswith("https://"):
            return 'open ' + part
    return 'open'  # Handle case where no URL is found
```
