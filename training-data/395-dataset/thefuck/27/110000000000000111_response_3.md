Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the way the command string is being handled and manipulated. It seems that the function is trying to extract a substring after the first 5 characters of the command, assuming that the 'script' attribute is a string.

Reason behind the bug: The script attribute is not defined or does not exist in the command parameter. It seems that the intended parameter should be a string.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Check if the 'command' parameter is a valid string before accessing its attributes.
2. Use string manipulation methods to extract the desired substring from the command parameter.
3. Handle cases where the command parameter does not have the expected format.

Corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if isinstance(command, str) and len(command) > 5:
        return 'open http://' + command[5:]
    else:
        return 'Invalid command'
```
