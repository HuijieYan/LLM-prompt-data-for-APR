Potential error location:
The buggy function is trying to extract the URL from the `command.script` string by using string slicing. The slicing index is fixed at 5, which may not work if the input string is not always in the same format.

Reason for the bug:
The bug occurs because the function assumes that the URL will always be at the same position in the input string, which may not be the case. This can lead to incorrect output or errors when trying to extract the URL.

Possible approaches to fix the bug:
1. Use a more reliable method to extract the URL from the input string, such as regular expressions, which can handle variations in the format of the input string.
2. Check if the input string starts with "open http://" before extracting the URL to ensure that the input is in the expected format.
3. Handle cases where the input string does not match the expected format to avoid errors.

Corrected code:
```python
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if command.script.startswith('open http://'):
        return command.script
    else:
        url_match = re.search(r'http[s]?://(?:[a-zA-Z]|[0-9]|[$-_@.&+]|[!*\\(\\),]|(?:%[0-9a-fA-F][0-9a-fA-F]))+', command.script)
        if url_match:
            return url_match.group(0)
        else:
            return 'Invalid URL format'
```
