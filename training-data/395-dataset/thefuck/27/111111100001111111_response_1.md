The buggy function, get_new_command, takes a command and settings as input and returns a modified command. It adds 'http://' in front of the script attribute of the input command.

The issue with the current implementation is that it assumes the input will always start with 'open '. This limitation causes the function to fail for inputs that do not start with 'open '.

To fix the bug, the function should check if the input command script starts with 'open '. If it does, it should append 'http://' in front. If it doesn't, it should simply return the input command script.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if command.script.startswith('open '):
        return 'open http://' + command.script[5:]
    else:
        return command.script
```
