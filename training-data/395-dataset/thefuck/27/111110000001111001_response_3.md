The buggy function 'get_new_command' takes two parameters, 'command' and 'settings', and returns a string that opens a website using the URL provided in the 'script' attribute of the 'command' parameter. The issue with this function is that it is not extracting the URL correctly from the 'script' attribute.

The function is trying to extract the URL by slicing the 'command.script' attribute starting from index 5, assuming that the URL always starts at index 5. This is not a reliable approach as URLs can have different lengths and may not always start at the same index.

To fix this issue, we can modify the function to extract the URL using a more robust method. We can split the 'command.script' using the space character as a delimiter and take the second element from the resulting list, assuming that the URL is the second part of the command. This approach is more flexible and reliable.

Here's the corrected code for the 'get_new_command' function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    parts = command.script.split(' ')
    if len(parts) > 1:
        return 'open http://' + parts[1]
    else:
        return 'Invalid command'
```
