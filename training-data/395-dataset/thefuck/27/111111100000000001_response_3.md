Potential error location: The bug is located in the get_new_command function, specifically in the command.script[5:] portion. This code attempts to extract the URL from the command string, but it has a hardcoded index of 5, assuming that the URL always starts at the 6th character of the command. This will cause issues if the URL is not always located at that specific position.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug occurs because the function wrongly assumes the position of the URL in the command string and does not handle different positions.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use string manipulation functions to extract the URL from the command reliably.
2. Check if the command contains a valid URL before trying to extract it to prevent errors.

Corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    for word in split_command:
        if word.startswith('http'):
            return 'open ' + word
    return 'open'  # Default to 'open' if no URL is found
```
