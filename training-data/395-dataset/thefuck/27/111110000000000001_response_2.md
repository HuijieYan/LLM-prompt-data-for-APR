Potential error location: The bug is likely in the line where the function is trying to concatenate 'open http://' with a part of the command script.

Reason for the bug: The bug is caused by the hardcoded index value (5) used to slice the command script. This assumes that all commands will have the same format, which may not be the case.

Approach for fixing the bug: Instead of using a hardcoded index value, we should find a more robust way to extract the URL from the command script.

Corrected code:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if command.script.startswith('open http://'):
        return command.script
    else:
        return 'open http://' + command.script.split(' ')[-1]
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the command script already starts with 'open http://'. If it does, we simply return the command script as it is. If not, we assume that the URL is at the end of the command script, and we use the split method to extract it. This approach is more flexible and should work for commands with varying formats.
