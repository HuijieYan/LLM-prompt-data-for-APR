The problem with the provided function is in the `get_new_command` function. The function is supposed to prepend "open http://" to the script of the command. However, the current implementation is incorrect.

The error message from the test function indicates that the resulting command does not match the expected command. For example, for the input `xdg-open foo.io`, the expected output is `xdg-open http://foo.io`, but the actual output is `'open http://pen foo.io'`. This indicates that the function is not correctly modifying the input command.

The bug occurs because the function assumes that the input will always start with "open". However, there might be cases where the command starts with "xdg-open" or "gnome-open". The function needs to account for these cases as well.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the implementation of the `get_new_command` function to extract the domain name from the input script and prepend it with "http://" regardless of the initial command.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    # Split the script by spaces and take the last part as the domain
    domain = command.script.split()[-1]
    # Prepend the domain with "http://"
    return f"{command.script.split()[0]} http://{domain}"
```

This function first splits the input `command` by spaces and takes the last part as the domain. It then prepends the domain with "http://" and returns the modified command. This ensures that the function works correctly for all input command variations.
