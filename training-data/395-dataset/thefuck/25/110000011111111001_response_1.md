The problem with the given function is that it is referencing a non-existent decorator `@sudo_support` and it is also not importing the required `re` module. 

The function is trying to replace occurrences of `mkdir` with `mkdir -p` in the provided command. However, the `re.sub` function is not the appropriate approach here. It should be using string manipulation methods instead.

To fix the function, the following steps should be taken:
1. Remove the `@sudo_support` decorator as it does not exist.
2. Import the `re` module to use the `re.sub` function properly.
3. Change the function to manipulate the string directly without using `re.sub`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if command.script.startswith('mkdir '):
        return command.script.replace('mkdir ', 'mkdir -p ')
    elif command.script.startswith('hdfs dfs -mkdir '):
        return command.script.replace('hdfs dfs -mkdir ', 'hdfs dfs -mkdir -p ')
    else:
        return command.script
```

With the corrected function, the test cases should pass without any assertions.
