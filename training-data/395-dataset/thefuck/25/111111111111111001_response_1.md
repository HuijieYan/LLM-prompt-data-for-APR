The buggy function "get_new_command" uses regular expressions to replace 'mkdir' with 'mkdir -p' in the input command. The bug arises from the fact that the regular expression "re.sub('^mkdir (.*)', 'mkdir -p \\1', command.script)" does not handle cases where 'mkdir' is part of a larger command, such as 'hdfs dfs -mkdir'. This leads to incorrect replacements and failing test cases.

To fix this bug, we can modify the regular expression to only match when 'mkdir' is at the beginning of the command or preceded by a white space character. This ensures that 'mkdir' as part of a larger command is not affected.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
import re

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_25/thefuck/rules/mkdir_p.py

# corrected function
@sudo_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub(r'(^| )mkdir (.*)', r'\1mkdir -p \2', command.script)
```

With this corrected regular expression, the function should now correctly handle all cases and pass the provided test cases.
