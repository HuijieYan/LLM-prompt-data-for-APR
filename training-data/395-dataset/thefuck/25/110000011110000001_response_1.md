The test case is checking the behavior of the `get_new_command` function. The function is supposed to take a command and apply the regular expression substitution by adding the `-p` flag to the `mkdir` command if it's present in the input command.

The bug in the code is that it is missing the import statement for the `re` module. Additionally, the `sudo_support` decorator is being used without defining it.

To fix the bug:
1. Import the `re` module at the beginning of the file to use the regular expression functionality.
2. Create the `sudo_support` decorator or remove it if it's not required for the code to function properly.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub('^mkdir (.*)', 'mkdir -p \\1', command.script)
```
