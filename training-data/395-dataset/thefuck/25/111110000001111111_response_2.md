Potential error location: The function is using the @sudo_support decorator, but it is not defined in the provided code.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The @sudo_support decorator is not defined, so it is causing the function to fail.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define the @sudo_support decorator in the code.
2. Remove the @sudo_support decorator if it's not necessary for the function.

Corrected code:
```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub('^mkdir (.*)', 'mkdir -p \\1', command.script)
```
