The issue is with the regular expression replacement in the `get_new_command` function. The current implementation uses `^` to match the start of the line and then replaces it with `mkdir -p`. However, this approach is incorrect and causing the test cases to fail.

The reason for the failure is that the regular expression replacement should only replace "mkdir" followed by a space with "mkdir -p". It should not replace "mkdir" occurring in the middle of the command.

To fix this bug, the regular expression should be modified to correctly match "mkdir" followed by a space and then replace it with "mkdir -p".

Updated code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import re

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_25/thefuck/rules/mkdir_p.py

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub(r'^mkdir\s', 'mkdir -p ', command.script)
```

This code uses a regular expression to match "mkdir" followed by a space and then replaces it with "mkdir -p".

With this modification, the test cases should pass without any errors.
