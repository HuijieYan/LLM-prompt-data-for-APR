Potential error location: The error seems to be in the function itself, specifically in the use of the `@sudo_support` decorator and the `re.sub` function.

Reasons behind the bug: The `@sudo_support` decorator is not a standard Python decorator, so it's likely causing the error. Additionally, the use of the `re.sub` function is incorrect.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Remove the `@sudo_support` decorator and use the `re.compile` and `sub` functions from the `re` module to properly replace the command.

Corrected code:
```python
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    pattern = re.compile('^mkdir (.*)')
    return command.script.replace('mkdir ', 'mkdir -p ')
```
