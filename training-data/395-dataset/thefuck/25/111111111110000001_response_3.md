The test case and the error message show that the function `get_new_command` is not properly adding the `-p` flag to the `mkdir` command.

The potential error in the `get_new_command` function is in the `re.sub` line. It is not properly adding the `-p` flag to the `mkdir` command.

The bug occurs because the regular expression used in the `re.sub` function is not correctly capturing the input command and adding the `-p` flag.

To fix the bug, the regular expression pattern needs to be adjusted to correctly capture the directory path and add the `-p` flag to the `mkdir` command.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

# this is the corrected function
@sudo_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub(r'^mkdir (.*)', r'mkdir -p \1', command.script)
```
