The buggy function `get_new_command` is supposed to replace `mkdir` with `mkdir -p` in the input command string. However, the bug is that it does not handle cases where the command starts with './bin/hdfs'. The regular expression `^mkdir (.*)` matches only the `mkdir` command, but it should match the entire command including any leading path.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the regular expression to match any command starting with `mkdir` and not just the exact string 'mkdir'.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re

@sudo_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub('^(.*?mkdir) (.*)', '\\1 -p \\2', command.script)
```
