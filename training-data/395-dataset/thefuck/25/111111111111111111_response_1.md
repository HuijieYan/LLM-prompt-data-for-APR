The function `get_new_command` currently uses the `re.sub` method to replace the string 'mkdir' with 'mkdir -p' in the provided command. However, this approach has several issues.

The bug is occurring because the regular expression `^mkdir (.*)` doesn't account for instances where 'mkdir' is not at the beginning of the command, such as in the case of 'hdfs dfs -mkdir'. Additionally, the replacement is indiscriminately adding '-p' to the original command without considering the actual structure of the command.

To fix these issues, the regular expression pattern needs to be modified to match instances of 'mkdir' that may occur anywhere in the command. Additionally, the replacement should be applied only to instances of 'mkdir' that are standalone commands, not as part of another command.

Here's the corrected function with these changes:

```python
import re

# Assuming the Command class is defined somewhere and sudo_support decorator is imported
@sudo_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if command.script.startswith('mkdir '):
        return re.sub(r'(^|\s)mkdir(\s|$)', r'\1mkdir -p\2', command.script)
    else:
        return command.script
```

This updated function uses a regular expression pattern `(^|\s)mkdir(\s|$)` to match instances of 'mkdir' that are either at the beginning of the command or preceded by a space, and followed by either a space or the end of the string. It then replaces these instances with 'mkdir -p' while preserving the surrounding whitespace. If the instance of 'mkdir' is not found at the beginning of the command, it simply returns the original command.

The corrected function should address the issues and properly handle different types of 'mkdir' commands, as per the provided test cases.
