The issue with the given function is that it's trying to use a decorator `@sudo_support` without defining it, which results in a NameError. Additionally, the function is attempting to access the `command.script` attribute, which is not present in the provided `Command` class. The function is also incorrectly performing the substitution using `re.sub`, where a simpler string manipulation would suffice.

To fix the bug, the `@sudo_support` decorator should be defined or removed if it's not necessary. The function should access the `script` attribute directly from the `Command` object and perform the substitution accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if command.script.startswith('mkdir '):
        return 'mkdir -p ' + command.script[6:]
    elif command.script.startswith('hdfs dfs -mkdir '):
        return 'hdfs dfs -mkdir -p ' + command.script[16:]
    elif command.script.startswith('./bin/hdfs dfs -mkdir '):
        return './bin/hdfs dfs -mkdir -p ' + command.script[20:]
    else:
        return command.script
```

This modified function eliminates the need for the `re.sub` and correctly handles the substitution based on the prefixes in the `command.script` string. This should resolve the issues observed in the test cases.
