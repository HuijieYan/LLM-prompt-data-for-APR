Potential error location: 
The issue seems to be with the `re.sub` function, where the replacement pattern is not formatted correctly.

Reasons behind the bug:
The replacement pattern in the `re.sub` function is not using the proper escape sequence for backreferences to capture groups.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
Use the correct escape sequence for backreferences in the replacement pattern.

Corrected code:
```python
import re

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_25/thefuck/rules/mkdir_p.py

# corrected function
@sudo_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub(r'^mkdir (.*)', r'mkdir -p \1', command.script)
```
