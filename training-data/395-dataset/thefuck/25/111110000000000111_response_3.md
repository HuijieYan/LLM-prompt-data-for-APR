Potential error location:
The potential error is in the use of the `@sudo_support` decorator, which is not a standard Python decorator and could be causing issues with the function execution.

Reason for the bug:
The `@sudo_support` decorator is not a recognized Python decorator, so it is likely causing the function to fail or not work as intended.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. If the `@sudo_support` decorator is a custom decorator, make sure it is correctly defined and applied to the function.
2. If the `@sudo_support` decorator is not necessary, simply remove it from the function definition.

Corrected code:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub('^mkdir (.*)', 'mkdir -p \\1', command.script)
```

If the `@sudo_support` decorator is essential and needs to be included, it should be defined and implemented correctly, ensuring it does not interfere with the function's functionality.
