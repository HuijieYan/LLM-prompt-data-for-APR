The buggy function is attempting to replace the `mkdir` command with `mkdir -p` in a given command script. The function is using the `re.sub` method, but it is missing the necessary import for the `re` module, and it's also not utilizing the `sudo_support` decorator correctly.

Additionally, the `command` object is being accessed as if it has a `script` attribute, but it appears to be a custom object of type `Command` and doesn't have a `script` attribute.

To fix this, we need to import the `re` module, use the `sudo_support` decorator correctly, and access the `script` attribute of the `command` object correctly.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# import the re module
import re

# this is the corrected function
@sudo_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    # check if command.script starts with "mkdir ", then replace it with "mkdir -p "
    if command.script.startswith("mkdir "):
        return command.script.replace("mkdir ", "mkdir -p ")
    else:
        return command.script
```

This function now checks if the command script starts with "mkdir " and replaces it with "mkdir -p " if it does. Otherwise, it returns the original command script.
