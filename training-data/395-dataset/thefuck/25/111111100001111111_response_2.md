The buggy function `get_new_command` is attempting to replace the `mkdir` command with `mkdir -p` using regular expressions. However, the code is not correctly handling cases where additional arguments are provided after `mkdir`, such as in the input `hdfs dfs -mkdir foo/bar/baz`. 

To fix this bug, we need to modify the regular expression to capture all characters after `mkdir` until the end of the string.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_25/thefuck/rules/mkdir_p.py

# this is the corrected function
@sudo_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub(r'(^mkdir .*)', r'mkdir -p \1', command.script)
```

With this correction, the regular expression now captures all characters after `mkdir` at the beginning of the string and replaces it with `mkdir -p`. This will ensure that all input cases are handled correctly.
