The bug in the given code is that the 're' module is not imported in the 'mkdir_p.py' file. This is causing the function to fail when calling 're.sub'.

To fix this bug:
1. Import the 're' module at the beginning of the 'mkdir_p.py' file.
2. Use the imported 're' module to perform the substitution in the 'get_new_command' function.

Here's the corrected function with the 're' module imported:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_25/thefuck/rules/mkdir_p.py
import re

@sudo_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub('^mkdir (.*)', 'mkdir -p \\1', command.script)
```

By making these changes, the function should work as expected.
