Potential error location: The use of 'command.script' in the function may not be appropriate as 'command' is not defined within the function.

Reason behind the bug: The function is trying to use 'command.script' without defining 'command' within the function. This is likely causing a NameError.

Approach to fix the bug: The function needs to be modified to properly handle the 'command' input and access its 'script' attribute.

Corrected code:

```python
import re

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_25/thefuck/rules/mkdir_p.py

# corrected function
@sudo_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub('^mkdir (.*)', r'mkdir -p \1', command.script)
```
