Potential Error Location: The issue is likely with the regular expression used in the `get_new_command` function to match the `mkdir` command and add the `-p` flag.

Reason for the Bug: The regular expression `^mkdir (.*)` is used to match the `mkdir` command and capture its arguments. However, the function is returning the modified command with the `-p` flag directly without considering the possibility of the command being prefixed with something like `hdfs dfs`.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: We can modify the regular expression to handle commands like `hdfs dfs` by optionally capturing the prefix before the `mkdir` command. Additionally, we should use the captured groups in the replacement string to retain the prefix if it exists.

Corrected Code:
```python
import re

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_25/thefuck/rules/mkdir_p.py

# Define the sudo_support decorator
def sudo_support(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        pass  # Placeholder for sudo_support functionality
    return wrapper

# Fix the get_new_command function
@sudo_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub('^(.*[\/\w]+\s+mkdir) (.*)', r'\1 -p \2', command.script)

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_25/tests/rules/test_mkdir_p.py

# Update the test case to use the corrected function
@pytest.mark.parametrize('command, new_command', [
    (Command('mkdir foo/bar/baz'), 'mkdir -p foo/bar/baz'),
    (Command('hdfs dfs -mkdir foo/bar/baz'), 'hdfs dfs -mkdir -p foo/bar/baz'),
    (Command('./bin/hdfs dfs -mkdir foo/bar/baz'), './bin/hdfs dfs -mkdir -p foo/bar/baz')])
def test_get_new_command(command, new_command):
    assert get_new_command(command, None) == new_command
