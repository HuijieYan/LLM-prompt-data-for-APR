# Buggy function source code
```python
# this is the buggy function you need to fix
@sudo_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub('^mkdir (.*)', 'mkdir -p \\1', command.script)
```

# Corrected function
```python
import re

# this is the corrected function
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub('^sudo mkdir (.*)', 'sudo mkdir -p \\1', command.script)
```

Explanation:
The original code has a few issues:
- The `sudo_support` decorator is not defined and its purpose is not clear. Therefore, it's better to remove it for simplicity.
- The regular expression pattern `'mkdir (.*)'` only matches for 'mkdir' commands, but does not handle the case where 'sudo mkdir' commands are used.

To fix the issues, the code has been modified to use a regular expression pattern that matches 'sudo mkdir' commands and replaces them with 'sudo mkdir -p' instead.
