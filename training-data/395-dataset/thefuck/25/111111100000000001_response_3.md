Potential Error Location: The issue lies in the use of the `re.sub` method to replace the `mkdir` command with `mkdir -p`. 

Reason for the Bug: The regular expression `^mkdir (.*)` is matching the entire command and replacing it with `mkdir -p \\1`. This means it will replace the entire command with just `mkdir -p` followed by the original arguments.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug: We need to capture the directory path after `mkdir` and then use it to construct the new command with `mkdir -p`.

Corrected Code:
```python
import re

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_25/thefuck/rules/mkdir_p.py

# corrected function
@sudo_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub('^mkdir (.*)', r'mkdir -p \1', command.script)
```
