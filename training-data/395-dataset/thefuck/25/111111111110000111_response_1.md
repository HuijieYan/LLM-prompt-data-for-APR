The provided function `get_new_command` is meant to replace instances of `mkdir` with `mkdir -p`. However, the current implementation uses the `command.script` attribute directly, which doesn't seem to be the correct attribute to access the actual command string.

The error in the buggy function occurs because the function is not correctly replacing the command string as expected, leading to the test cases failing due to the incorrect comparison of the output.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to use the `command.script` attribute and the `re.sub()` method appropriately for replacing the command string as intended.

Below is the corrected function:

```python
import re

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_25/thefuck/rules/mkdir_p.py

# corrected version of the function
@sudo_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub('^(hdfs dfs -)?mkdir (.*)', '\\1mkdir -p \\2', command.script)
```

In the corrected function, the regular expression `re.sub('^(hdfs dfs -)?mkdir (.*)', '\\1mkdir -p \\2', command.script)` is used to replace instances of `mkdir` with `mkdir -p` in the command string. It also accounts for the optional prefix `hdfs dfs -` in the command, allowing for proper replacement.

The updated function should now correctly modify the command string and resolve the issue observed in the provided test cases.
