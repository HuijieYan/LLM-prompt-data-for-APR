The error in the provided function is the use of the '@sudo_support' decorator, which is not a valid Python decorator. The potential error location is the use of this invalid decorator, which is causing the function to fail.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the '@sudo_support' decorator is not a valid Python decorator, and the function definition lacks a valid decorator.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the invalid decorator and update the function definition accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub('^mkdir (.*)', 'mkdir -p \\1', command.script)
```
