The problem with the `get_new_command` function is that it is not correctly handling commands that are not just `mkdir`. The regular expression `^mkdir (.*)` only matches strings that start with `mkdir`, followed by a space and then some characters. For cases where the command is more complex, like `hdfs dfs -mkdir`, it does not work correctly.

To fix this, the regular expression needs to be updated to handle more complex command strings.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
@sudo_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub(r'^(mkdir|hdfs dfs -mkdir) (.*)', r'\1 -p \2', command.script)
```
