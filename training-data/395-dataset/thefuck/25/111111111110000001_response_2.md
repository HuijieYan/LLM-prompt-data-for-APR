The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `get_new_command` function. The bug occurs because the `re.sub` method is being used incorrectly. The replacement pattern should include the entire original string, not just the part that matches the regex pattern.

To fix the bug, the replacement pattern in the `re.sub` method should be changed. The corrected code for the `get_new_command` function is as follows:

```python
import re

# this is the corrected function
@sudo_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub('^mkdir ', 'mkdir -p ', command.script)
```

The corrected code replaces the entire 'mkdir' command with 'mkdir -p', ensuring that all instances of 'mkdir' are replaced with 'mkdir -p'. This should resolve the bug and make the function behave as expected.
