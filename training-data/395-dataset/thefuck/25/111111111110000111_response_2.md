The function `get_new_command` is intended to take a command and return a modified version of that command, replacing `mkdir` with `mkdir -p`. However, it seems that the function is not handling commands that have additional words in front of `mkdir`.

The error message indicates that the function is not correctly modifying the command when additional words are present. For example, the command `'hdfs dfs -mkdir foo/bar/baz'` should be modified to `'hdfs dfs -mkdir -p foo/bar/baz'`, but the function is returning `'hdfs dfs -mkdir -p foo/bar/baz'` instead.

The bug occurs because the regular expression `^mkdir (.*)` used in the `re.sub` function is matching only commands that start with `mkdir`. It does not account for commands that have additional words before `mkdir`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the regular expression to capture the entire command and then replace `mkdir` with `mkdir -p`.

Here's the corrected `get_new_command` function:

```python
@sudo_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub(r'(^|\s)mkdir(\s|$)', 'mkdir -p', command.script)
```

This modified code uses the regular expression `(^|\s)mkdir(\s|$)` to match either the start of the command or a whitespace followed by `mkdir`, and matches either a whitespace or the end of the command after `mkdir`. It then replaces `mkdir` with `mkdir -p`, capturing and preserving any whitespace around `mkdir`.

With this change, the function should correctly modify commands like `'hdfs dfs -mkdir foo/bar/baz'` to `'hdfs dfs -mkdir -p foo/bar/baz'`.
