The buggy function is supposed to take a command and modify it so that it includes the `-p` option for the `mkdir` command. However, the `re.sub` function is not used correctly. The `re.sub` function replaces the first occurrence of a pattern in a string, but it is being used as if it will replace the entire command.

To fix this bug, we need to change the way the regular expression is used in the `re.sub` function.


```python
import re

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_25/thefuck/rules/mkdir_p.py

# this is the fixed function
@sudo_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub(r'^mkdir ', 'mkdir -p ', command.script)
```
