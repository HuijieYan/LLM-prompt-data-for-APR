Potential error location: The `re.sub` function in the `get_new_command` method is attempting to replace the `mkdir` command with `mkdir -p` without taking into account the possibility of additional arguments after the directory path.

Reason behind the bug: The regular expression `^mkdir (.*)` only matches the `mkdir` command followed by a directory path. It does not account for the possibility of additional flags or options after the directory path.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, we can modify the regular expression to capture the entire command and then replace only the `mkdir` part with `mkdir -p`.

Corrected code:
```python
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub(r'(^mkdir\s)(.*)', r'mkdir -p \2', command.script)
```
