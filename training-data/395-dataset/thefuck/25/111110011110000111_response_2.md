The error occurs because the function `get_new_command` is trying to apply a regex substitution on the `command.script`, which does not match the format of the script provided in the test cases.

The bug is in the `get_new_command` function where the `re.sub` method is being called incorrectly. The `re.sub` method expects the first argument to be the pattern to be replaced, and the second argument to be the replacement. However, in the buggy function, the order of arguments is reversed.

To fix the bug, we need to switch the order of the arguments passed to `re.sub`.

Here's the corrected `get_new_command` function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub(r'^(mkdir .*)', r'\1 -p', command.script)
```

In this corrected function, the first argument to `re.sub` is the pattern to be replaced, and the second argument is the replacement. Additionally, I've added the `r` specifier before the strings in `re.sub` to treat them as raw strings.
