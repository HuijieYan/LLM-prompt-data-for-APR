Potential Error Location: The buggy function is using the re.sub function to replace the 'mkdir' string with 'mkdir -p'. However, the regex pattern '^mkdir (.*)' doesn't match the command.script in Buggy Case 2 and Buggy Case 3 because it has additional characters before 'mkdir'.

Reason for the Bug: The regex pattern '^mkdir (.*)' only matches the command.script in Buggy Case 1, where the command.script starts with 'mkdir'. It doesn't account for cases where the command.script starts with './bin/hdfs dfs -mkdir' or 'hdfs dfs -mkdir'.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: 
1. Update the regex pattern to match any variation of the 'mkdir' command at the beginning of the script.
2. Use a conditional statement to check if the command.script starts with 'mkdir' and then perform the substitution.

Corrected Code:
```python
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if command.script.startswith('mkdir'):
        return re.sub(r'^(mkdir .*)', r'mkdir -p \1', command.script)
    else:
        return command.script
```
In the corrected code, we first check if the command.script starts with 'mkdir'. If it does, we then use the re.sub function to replace the 'mkdir' string with 'mkdir -p'. If the command.script doesn't start with 'mkdir', we return the original command.script. This approach ensures that the substitution is only applied to the 'mkdir' command at the beginning of the script.
