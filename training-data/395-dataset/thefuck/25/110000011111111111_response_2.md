The buggy function is not correctly handling the input command string. It is supposed to add the `-p` flag after the `mkdir` command, but it is currently adding it before the entire command. This means that the replacements are not matching the expected new commands in the test cases.

The regular expression `re.sub('^mkdir (.*)', 'mkdir -p \\1', command.script)` is adding `-p` before the captured directory string (`(.*)`), but it should be adding it after `mkdir`. 

To fix this, the correct regular expression to use would be: `re.sub('^mkdir (.*)', 'mkdir -p \\1', command.script)`

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub('^mkdir (.*)', 'mkdir -p \\1', command.script)
```
