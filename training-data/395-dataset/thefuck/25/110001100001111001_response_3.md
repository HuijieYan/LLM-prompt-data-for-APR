The buggy function is using the `re` module but it hasn't been imported in the code. This is causing the `re.sub` function to fail, resulting in an error.

To fix this bug, we need to import the `re` module at the beginning of the code.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re

@sudo_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub('^mkdir (.*)', 'mkdir -p \\1', command.script)
```
