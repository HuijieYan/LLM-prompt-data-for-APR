The problematic function `get_new_command` is supposed to take a command and settings as input, and then modify the command by adding the `-p` flag to the `mkdir` command. However, the use of `@sudo_support` suggests that there might be some decorator causing issues, but the decorator itself is not provided in the code snippet.

The error in the test case is caused by the fact that the function is not correctly adding the `-p` flag to the `mkdir` command. It fails to perform the intended behavior and results in an assertion error.

To fix the bug, the `re.sub` function should be used with the correct pattern and replacement to add the `-p` flag to the `mkdir` command. Additionally, the `@sudo_support` decorator should be removed or implemented correctly.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub(r'^mkdir (.*)', r'mkdir -p \1', command.script)
```

This code uses the `re.sub` function to correctly substitute the pattern `^mkdir (.*)` with the replacement `mkdir -p \1` in the `command` string.
