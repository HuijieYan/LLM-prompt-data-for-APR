The potential error in the provided function is the use of the `@sudo_support` decorator, which is not defined in the given code. This is likely causing a syntax error or an AttributeError.

To fix the function, we can remove the `@sudo_support` decorator and use the `re.sub()` method directly to replace the matched pattern with the modified string.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub('^mkdir (.*)', r'mkdir -p \1', command.script)
```

In this corrected code:
- We import the `re` module to use regular expression functions.
- We define the `get_new_command` function without the `@sudo_support` decorator.
- We use the `re.sub()` function to replace the matched pattern with the modified string. 
- In the replacement string, we use raw string (denoted by the `r` before the string) to avoid unwanted escape sequences.
