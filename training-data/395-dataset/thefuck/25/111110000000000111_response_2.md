Potential Error Location:
The error is likely occurring in the use of the `@sudo_support` decorator, which is not defined in the provided code.

Reasons behind the Bug:
1. The `@sudo_support` decorator is not defined, so it is causing a syntax error.
2. It seems like the intent of the decorator is to add support for sudo, but without seeing its implementation, it's hard to tell for sure.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Define the `@sudo_support` decorator with appropriate functionality to handle sudo commands.
2. If the intention is simply to add support for sudo, then modify the function to include sudo directly without the need for a decorator.

Corrected Code:

```python
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub('^mkdir (.*)', 'sudo mkdir -p \\1', command.script)
```

In this corrected code, the `@sudo_support` decorator has been removed, and the sudo command has been directly incorporated into the string substitution, assuming that the intention was to add support for sudo.
