The issue with the `get_new_command` function is that it uses the `script` attribute of the `command` object when it should be using the `command` object itself to access the `script` attribute. This is causing the incorrect substitution of the `mkdir` command with `-p`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is the incorrect usage of the `command` object to access the `script` attribute.

To fix the bug, the function should directly use the `command` object to access the `script` attribute and perform the substitution.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@sudo_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub('^mkdir (.*)', 'mkdir -p \\1', command.script)
```
