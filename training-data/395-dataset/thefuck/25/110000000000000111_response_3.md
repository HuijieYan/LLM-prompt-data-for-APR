The potential error in the provided function is that it is using a decorator `@sudo_support` which is not defined in the function. It seems like the intention was to have a decorator that supports sudo permissions.

The bug occurred because the `@sudo_support` decorator is not defined, so it is causing a syntax error.

To fix the bug, the `@sudo_support` decorator needs to be defined to support sudo permissions. Additionally, the `re` module needs to be imported for the `re.sub` function to work.

Corrected code:

```python
import re

def sudo_support(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        # Add logic to support sudo permissions
        pass
    return wrapper

@sudo_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub('^mkdir (.*)', 'mkdir -p \\1', command.script)
```
