The issue is with the `get_new_command` function, where the regular expression substitution logic is incorrect. The function tries to replace the string "mkdir" at the beginning of the command with "mkdir -p", but it does not consider the possibility of "mkdir" being part of a path (e.g., in the case of "hdfs dfs -mkdir"). As a result, the regular expression substitution is not adequate for all cases and leads to incorrect output.

To fix this bug, the function should properly handle cases where "mkdir" is part of the path and not at the beginning of the command. Additionally, it should not assume that the command starts with "mkdir", as it can be preceded by a path or other commands.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re

# Assuming sudo_support is imported from somewhere
@sudo_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub(r'\bmkdir\b', 'mkdir -p', command.script)
```

In this corrected function, the regular expression `r'\bmkdir\b'` is used to match the word "mkdir" specifically, without being part of another word (e.g., "hdfs dfs -mkdir"). This ensures that it only replaces standalone occurrences of "mkdir" with "mkdir -p". This solution handles all the provided test cases correctly.
