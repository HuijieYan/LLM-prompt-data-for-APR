The error occurs in the `get_new_command` function, where it tries to replace "mkdir" with "mkdir -p" in the provided command script.

The function is trying to access `command.script`, but `command` seems to be an object with a `script` attribute, not a property. It may be causing the function to throw errors.

To fix the bug, the function should access the `script` attribute directly from the `command` object.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub('^mkdir (.*)', 'mkdir -p \\1', command)
```
