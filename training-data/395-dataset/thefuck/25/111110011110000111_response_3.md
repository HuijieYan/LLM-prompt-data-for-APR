The function is intended to replace the 'mkdir' command with 'mkdir -p' if it matches a specific pattern. 

1. The test case checks if the new command returned by the get_new_command function matches the expected new command after replacing 'mkdir' with 'mkdir -p'. The function is failing for the test cases involving the 'hdfs dfs' command.

2. The potential error is likely due to the incorrect implementation of the regular expression substitution in the get_new_command function.

3. The bug occurs because the regular expression `^mkdir (.*)` only matches strings that start with 'mkdir' followed by a space and any other characters. However, it doesn't match the 'hdfs dfs -mkdir' string because it does not start with 'mkdir'.

4. To fix the bug, the regular expression should be modified to match any string that ends with 'mkdir' followed by optional spaces and then any characters. This will allow it to match 'hdfs dfs -mkdir' as well.

5. Here's the corrected code for the get_new_command function:

```python
import re

def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub(r'mkdir(\s+|$)', 'mkdir -p ', command.script)
```
