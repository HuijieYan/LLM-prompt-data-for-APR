The problematic function is `get_new_command(command, settings)`.

The function is using `re.sub` to replace the command but it is only adding `-p` in the command, not replacing 'mkdir' with 'mkdir -p'.

The error message in the test functions is due to the incorrect output of the `get_new_command` function.

To fix the bug, the function needs to replace 'mkdir' with 'mkdir -p' and not just add '-p'.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import re

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_25/thefuck/rules/mkdir_p.py

# this is the corrected function
@sudo_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub(r'^mkdir (.*)', r'mkdir -p \1', command.script)
```
