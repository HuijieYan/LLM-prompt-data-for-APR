Potential error location: The `re.sub` function appears to be incorrectly replacing the entire command `mkdir foo/bar/baz` with `mkdir -p foo/bar/baz`. This would result in an incorrect command format.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `re.sub` function is only replacing the `mkdir` part of the command with `mkdir -p`, which is causing the bug.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
Use a more specific regex pattern to ensure that only the `mkdir` command is replaced with `mkdir -p`.

Corrected code:

```python
import re

@sudo_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub('^(mkdir )', r'\1-p ', command.script)
```
