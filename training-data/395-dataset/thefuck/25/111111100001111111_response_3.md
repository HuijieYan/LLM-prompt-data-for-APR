The buggy function is supposed to add the '-p' flag to the 'mkdir' command if it is not already present. However, the function is incorrectly attempting to access the 'command.script' attribute directly, which is not the correct way to access the script from the 'Command' object. Additionally, the function uses the 'sudo_support' decorator, which is not defined in the provided code.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly access the script from the 'Command' object and also handle the 'sudo_support' decorator.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import re

def sudo_support(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        # Add logic for sudo support if needed
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@sudo_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    if command.script.startswith('mkdir '):
        return command.script.replace('mkdir ', 'mkdir -p ', 1)
    return command.script
```

In the corrected code, we have added a new function `sudo_support` as a placeholder for the actual sudo support logic. Inside the `get_new_command` function, we check if the `command.script` starts with 'mkdir ' and if so, we replace it with 'mkdir -p ' using the `replace()` method. This covers the cases where the 'mkdir -p' command is not present and adds the '-p' flag when needed.
