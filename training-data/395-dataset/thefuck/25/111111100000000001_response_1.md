Potential error location: The re.sub pattern used in the get_new_command function is not correctly replacing the 'mkdir' command with 'mkdir -p'.

Reason for the bug: The regular expression pattern '^mkdir (.*)' does not match the 'mkdir' command properly and does not replace it with 'mkdir -p'.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Modify the regular expression pattern to correctly match and replace the 'mkdir' command with 'mkdir -p'.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_25/thefuck/rules/mkdir_p.py

# corrected function
@sudo_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub('^mkdir (.*)', r'mkdir -p \1', command.script)
```
