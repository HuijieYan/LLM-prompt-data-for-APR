Potential error location: The function is not importing the "re" module and using the "sub" method without it, which will result in an error.

Reason for the bug: The function is trying to use the "re.sub" method without importing the "re" module, which will raise an AttributeError.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Import the "re" module at the beginning of the code.

Corrected code:
```python
import re

@sudo_support
def get_new_command(command, settings):
    return re.sub('^mkdir (.*)', 'mkdir -p \\1', command.script)
```
