The error message indicates an "AttributeError: __enter__" within the "with shelve.open(cache_path) as db" block in the _cache function. This suggests that there is an issue with the shelve.open statement.

The bug is likely occurring because the shelve module is not being used correctly. The issue could be that the cache_path variable is not being set correctly, or that the shelve file is being opened in an incorrect mode.

To fix this bug, the following approaches can be considered:
1. Ensure that the cache_path variable has the correct path and file name for the shelve file.
2. Check that the shelve file is being opened in the correct mode (e.g., 'w' for writing).

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def cache(*depends_on):
    """Caches function result in a temporary file.

    Cache will be expired when the modification date of files from `depends_on` will be changed.

    Function wrapped in `cache` should be argument-agnostic.

    """
    def _get_mtime(name):
        path = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), name)
        try:
            return str(os.path.getmtime(path))
        except OSError:
            return '0'

    def _cache(fn):
        if cache.disabled:
            return fn()

        cache_path = os.path.join(tempfile.gettempdir(), '.thefuck-cache')
        key = '{}.{}'.format(fn.__module__, repr(fn).split('at')[0])

        etag = '.'.join(_get_mtime(name) for name in depends_on)

        with shelve.open(cache_path, writeback=True) as db:
            if db.get(key, {}).get('etag') == etag:
                return db[key]['value']
            else:
                value = fn()
                db[key] = {'etag': etag, 'value': value}
                return value
    return _cache
```
