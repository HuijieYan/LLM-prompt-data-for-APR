The error messages indicate an "AttributeError: __enter__" in the function _cache(). The problem seems to be related to the context manager "with shelve.open(cache_path) as db", where the code is trying to open the 'db' resource and use it within a context manager, but the 'db' resource lacks the __enter__ attribute, causing the AttributeError.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the "shelve.open" function is not being called correctly. It should be called explicitly within the "_cache" decorator function to properly manage the resource.

To fix the bug, the "_cache" decorator function should explicitly open the shelve resource and use it within a context manager with the "with" statement. This will ensure that the resource is properly managed and released after its use.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import shelve

def cache(*depends_on):
    """Caches function result in temporary file.

    Cache will be expired when modification date of files from `depends_on`
    will be changed.

    Function wrapped in `cache` should be arguments agnostic.

    """
    def _get_mtime(name):
        path = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), name)
        try:
            return str(os.path.getmtime(path))
        except OSError:
            return '0'

    def _cache(fn):
        if cache.disabled:
            return fn

        cache_path = os.path.join(tempfile.gettempdir(), '.thefuck-cache')
        key = '{}.{}'.format(fn.__module__, repr(fn).split('at')[0])

        etag = '.'.join(_get_mtime(name) for name in depends_on)

        with shelve.open(cache_path) as db:
            if db.get(key, {}).get('etag') == etag:
                return db[key]['value']
            else:
                value = fn()
                db[key] = {'etag': etag, 'value': value}
                return value
    return _cache
```
