The error appears to be related to the incorrect usage of the `shelve` module and the opening of a cache file within the `_cache` decorator function.

The error message "AttributeError: __enter__" indicates that there is an issue with the context manager's `open` method.

The potential error location is the usage of the `shelve.open` method within the `_cache` decorator function. This function is attempting to use the `shelve.open` method as a context manager, but it seems to be failing due to incorrect usage.

The bug occurred because the `_cache` decorator function is trying to use `shelve.open` as a context manager, but the context management protocol has not been implemented for the `shelve` object being used. This is leading to the "AttributeError: __enter__" when the code is attempting to enter the context.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_cache` decorator function to handle the opening and closing of the shelve file explicitly, rather than relying on the context management protocol. This should ensure that the shelve file is properly accessed.

Here's the corrected code for the `cache` function:

```python
import os
import shelve
import tempfile
from decorator import decorator

def cache(*depends_on):
    """Caches function result in temporary file.

    Cache will be expired when modification date of files from `depends_on`
    will be changed.

    Function wrapped in `cache` should be arguments agnostic.

    """
    def _get_mtime(name):
        path = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), name)
        try:
            return str(os.path.getmtime(path))
        except OSError:
            return '0'

    @decorator
    def _cache(fn, *args, **kwargs):
        if cache.disabled:
            return fn(*args, **kwargs)

        cache_path = os.path.join(tempfile.gettempdir(), '.thefuck-cache')
        key = '{}.{}'.format(fn.__module__, repr(fn).split('at')[0])

        etag = '.'.join(_get_mtime(name) for name in depends_on)

        db = shelve.open(cache_path, writeback=True)
        if db.get(key, {}).get('etag') == etag:
            value = db[key]['value']
        else:
            value = fn(*args, **kwargs)
            db[key] = {'etag': etag, 'value': value}
            db.close()
        return value

    return _cache
```

This correction uses `shelve.open` explicitly and handles the opening and closing of the shelve file within the `_cache` decorator function. Additionally, the `writeback` parameter is set to `True` to ensure changes are flushed back to the file when needed.

These changes should address the "AttributeError: __enter__" issue and make the `cache` function function as intended.
