The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError: __enter__ occurring at line 183 of the function _cache. This suggests that there is an issue with the shelve module's open method, which is causing the error. The code is attempting to use the shelve.open method within a context manager (with statement), but it seems that the shelve module does not support this operation.

The potential reason behind the bug is that the shelve module does not provide support for the with statement, resulting in the AttributeError. This causes the code to fail when attempting to use the shelve.open method within a context manager.

To fix the bug, the shelve.open method can be called directly without using a context manager. Additionally, the cache.disabled check may be incorrect and should be reviewed to ensure it's working as intended.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import os
import shelve
import tempfile

def cache(*depends_on):
    """Caches function result in a temporary file.

    Cache will be expired when the modification date of the files from `depends_on`
    will be changed.

    Function wrapped in `cache` should be arguments agnostic.

    """
    def _get_mtime(name):
        path = os.path.join(os.path.expanduser('~'), name)
        try:
            return str(os.path.getmtime(path))
        except OSError:
            return '0'

    def _cache(fn):
        cache_path = os.path.join(tempfile.gettempdir(), '.thefuck-cache')
        key = '{}.{}'.format(fn.__module__, repr(fn).split('at')[0])

        etag = '.'.join(_get_mtime(name) for name in depends_on)

        if not cache.disabled:
            db = shelve.open(cache_path)
            if db.get(key, {}).get('etag') == etag:
                value = db[key]['value']
            else:
                value = fn()
                db[key] = {'etag': etag, 'value': value}
            db.close()
        else:
            value = fn()

        return value

    return _cache

cache.disabled = False
```
