The error is occurring because the 'info' function is using the 'fish' command with the argument '-c' and 'echo $FISH_VERSION' to get the version of the Fish Shell. However, in the test function, the expected output is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', but the actual output is 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'. This is due to the incorrect command being used to fetch the Fish Shell version.

To fix this issue, the function/method needs to be modified to use the correct command to retrieve the version of the Fish Shell. The 'fish' command with the '--version' argument should be used instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION'.

Here's the corrected 'info' function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extracting the version number
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected function, the 'Popen' command is using 'fish' with the '--version' argument to retrieve the version of the Fish Shell. The version number is then extracted and returned in the correct format. This will provide the expected output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' as mentioned in the test function.
