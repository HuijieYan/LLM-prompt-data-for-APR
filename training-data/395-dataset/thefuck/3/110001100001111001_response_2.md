The issue with the `info` function is that it is not importing the necessary modules to use `Popen`, `PIPE`, and `DEVNULL`. Additionally, it is not handling the `Popen` object correctly.

To fix this, we need to import the required modules and handle the `Popen` object properly.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
