The error occurs due to the incorrect output format in the `info` function of the `Fish` class. The `info` function is expected to return the shell name and version in a specific format, but it currently returns the version string without appending the shell name.

The bug occurs because the `info` function is not formatting the version string properly before returning it.

To fix the bug, the `info` function needs to concatenate the shell name and version with the correct formatting.

Here's the corrected `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], 
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By adding "Fish Shell" before the `version` string, we ensure that the function returns the correct format as expected by the test case.
