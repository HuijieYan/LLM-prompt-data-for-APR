1. The test case provides the input and expected output values for the `info` method of the `Fish` class. It also indicates that the current implementation is not returning the correct version information.

2. The potential error location is the line `return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)` where the version string might not be correctly formatted.

3. The bug occurs because the `info` method is not formatting the version string correctly. The format 'Fish Shell {}' is not applicable to the output received from the `Popen` command.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `info` method to correctly handle the output from the `Popen` command and format the version string accordingly.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `info` method:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'fish, version {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the method will correctly format the version string as 'fish, version 3.5.9' based on the provided test case. This should resolve the issue with the Fish Shell initialization and ensure that the `info` method returns the correct version information.
