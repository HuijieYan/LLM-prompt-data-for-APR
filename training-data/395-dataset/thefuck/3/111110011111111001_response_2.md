Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the incorrect command used to retrieve the Fish shell version in the `info` method.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `info` method is using the incorrect command (`echo $FISH_VERSION`) to get the Fish shell version. This command is not capturing the correct version format, leading to the test failure and mismatch in expected and actual shell version strings.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Use the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version.

Corrected code for the `info` method:

```python
from subprocess import check_output

class Fish(Generic):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        version = check_output(['fish', '--version']).decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
