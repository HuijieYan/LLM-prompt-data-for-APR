The issue seems to stem from the `info` function within the `Fish` class. The function is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running `echo $FISH_VERSION` in a subprocess, but it's using `thefuck` instead of `fish`. This causes a recursive loop when TheFuck plugin uses `thefuck -v` to regenerate functions.

To fix the bug, we should modify the subprocess call to directly invoke the `fish` command in the terminal to retrieve the version. Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $version'], 
                 shell=True, 
                 stdout=PIPE, 
                 stderr=DEVNULL, 
                 executable='/bin/bash')
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected code:
1. We use `shell=True` to ensure that the command is run within a shell environment.
2. We use `executable='/bin/bash'` to explicitly specify that we want to run the command using Bash.
3. We also use the variable `$version` instead of `$FISH_VERSION` to directly fetch the Fish shell version.

These changes should address the recursive loop issue when using TheFuck plugin with the Fish shell.
