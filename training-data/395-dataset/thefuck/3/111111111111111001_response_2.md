The error occurs because the 'info' function is not correctly extracting the version from the command output and formatting it with the string 'Fish Shell'.

The problematic part of the code is the line: 
```python
version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
```
This line is not correctly extracting the version number '3.5.9' from the command output 'fish, version 3.5.9'.

To fix this bug, a regular expression can be used to extract the version number from the command output.

Here's the corrected code for the 'info' function:

```python
import re

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'fish --version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = re.search(r'(\d+\.\d+\.\d+)', output).group(1)
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This code uses the regular expression `(\d+\.\d+\.\d+)` to extract the version number from the command output 'fish --version'. The extracted version is then formatted with the string 'Fish Shell' and returned.
