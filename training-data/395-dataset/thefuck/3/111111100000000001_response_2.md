Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the line `version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`, where it tries to read from the stdout of the process and then decode it. 

Reasons behind the bug: The issue might be that the `proc.stdout.read()` call does not return the expected output, leading to an error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
- Check if the process has finished before reading from its stdout.
- Use the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object to read from stdout and stderr instead of directly calling `proc.stdout.read()`.
- Handle any potential errors that might occur during the process execution.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_3/thefuck/shells/fish.py

from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

# class declaration containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
