The potential error in the provided function is that it is not importing the necessary modules such as subprocess, Popen, PIPE, and DEVNULL. This will cause the function to throw NameError or AttributeError when attempting to use these modules.

The bug occurs because the function does not import the necessary modules for it to work, such as subprocess.

To fix this bug, we need to import the necessary modules and modify the function to properly use the subprocess module to execute the shell command and retrieve the Fish shell version.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With these changes, the function should now work correctly and return the name and version of the Fish shell.
