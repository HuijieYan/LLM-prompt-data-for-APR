The test case is trying to verify that calling the `info` method of the `Fish` class returns the expected string, 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'. However, the actual output from the method call is 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'.

The problem is in the `info` method of the `Fish` class. The issue is that the command being used to retrieve the version of Fish shell is incorrect. The `Popen` call is using `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`, but it should be `['fish', '--version']`.

The correct approach is to modify the Popen call to retrieve the Fish shell version using the correct command.

Here's the corrected method:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

By using the `['fish', '--version']` command, the method will return the expected output, and the test case should pass.
