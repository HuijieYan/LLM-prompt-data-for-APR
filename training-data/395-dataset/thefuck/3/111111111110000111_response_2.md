1. The test case `test_info` is calling the `info` method of the `Fish` class and asserting that it should return 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'. However, the actual result is 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'. 

2. The potential error in the `info` method is the command used to get the fish version, which is `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`. This command is not returning the version string in the correct format.

3. The reason for the bug is that the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` is not providing the desired output format. This is causing the version string to be returned in an unexpected format, leading to the assertion error in the test case.

4. To fix the bug, the command used to get the fish version needs to be modified to `['fish', '--version']` so that it returns the version string in the correct format.

5. Corrected code for the `info` method:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(' ')[2])
```
