The bug is occurring in the `run` function, where it tries to retrieve the environment variable value using `os.getenv`. The issue arises when the environment variable value contains UTF8 characters, causing the `os.getenv` to fail and return an empty string.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the UTF8 characters in the environment variable value. We can modify the `run` function to check for the existence of the environment variable first, and then retrieve its value using `os.environ.get` instead of `os.getenv`. This will allow us to handle UTF8 characters properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `run` function:

```python
import os

def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
    ret = []
    for term in terms:
        var = term.split()[0]
        if var in os.environ:
            ret.append(os.environ.get(var))
        else:
            ret.append('')
    return ret
```

With this modification, the `run` function will first check if the environment variable exists before retrieving its value. This will ensure that the function can handle UTF8 characters in the environment variable value without causing an error.
