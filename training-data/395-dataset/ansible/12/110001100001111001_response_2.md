The issue with the current function is that it is using the `os.getenv` method to retrieve environment variable values, but it is not handling cases where the environment variables don't exist. This is evident from the fact that the expected values for all test cases are empty lists, while the actual values are not.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the function to handle cases where the environment variables don't exist. We can use a try-except block to catch the `KeyError` that is raised when the environment variable does not exist.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import os

def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
    ret = []
    for term in terms:
        var = term.split()[0]
        try:
            ret.append(os.environ[var])
        except KeyError:
            ret.append('')
    return ret
```

With this correction, the function will check if the environment variable `var` exists, and if it does, it will append its value to the `ret` list. If it doesn't exist, it will append an empty string instead. This aligns with the expected behavior for all the test cases provided.
