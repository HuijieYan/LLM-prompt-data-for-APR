The buggy function `run` has a logic error where it's splitting the `term` by whitespace and then taking the first part to use as a variable to look up in the environment. This is causing issues when the environment variable names contain spaces or are not formatted the way it expects.

The possible fix for this bug is to remove the split and just use the term directly as the variable to look up in the environment. Additionally, the function should include `os` module at the beginning to use `os.getenv`.

Here's the corrected code for the `run` function:

```python
import os

def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
    ret = []
    for term in terms:
        ret.append(os.getenv(term, '')) 

    return ret
```
