The issue with the given function is that it uses `os.getenv` to retrieve the environment variables, but the `os` module is not imported in the function, so it will raise an error. Additionally, the function doesn't take into account the supplied `variables` parameter and the keyword arguments `kwargs`. 

To fix the function, the `os` module should be imported, and the `variables` and `kwargs` parameters should be utilized.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import os  # import the os module

def run(self, terms, variables=None, **kwargs):
    ret = []
    for term in terms:
        if variables and term in variables:
            ret.append(variables[term])  # if the term is in variables, use that value
        else:
            ret.append(os.getenv(term, ''))  # else, get the environment variable

    return ret
```
