The bug in the provided function is that it attempts to split the term using whitespace as the delimiter, but no such delimiter exists. As a result, the function is unable to retrieve the environment variable value based on the first word of the term.

Based on the test case and error message, it is evident that for each test case, the function is unable to retrieve the environment variable value and returns an empty list instead.

To fix the bug, the function should split the term using the "=" character as the delimiter, then retrieve the environment variable value based on the first word obtained after the split.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import os

class LookupModule(LookupBase):
    def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
        ret = []
        for term in terms:
            var = term.split('=')[0]
            ret.append(os.getenv(var, ''))
        return ret
```
