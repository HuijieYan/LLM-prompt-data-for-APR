The buggy function is the `run` method inside the `LookupModule` class. The method attempts to fetch environment variable values and return them in a list. The bug occurs when there are UTF-8 characters in the environment variable values.

The reason for the bug is that the `run` method uses the `split` method on the term without considering the possibility of UTF-8 characters. This causes improper splitting of the term, resulting in incorrect variable names and therefore incorrect environment variable lookups.

To fix the bug, the `run` method should split the term based on spaces and take the first element to ensure correct variable names, accounting for UTF-8 characters.

Here's the corrected code for the `run` method:

```python
import os

class LookupModule(LookupBase):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
        ret = []
        for term in terms:
            var = term.split()[0]
            ret.append(os.getenv(var, ''))
        return ret
```

With this correction, the `run` method will correctly split the term and fetch the environment variable values, accounting for UTF-8 characters and resolving the bug.
