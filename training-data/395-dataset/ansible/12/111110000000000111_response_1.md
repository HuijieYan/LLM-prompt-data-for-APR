The error occurs because the `os.getenv` function is failing to handle UTF-8 characters in the environment variable value. This is likely due to the encoding differences between Python 2.7 and Python 3. 

To fix the bug, we need to decode the environment variable value using the correct encoding. One possible approach is to use the `os.environ` dictionary instead of the `os.getenv` function and decode the value using the `utf-8` encoding.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import os

class LookupModule(LookupBase):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
        ret = []
        for term in terms:
            var = term.split()[0]
            value = os.environ.get(var, '').decode('utf-8')
            ret.append(value)
    
        return ret
``` 

With this fix, the function should now be able to handle UTF-8 characters in the environment variable values without causing an error.
