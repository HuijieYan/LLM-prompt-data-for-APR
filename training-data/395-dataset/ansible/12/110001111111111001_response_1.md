Potential error location: The issue seems to be within the run function of the env.py file. The function is currently only checking for the first word in each term and returning the corresponding environment variable. This might not be the intended behavior, as it does not handle cases where the variable name is not the first word in the term.

Reason for the bug: The current implementation of the run function splits the term based on whitespace and assumes that the environment variable name is the first word. This approach does not consider cases where the variable name might not be the first word or where the term itself contains whitespaces.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Consider using the entire term as the variable name instead of splitting based on whitespace.
2. Handle cases where the intended variable name is not the first word in the term.

Here is the corrected code for the run function:

```python
import os

def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
    ret = []
    for term in terms:
        ret.append(os.getenv(term, ''))

    return ret
```

In this corrected code, the entire term is used as the variable name to retrieve the environment variable, and it will handle cases where the variable name is not the first word in the term. This should address the issues observed in the provided test cases.
