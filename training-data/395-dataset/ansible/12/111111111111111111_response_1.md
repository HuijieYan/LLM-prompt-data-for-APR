The issue is related to the `env` lookup plugin in Ansible failing when the environment variable value contains UTF8 characters. The issue seems to be specific to Python 2.7 and exists since Ansible 2.9.

The main issue in the code is the `run` function inside the `LookupModule` class. The function splits the term and tries to get the environment variable value using `os.getenv`, but it doesn't consider the possibility of the value containing UTF8 characters.

To fix this issue, the `run` function needs to be modified to handle UTF8 characters properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `run` function:

```python
class LookupModule(LookupBase):
    def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
        ret = []
        for term in terms:
            var = term.split()[0]
            value = os.getenv(var, '').decode('utf-8')
            ret.append(value)
        return ret
```

With this modification, the `os.getenv` function returns the environment variable value as bytes, which is then decoded to a Unicode string using UTF-8 encoding. This should resolve the issue with UTF8 characters in the environment variable values.

After making this change, the test cases should pass without any assertion errors.
