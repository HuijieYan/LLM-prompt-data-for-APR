The error is likely occurring due to the use of `os.getenv` which is unable to handle UTF-8 characters in the environment variable values. This is causing the lookup plugin to fail when the environment variable value contains UTF-8 characters.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the UTF-8 characters properly and ensure that they are correctly encoded and decoded.

```python
import os

def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
    ret = []
    for term in terms:
        var = term.split()[0]
        value = os.getenv(var, '').decode('utf-8')
        ret.append(value)

    return ret
```

In the corrected code, the `decode('utf-8')` method is used to handle UTF-8 characters in the environment variable values before appending them to the `ret` list. This should resolve the issue with the lookup plugin failing when encountering UTF-8 characters in the environment variable values.
