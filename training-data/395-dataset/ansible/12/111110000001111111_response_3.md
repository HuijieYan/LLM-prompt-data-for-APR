The bug occurs because the `os` module is not imported in the `LookupModule` class, and the `os.getenv()` function is called without the necessary import.

To fix the bug, we need to import the `os` module at the beginning of the `LookupModule` class.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import os

class LookupModule(LookupBase):

    def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
    
        ret = []
        for term in terms:
            var = term.split()[0]
            ret.append(os.getenv(var, ''))
    
        return ret
```

With this change, the `os` module is properly imported, and the `os.getenv()` function can be used within the `run()` method of the `LookupModule` class to retrieve environment variable values, including those containing UTF-8 characters.
