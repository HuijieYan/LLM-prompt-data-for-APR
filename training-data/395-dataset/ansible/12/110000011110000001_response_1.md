The error is occurring because the `run` method in the `env` lookup plugin is not properly retrieving the environment variables. It is using the wrong method to fetch environment variables and is not handling the case when the environment variable is not found.

To fix this issue, the `os.getenv(var, '')` should be replaced with `os.environ.get(var, '')`. Additionally, a check should be added to ensure that if the environment variable is not found, an empty string should be returned.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import os

def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
    ret = []
    for term in terms:
        var = term.split()[0]
        ret.append(os.environ.get(var, ''))

    return ret
```
