The bug in the `run` function is that it splits the term using the default whitespace delimiter and only takes the first part, which causes issues when the term contains spaces or UTF-8 characters. In the provided test cases, the terms are 'foo', 'equation', 'simple_var', and 'the_var', but the function only takes the first part of each, resulting in 'foo', 'equation', 'simple_var', and 'the_var' respectively. This leads to issues when these values are used to look up environment variables because the full term is not being utilized.

To fix this bug, the `run` function should use the full term as the variable name to look up in the environment. This can be achieved by removing the split operation and directly using the term as the variable name.

Here's the corrected code for the `run` function:

```python
def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
    ret = []
    for term in terms:
        ret.append(os.getenv(term, ''))
    return ret
```

With this change, the function will use the full term as the variable name and correctly look up the corresponding environment variable.
