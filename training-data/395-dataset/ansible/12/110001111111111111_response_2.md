The bug in the provided function `run` is causing it to return an empty list instead of the expected environment variable value. This is because the function splits the term and only considers the first part of the split, resulting in an incomplete variable name.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to properly extract the environment variable name and fetch its value using `os.getenv`.

Here's the corrected code for the `run` function:

```python
import os

def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
    ret = []
    for term in terms:
        ret.append(os.getenv(term, ''))

    return ret
```

In the corrected code, we directly use the entire term from the `terms` list to fetch the environment variable value using `os.getenv`. This will ensure that the complete environment variable name is considered and its value is retrieved correctly.

Once this fix is applied, the test cases should produce the expected results without any errors. The corrected code should resolve the issue related to UTF8 characters and provide the expected environment variable values.
