The issue is in the `run` method of the `LookupModule` class. In the `run` method, it is splitting the input `term` by whitespace, but it is assuming that the environment variable name is always the first part of the split. This assumption is not always valid, especially when the environment variable contains whitespace or special characters.

To fix this issue, instead of splitting the term by whitespace, we can directly use the term as the environment variable name.

```python
# class declaration containing the fixed function
class LookupModule(LookupBase):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the fixed function
    def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
        ret = []
        for term in terms:
            ret.append(os.getenv(term, ''))
    
        return ret
```
