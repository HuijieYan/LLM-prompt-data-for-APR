The buggy function `run` is supposed to retrieve the environment variable value for each term in the `terms` list. However, the code is currently splitting each term and only using the first part, then attempting to retrieve the environment variable value for that part. This is causing the function to return an empty list for each term.

To fix this bug, we need to correct the logic inside the `run` function to properly retrieve the environment variable value for each term without splitting the term.

Explanation of the bug:
The bug occurs because the current code uses `var = term.split()[0]` to split the term and only use the first part to retrieve the environment variable value. This logic is incorrect because the entire term should be used to retrieve the environment variable value, not just the first part.

Approach for fixing the bug:
We need to modify the code to use the entire term to retrieve the environment variable value. We can achieve this by directly using each term in the `os.getenv` function call.

Here's the corrected code for the `run` function:

```python
# corrected run function
import os

def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
    ret = []
    for term in terms:
        ret.append(os.getenv(term, ''))
    return ret
```

With this corrected code, the function will correctly retrieve the environment variable values for each term in the `terms` list and return a list of the environment variable values. This should resolve the issues with the test cases and the associated error messages.
