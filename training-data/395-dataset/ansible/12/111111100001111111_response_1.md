Analyzing the provided buggy function, it seems to be attempting to retrieve environment variable values using `os.getenv(var, '')`. The bug occurs because the function does not handle UTF-8 characters properly, leading to a failure when trying to decode the environment variables that contain such characters. 

A potential error location within the function is the usage of `os.getenv(var, '')`. This function call is not handling UTF-8 characters correctly, which leads to the error message described in the GitHub issue.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `os.getenv` function does not handle UTF-8 characters properly when running with Python 2.7.

To fix the bug, the function can be updated to use Python's `os.environ.get` method, which properly handles UTF-8 characters. The corrected code for the problematic function is provided below:

```python
import os
from ansible.plugins.lookup import LookupBase

class LookupModule(LookupBase):
    
    def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
        ret = []
        for term in terms:
            var = term.split()[0]
            ret.append(os.environ.get(var, ''))
    
        return ret
``` 

This updated code uses `os.environ.get` instead of `os.getenv`, ensuring that UTF-8 characters are handled correctly. This should resolve the bug and allow the function to retrieve environment variable values containing UTF-8 characters without errors.
