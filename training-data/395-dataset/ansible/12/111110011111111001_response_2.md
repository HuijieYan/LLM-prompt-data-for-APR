The bug in the given code is that it splits each term and only picks the first part to look up the environment variable. This causes an issue when the environment variable does not match the term exactly.

To fix the bug, we need to use the entire term to look up the environment variable.

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class LookupModule(LookupBase):
    # ... omitted code ...


    # this is the corrected function
    def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
    
        ret = []
        for term in terms:
            ret.append(os.getenv(term, ''))  # use the entire term to look up the environment variable
    
        return ret
```

By using the entire term when looking up the environment variable, we can ensure that it matches the input term and retrieves the correct environment variable value. This change should fix the bug and make the test cases pass.
