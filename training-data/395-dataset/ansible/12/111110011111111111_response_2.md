The bug in the provided function `run` is that it tries to split the `term` on whitespace and takes the first part as the variable without checking if the term contains any whitespace. This results in incorrect variable names and hence the incorrect environment variable values being retrieved. Additionally, the returned value is an empty string instead of the value for the environment variable.

To fix this bug:
1. We need to ensure that the correct variable name is extracted from the term. This can be done by directly using the term as the variable or splitting the term only if it contains whitespace.
2. The function should return the actual value of the environment variable instead of an empty string.

Here's the corrected `run` function:

```python
import os

class LookupModule(LookupBase):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
        ret = []

        for term in terms:
            var = term
            if ' ' in term:
                var = term.split(' ', 1)[0]
            ret.append(os.getenv(var, ''))

        return ret
```

With the corrected `run` function, the environment variables should be retrieved correctly.
