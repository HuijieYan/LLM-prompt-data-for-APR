The error seems to be in the way the `run` function in the `env.py` file is trying to retrieve environment variables. 

The function should be using the `os` module to get the environment variables. Instead, it seems to be calling the `os.getenv` method without importing the `os` module, which is likely leading to the incorrect behavior.

The correct approach would be to import the `os` module and use the `os.getenv` method to retrieve the environment variables.

Here's the corrected code for the `run` function in the `env.py` file:

```python
import os

class LookupModule(LookupBase):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
        ret = []
        for term in terms:
            var = term.split()[0]
            ret.append(os.getenv(var, ''))
    
        return ret
```
