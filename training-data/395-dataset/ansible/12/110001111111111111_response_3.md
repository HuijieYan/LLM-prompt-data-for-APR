The bug seems to be in the `run` function of the `env` lookup plugin. The function currently retrieves the environment variable value using `os.getenv` but does not handle UTF-8 characters properly, resulting in incorrect behavior when the environment variable value contains UTF-8 characters.

The reason behind this bug is that the `os.getenv` function does not handle UTF-8 characters correctly in Python 2.7.

To fix this bug, the `os.getenv` method should be replaced with `os.environ.get`, which can handle UTF-8 characters properly. Additionally, it's necessary to explicitly decode the UTF-8 characters when retrieving the environment variable value.

Here's the corrected code for the `run` function of the `env` lookup plugin:

```python
import os

def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
    ret = []
    for term in terms:
        var = term.split()[0]
        value = os.environ.get(var, '').decode('utf-8')
        ret.append(value)
    return ret
```

By using `os.environ.get` instead of `os.getenv` and explicitly decoding the UTF-8 characters, the bug related to the UTF-8 characters in the environment variable value should be fixed. This should address the issue reported with the utf8 characters in the variable value and the associated test failures.
