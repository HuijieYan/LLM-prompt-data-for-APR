The error in the `run` function of the `env.py` lookup plugin is caused by the use of the `os` module without importing it. The `os` module is required in order to use the `os.getenv` function, which retrieves the value of the environment variable.

To fix the bug, the `os` module needs to be imported at the beginning of the `env.py` file.

Here's the corrected code for the `run` function:

```python
import os

class LookupModule(LookupBase):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
        ret = []
        for term in terms:
            var = term.split()[0]
            ret.append(os.getenv(var, ''))
    
        return ret
```
