The error message in the test function indicates that the `retval` value is always an empty list, which is not expected. This is most likely due to the `os.getenv` function returning an empty string by default, and if `var` is not found in the environment. 

The bug is in the line `ret.append(os.getenv(var, ''))` where we need to use `os.environ.get(var, '')` instead. 

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is the incorrect usage of the `os.getenv` function. The `os.getenv` function does not have a default value parameter, and thus when the environment variable is not found, it returns an empty string. This results in an incorrect list of return values.

To fix the bug, the correct usage of the `os.environ.get` function should be implemented with a default value parameter. This way, if the environment variable is not found, the default value will be returned.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import os

# class declaration containing the buggy function
class LookupModule(LookupBase):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # the fixed function
    def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
        ret = []
        for term in terms:
            var = term.split()[0]
            ret.append(os.environ.get(var, ''))
        return ret
```
