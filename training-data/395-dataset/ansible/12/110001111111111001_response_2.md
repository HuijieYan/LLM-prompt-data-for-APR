The issue with the provided function is that it does not import the `os` module, which is required to access environment variables. This causes the function to return empty strings instead of the actual environment variable values. To fix this bug, we need to import the `os` module within the function.

Additionally, we also need to handle the case where the environment variable does not exist, in which case the function should return an empty string.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
import os  # Add this line to import the os module

def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
    ret = []
    for term in terms:
        var = term.split()[0]
        env_var = os.getenv(var, '')  # Retrieve the environment variable value or '' if it doesn't exist
        ret.append(env_var)

    return ret
```
