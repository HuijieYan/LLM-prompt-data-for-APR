The error is occurring because the `os.getenv()` function is unable to handle UTF-8 characters properly in Python 2.7. The `os.getenv()` function from the `os` module decodes the environment variable using the ASCII encoding which fails when encountering non-ASCII characters.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `run()` function to handle UTF-8 encoding properly. We can use the `os.environ` dictionary to access environment variables and then manually decode the values using the UTF-8 encoding.

Here's the corrected code for the `run()` function:

```python
import os

class LookupModule(LookupBase):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
    
        ret = []
        for term in terms:
            var = term.split()[0]
            value = os.environ.get(var, '').decode('utf-8')
            ret.append(value)
    
        return ret
```

With this change, the `os.environ.get()` method is used to retrieve the environment variable, and then we manually decode the value using the UTF-8 encoding to handle non-ASCII characters properly. This should fix the bug related to UTF-8 characters in the environment variable value.
