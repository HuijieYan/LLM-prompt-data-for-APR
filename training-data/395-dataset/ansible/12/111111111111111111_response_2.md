The issue stems from the buggy `run` function in the `LookupModule` class, specifically in the way it attempts to retrieve environment variables and populate the `ret` list. The issue is that the function should return the values of the environment variables but currently returns empty strings for all input values.

To fix this bug, the `run` function should correctly retrieve environment variables using the `os.environ.get(var, '')` method and populate the `ret` list with those values. This will ensure that the function returns the correct environment variable values.

The corrected code for the `run` function is as follows:

```python
import os

class LookupModule(LookupBase):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
        ret = []
        for term in terms:
            var = term
            ret.append(os.environ.get(var, ''))

        return ret
```

With this correction, the `run` function will correctly retrieve environment variable values and return them in the `ret` list, addressing the bug and enabling the associated test cases to pass. This fix will also resolve the reported error in the linked GitHub issue.
