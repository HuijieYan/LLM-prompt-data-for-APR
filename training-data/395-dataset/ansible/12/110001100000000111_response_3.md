Potential error location: The issue seems to be related to the use of the `os.getenv` function, which may not handle UTF8 characters properly.

Reasons behind the bug: The `os.getenv` function may not be able to handle UTF8 characters correctly, leading to the error message when the function is used to retrieve environment variables with UTF8 characters.

Approach for fixing the bug: One approach for fixing the bug could be to use the `os.environ.get` function instead of `os.getenv`, as `os.environ.get` supports UTF8 characters.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import os

def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):

    ret = []
    for term in terms:
        var = term.split()[0]
        ret.append(os.environ.get(var, ''))

    return ret
```
