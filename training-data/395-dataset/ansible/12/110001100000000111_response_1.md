Potential error location: The issue seems to originate from the `os.getenv(var, '')` call within the for loop in the `run` method.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `os.getenv` function is not able to handle UTF-8 characters properly when using Python 2.7.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Instead of using `os.getenv`, it would be better to use `os.environ.get` to handle UTF-8 characters properly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import os

class EnvLookupPlugin(object):

    def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
        ret = []
        for term in terms:
            var = term.split()[0]
            ret.append(os.environ.get(var, ''))
        return ret
```
