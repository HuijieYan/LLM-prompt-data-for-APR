The problem with the given function is that it does not import the `os` module, which is needed to access environment variables using `os.getenv()`. Additionally, the function should return an empty string if the environment variable is not found.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import os

def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
    ret = []
    for term in terms:
        var = term.split()[0]
        value = os.getenv(var, '')
        ret.append(value)

    return ret
```
