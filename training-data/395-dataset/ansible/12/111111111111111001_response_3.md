The issue with the provided function is that it attempts to split the term into the variable name and some other value, but it does not handle the cases where the term does not contain a space. In such cases, the entire term should be treated as the variable name.

In the given function, by using `term.split()[0]`, it assumes that the term contains a space and tries to split it. If the term doesn't contain a space, the entire term is treated as the variable, which is not the desired behavior.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the function to handle both cases where the term contains a space and where it doesn't.

The following is the corrected function:

```python
import os

class LookupModule(LookupBase):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):
    
        ret = []
        for term in terms:
            if ' ' in term:
                var = term.split()[0]
            else:
                var = term
            ret.append(os.getenv(var, ''))
    
        return ret
```

In this corrected function, we check if the term contains a space, and if it does, we split it and take the first part as the variable name. If the term does not contain a space, we directly use the entire term as the variable name. This way, the function can handle both cases and should return the expected values.
