The issue seems to be with the `run` method of the `env` lookup plugin. The method is not correctly retrieving the value of environment variables when they contain UTF-8 characters.

The reason for this bug is that the `run` method splits each term by space and assumes that the first part is the environment variable name. However, this approach does not work when the environment variable value contains spaces.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `run` method to correctly parse the environment variable name and retrieve its value using the `os.getenv` function. We also need to ensure that the method handles UTF-8 characters correctly.

Here's the corrected `run` method:

```python
import os

def run(terms, variables, **kwargs):
    ret = []
    for term in terms:
        env_var = term.strip()
        ret.append(os.getenv(env_var, ''))

    return ret
```

With this fix, the `run` method is now able to correctly retrieve the value of environment variables regardless of their content, including UTF-8 characters.
