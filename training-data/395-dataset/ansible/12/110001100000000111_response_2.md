The potential error location within the problematic function is the "ret.append(os.getenv(var, ''))" line. This line is attempting to retrieve the environment variable value using os.getenv() and appending it to the "ret" list.

The bug occurs because the os.getenv() function does not handle UTF8 characters properly in Python 2.7. This results in an error when attempting to decode the UTF8 characters.

To fix the bug, you can use the os.environ dictionary to access environment variables instead of using os.getenv(). The os.environ dictionary allows for proper handling of UTF8 characters.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import os

def run(self, terms, variables, **kwargs):

    ret = []
    for term in terms:
        var = term.split()[0]
        ret.append(os.environ.get(var, ''))

    return ret
```
