The potential error in the code is in the conditional statement `if "vlan_id" in to_remove`, which is checking if the string "vlan_id" is in the `to_remove` list. However, the intention is to check if the `vlan_id` exists in `to_remove`.

The code is also not handling the case where `to_remove` is an empty list.

To fix the bug, the conditional statement should be modified to check if `vlan_id` exists in `to_remove`. Additionally, we need to handle the case where `to_remove` is empty.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []
    if vlan_id in to_remove:
        return ["no vlan {0}".format(vlan_id)]

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if key == "vlan_id" or value is None:
            continue
        commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    for key in to_remove:
        commands.append("no {0}".format(key))

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```
