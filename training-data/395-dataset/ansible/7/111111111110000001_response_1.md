The test case `test_eos_vlan_replaced` is expecting a list of commands representing the actions to be taken on a VLAN, including setting the name and state, and then replacing the VLAN. However, the actual commands returned by the function are not as expected, resulting in a test failure.

The potential error location within the `generate_commands` function is the logic for handling the `to_remove` dictionary. The current implementation checks for the key "vlan_id" in the `to_remove` dictionary, but it should be checking for the `vlan_id` key in the `to_set` dictionary.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function incorrectly checks for the existence of "vlan_id" in the `to_remove` dictionary instead of the `to_set` dictionary. This can cause the function to return incorrect commands, leading to a test failure.

To fix the bug, the function logic needs to be corrected to correctly identify the "vlan_id" key within the `to_set` dictionary when handling the `to_remove` parameters.

Here's the corrected implementation of the `generate_commands` function:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if key == "vlan_id" or value is None:
            continue

        commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    for key in to_remove:
        if key == "vlan_id":
            commands.append("no vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))
        else:
            commands.append("no {0}".format(key))

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```
