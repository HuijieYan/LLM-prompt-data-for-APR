The error seems to be occurring because the "no" command is added to the commands list in the wrong place. The commands list should be constructed in a specific order: first, the "vlan" command, then the commands to set values, and finally the commands to remove values.

The bug in the code is that the "no" command is being added immediately after the "vlan" command, before other "set" commands. This causes the "no" command to appear in the wrong position in the commands list, leading to the assertion error in the test case.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the "no" command is added after all the "set" commands have been added to the commands list. This can be achieved by separating the construction of the commands list into two separate loops: one for "set" commands and another for "remove" commands.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if value is not None:
            commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    for key in to_remove:
        commands.append("no {0}".format(key))

    return commands
```

With this correction, the "no" commands will always be added after all the "set" commands, ensuring that the commands list is correctly constructed in the required order.
