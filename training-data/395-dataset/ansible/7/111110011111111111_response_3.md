The problem occurs in the generate_commands function, particularly in the for loop that appends "no {key}" to the commands list. This loop is causing the "no name" command to be added, which is not intended.

The reason behind the bug is that the code checks if "vlan_id" is in to_remove, but it should actually be checking if "vlan_id" is in to_set, since the intention is to remove the "vlan_id" key from the to_set dictionary.

To fix the bug, we should modify the if condition to check if "vlan_id" is in to_set. Additionally, we can use a set to keep track of keys that need to be removed to avoid appending "no {key}" multiple times.

Here's the corrected code for the generate_commands function:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []
    keys_to_remove = set()

    if "vlan_id" in to_set:
        keys_to_remove.add("vlan_id")
    
    if "vlan_id" in to_remove:
        return ["no vlan {0}".format(vlan_id)]

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if value is None:
            continue

        commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    for key in to_remove:
        if key not in keys_to_remove:
            commands.append("no {0}".format(key))

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```

With these changes, the function should now properly handle the to_set and to_remove parameters and produce the expected commands list.
