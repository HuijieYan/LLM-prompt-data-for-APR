Based on the error message, it seems that the issue is related to the order of commands in the "commands" list. The test case expects the "no name" command to appear before the "name tenreplaced" command, but the current implementation does not handle this correctly.

The bug occurs because the function only checks if "vlan_id" is in the "to_remove" dictionary, but it should be checking for the key "name" as well. Additionally, the function should insert the "no name" command before the "name tenreplaced" command based on the "to_remove" dictionary.

To fix this bug, the following changes are recommended:
1. Add a condition to check if "name" is in the "to_remove" dictionary, and if so, add the "no name" command to the commands list.
2. Insert the "no name" command before the "name tenreplaced" command in the commands list.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []
    
    if "vlan_id" in to_remove:
        return ["no vlan {0}".format(vlan_id)]

    if "name" in to_remove:
        commands.append("no name")

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if key == "vlan_id" or value is None:
            continue

        commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    for key in to_remove:
        commands.append("no {0}".format(key))

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```

With these changes, the function should now generate the correct commands list, and the test case should no longer encounter the assertion error.
