Potential error location:
The if condition "if 'vlan_id' in to_remove:" is checking for the wrong key. It should be "if vlan_id in to_remove" instead.

Reason for the bug:
The function is incorrectly checking for the presence of "vlan_id" in the to_remove dictionary, which will always evaluate to False. This will cause the function to not correctly handle the removal of the specified VLAN.

Possible approach to fix the bug:
Change the if condition to correctly check for the presence of the vlan_id in the to_remove dictionary.

Corrected code:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []
    if vlan_id in to_remove:
        return ["no vlan {0}".format(vlan_id)]

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if key == "vlan_id" or value is None:
            continue

        commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    for key in to_remove:
        commands.append("no {0}".format(key))

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```
