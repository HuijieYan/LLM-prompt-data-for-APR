The error message indicates that the lists of commands do not match. Specifically, the 'no name' command is included in the result list but not in the expected list.

The potential error location within the function is the part where the 'no' command is being added for items in the 'to_remove' list.

The reason behind the bug is that the 'no' command is not properly handled when generating commands for items in the 'to_remove' list.

One approach to fix the bug is to modify the loop that handles the 'to_remove' list. Instead of adding the 'no' command for every item in the 'to_remove' list, it should only add the 'no' command for items that are not the VLAN ID.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []
    if "vlan_id" in to_remove:
        return ["no vlan {0}".format(vlan_id)]

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if key == "vlan_id" or value is None:
            continue

        commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    for key in to_remove:
        if key != "vlan_id":
            commands.append("no {0}".format(key))

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```
