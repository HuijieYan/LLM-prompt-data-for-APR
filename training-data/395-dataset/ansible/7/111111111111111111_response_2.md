The error occurs because the "to_remove" keys are not being handled correctly in the "generate_commands" function. The function should check if the keys from "to_remove" exist in the "to_set" dictionary, and if so, add the corresponding "no" command to remove them.

The "generate_commands" function needs to be updated to correctly handle the "to_remove" keys. The function should check if the keys from "to_remove" exist in the "to_set" dictionary, and if so, add the corresponding "no" command to remove them. Additionally, the keys from "to_remove" should be excluded during the iteration over "to_set" to prevent redundant commands.

Here's the corrected "generate_commands" function:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if key == "vlan_id" or value is None:
            continue

        commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    for key in to_remove:
        if key in to_set:
            commands.append("no {0}".format(key))

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```

This updated function should handle the "to_remove" keys correctly and generate the expected commands.
