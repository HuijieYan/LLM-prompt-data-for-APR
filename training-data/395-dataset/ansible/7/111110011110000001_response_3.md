The problem in the given buggy function is that it does not handle the case where the "vlan_id" key is in the to_remove list. Additionally, the function is not correctly handling the case where "to_set" is None or where "to_remove" is an empty list.

The bug occurs due to the mishandling of the "to_remove" list. When "vlan_id" is in the "to_remove" list, the function should return a single command to remove the VLAN. However, the function is not handling this scenario correctly. Additionally, if "to_set" is None or "to_remove" is an empty list, the function should return an empty list of commands. This is not being accounted for in the current implementation.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to first check if "to_set" and "to_remove" are truthy. Then, if "vlan_id" is in "to_remove", we can return the command to remove the VLAN. If not, we can generate commands to set the specified attributes and then generate commands to remove any attributes included in the "to_remove" list.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []

    if to_remove and "vlan_id" in to_remove:
        return ["no vlan {0}".format(vlan_id)]

    if to_set:
        for key, value in to_set.items():
            if key == "vlan_id" or value is None:
                continue
            commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    if to_remove:
        for key in to_remove:
            commands.append("no {0}".format(key))

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```
