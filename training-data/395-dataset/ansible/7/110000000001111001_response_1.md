Potential error location: 
The issue is with the condition "if 'vlan_id' in to_remove" as it is checking for the key 'vlan_id' instead of the key vlan_id. 

Reason for the bug:
The condition "if 'vlan_id' in to_remove" is not checking for the correct key vlan_id in the to_remove dictionary. This leads to the incorrect handling of the to_remove dictionary, resulting in missing removal commands for the specified keys.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Change the condition to "if vlan_id in to_remove" to correctly check for the key vlan_id in the to_remove dictionary.
2. Also, update the loop for appending removal commands to use the correct key from to_remove dictionary.

Corrected code:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []
    if vlan_id in to_remove:
        commands.append("no vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if key == "vlan_id" or value is None:
            continue

        commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    for key in to_remove:
        commands.append("no {0}".format(key))

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```
