The potential error location in the `generate_commands` function is in the loop that iterates through the `to_set` dictionary. The issue arises from the fact that the loop is not correctly checking for whether a key is removed and adding the 'no' command for it.

The bug occurs because the code does not properly handle the case when a key in `to_set` dictionary is also present in `to_remove`. As a result, the 'no' command for the key in `to_remove` is not added to the commands list.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the loop that iterates through the `to_set` dictionary to add the 'no' command for any key that is also present in `to_remove`.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_commands` function:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if key == "vlan_id" or value is None:
            continue
        if key in to_remove:
            commands.append("no {0}".format(key))
        commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    for key in to_remove:
        commands.append("no {0}".format(key))

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```

With this fix, the function will correctly add the 'no' command for any key present in `to_remove` before adding the new command for that key in `to_set`. This will ensure that the commands list contains the correct commands to execute.
