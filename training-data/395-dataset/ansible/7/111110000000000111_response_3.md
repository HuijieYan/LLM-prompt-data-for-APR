The potential error in the provided function `generate_commands` is in the if condition `if "vlan_id" in to_remove`. This condition always evaluates to `False` because the variable `to_remove` is a dictionary and it never contains the string "vlan_id".

The reason behind the bug is that the code inside the if statement will never be executed, so the expected command "no vlan {0}".format(vlan_id) will never be generated and returned.

To fix the bug, the if condition should be modified to check if the key "vlan_id" exists in the dictionary `to_remove` instead of checking if the string "vlan_id" is in the dictionary.

Below is the corrected code for the `generate_commands` function:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []

    if "vlan_id" in to_remove:
        commands.append("no vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if key == "vlan_id" or value is None:
            continue

        commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    for key in to_remove.keys():
        commands.append("no {0}".format(key))

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```
