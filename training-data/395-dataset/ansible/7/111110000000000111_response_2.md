The issue seems to be related to the handling of `vlan_id` and other `to_set` parameters in the `generate_commands` function. The user expects the `vlan_id` to take precedence over other keys, but the behavior is not as expected.

Potential Error Location:
The issue might be related to the check for `vlan_id` in the `to_remove` dictionary, as well as the iteration over the `to_set` dictionary.

Reasons for the Bug:
1. The current implementation checks for the existence of "vlan_id" key in `to_remove` but it should instead check for `vlan_id` in the `to_set` dictionary, since `vlan_id` is present in `to_set`.
2. Additionally, the code should skip the "vlan_id" key inside the `to_set` dictionary, but it currently skips the key-value pair where the value is None.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check for the presence of `vlan_id` in the `to_set` dictionary instead of `to_remove`.
2. On the iteration over `to_set` dictionary, skip the key-value pair if the key is "vlan_id", rather than skipping if the value is None.

Corrected Code:
```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []

    if "vlan_id" in to_set:  # Fixing the check for vlan_id
        to_set.pop("vlan_id")  # Removing the vlan_id from to_set

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if value is None:
            continue
        commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    for key in to_remove:
        commands.append("no {0}".format(key))

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```

This corrected code should address the issues mentioned and ensure that the `vlan_id` takes precedence over other keys.
