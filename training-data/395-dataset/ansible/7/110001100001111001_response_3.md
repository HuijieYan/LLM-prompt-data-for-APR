The buggy function `generate_commands` is meant to generate a list of commands for configuring VLANs, based on the input parameters `vlan_id`, `to_set`, and `to_remove`. The function then returns the list of commands.

The issue with the current implementation is that it does not correctly process the `to_remove` input. If the key "vlan_id" is present in the `to_remove` dictionary, the function is intended to return a specific "no vlan" command. However, currently, it checks for "vlan_id" as a key in `to_remove` instead of checking for the value of `vlan_id` as the key.

Additionally, when processing the `to_set` and `to_remove` dictionaries, the code does not ensure that it appends "no" for the commands specified in `to_remove`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []

    if vlan_id in to_remove.values():
        commands.append("no vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if key == "vlan_id" or value is None:
            continue
        commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    for key, value in to_remove.items():
        if key == "name":
            commands.append("no name")
        else:
            commands.append("no {0}".format(key))

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```

This corrected version of the function checks for the value of `vlan_id` in the `to_remove` dictionary and appends "no" for the commands specified in `to_remove`.
