The issue seems to be with the logic for removing keys from the `to_set` dictionary. The function is incorrectly removing keys from `to_set` based on the `to_remove` dictionary, which is causing unexpected behavior. 

Instead of removing keys from `to_set`, the function needs to remove keys directly from the `commands` list. 

Here is the corrected function:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if key == "vlan_id" or value is None:
            continue
        commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    for key in to_remove:
        commands.append("no {0}".format(key))

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```

This corrected function will properly handle the `to_set` and `to_remove` dictionaries and should address the issue raised in the bug report.
