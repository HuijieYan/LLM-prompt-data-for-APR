The bug is occurring in the `generate_commands` function, specifically in the condition `if "vlan_id" in to_remove`. This condition is checking if the key "vlan_id" exists in the `to_remove` dictionary, but it should be checking if the key `vlan_id` exists in the keys of `to_remove` instead.

The reason for the bug is that the condition is incorrectly checking for the presence of the string "vlan_id" in the `to_remove` dictionary, rather than checking for the presence of the key "vlan_id". This leads to incorrect behavior when trying to remove the "vlan_id" from the commands.

To fix the bug, the condition `if "vlan_id" in to_remove` should be changed to `if "vlan_id" in to_remove.keys()` to correctly check for the presence of the key "vlan_id" in the `to_remove` dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_commands` function:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []
    if "vlan_id" in to_remove.keys():
        return ["no vlan {0}".format(vlan_id)]

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if key == "vlan_id" or value is None:
            continue

        commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    for key in to_remove:
        commands.append("no {0}".format(key))

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```
