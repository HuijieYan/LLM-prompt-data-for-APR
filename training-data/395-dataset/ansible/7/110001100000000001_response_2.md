Potential error location: 
The if statement `if "vlan_id" in to_remove:` is checking for the string "vlan_id" within the to_remove dictionary, which is not correct. It should be checking for the vlan_id key instead.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The if statement is incorrectly checking for a string within the dictionary instead of checking for a key within the dictionary.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Change `if "vlan_id" in to_remove:` to `if vlan_id in to_remove:`
2. Use a try-except block to handle the case where vlan_id is not found in to_remove.

Corrected code:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []
    if vlan_id in to_remove:  # Fix: Check for the vlan_id key in the to_remove dictionary
        return ["no vlan {0}".format(vlan_id)]

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if key == "vlan_id" or value is None:
            continue

        commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    for key in to_remove.keys():  # Change to_remove to to_remove.keys() to iterate through keys
        commands.append("no {0}".format(key))

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```
