The potential error location in the code is the `if "vlan_id" in to_remove` condition, where `to_remove` is a list and not a dictionary. 

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the code is checking for "vlan_id" in the list `to_remove` instead of checking for `vlan_id` itself.

To fix the bug, we need to change the condition to `if vlan_id in to_remove` instead of `if "vlan_id" in to_remove`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []
    if vlan_id in to_remove:
        return ["no vlan {0}".format(vlan_id)]

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if key == "vlan_id" or value is None:
            continue

        commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    for key in to_remove:
        commands.append("no {0}".format(key))

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```
