The issue with the function `generate_commands` is that it incorrectly checks for the key "vlan_id" in the `to_remove` dictionary. The correct key to check for is just "vlan". Additionally, the function is incorrectly appending the "no" command for all keys in `to_remove`, even though it should only do so for the "name" key.

The function should instead check for the "vlan" key in `to_remove` and append "no vlan {0}".format(vlan_id) to the `commands` list if "vlan" is in `to_remove`. It should also only append "no name" to `commands` if "name" is in `to_remove`.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_commands` function:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []
    if "vlan" in to_remove:
        commands.append("no vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if key == "vlan" or value is None:
            continue

        commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    if "name" in to_remove:
        commands.append("no name")

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```

With these changes, the "no" commands are only appended for the correct keys in `to_remove`, and the function should now behave as expected.
