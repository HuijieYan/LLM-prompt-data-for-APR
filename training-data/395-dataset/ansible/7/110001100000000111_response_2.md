The error seems to be related to the way the function `generate_commands` is handling the `to_set` and `to_remove` parameters. The user is expecting that if they have a key-value pair with "vlan_id" as the key, it should override any other key-value pairs. However, the current implementation does not account for this behavior.

The bug seems to be occurring due to the "vlan_id" key not properly overriding other key-value pairs as expected. 

To fix this, we should first check if the "vlan_id" key exists in the `to_set` parameter and if it does, it should override any other key-value pairs. Then, we should also make sure that if the "vlan_id" key exists in the `to_remove` parameter, it should remove the entire VLAN and not just the "vlan_id" key.

Here's the corrected code for the `generate_commands` function:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []

    # Check if vlan_id exists in to_set and use it to override any other key-value pairs
    if "vlan_id" in to_set:
        commands.append("vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))
        for key, value in to_set.items():
            if key == "vlan_id" or value is None:
                continue
            commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))
    
    # Check if vlan_id exists in to_remove and remove the entire VLAN if it does
    if "vlan_id" in to_remove:
        return ["no vlan {0}".format(vlan_id)]

    # If "vlan_id" didn't exist in to_set, iterate through to_set normally
    if "vlan_id" not in to_set:
        for key, value in to_set.items():
            if value is None:
                continue
            commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    # Add remove commands for each key in to_remove
    for key in to_remove:
        commands.append("no {0}".format(key))

    return commands
```
