The potential error location within the problematic function is in the for loop that iterates through the "to_set" dictionary. The check for "vlan_id" key within the "to_remove" dictionary is also incorrect.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code is incorrectly checking for "vlan_id" in the "to_remove" dictionary and it is skipping the key "vlan_id" when iterating through the "to_set" dictionary. Additionally, the function is not properly handling the "vlan_id" key.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Change the check from `"vlan_id" in to_remove` to `vlan_id` in `to_remove`.
2. Remove the condition `if key == "vlan_id" or value is None` and instead include a separate check for the "vlan_id" key outside the loop.
3. Add a separate handling for the "vlan_id" key to ensure it is always included when building the commands.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []

    if vlan_id in to_remove:
        commands.append("no vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))
    else:
        commands.append("vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

        for key, value in to_set.items():
            if key != "vlan_id" and value is not None:
                commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

        for key in to_remove:
            commands.append("no {0}".format(key))

    return commands
```
