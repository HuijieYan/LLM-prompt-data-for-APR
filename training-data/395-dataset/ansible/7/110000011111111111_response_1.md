The issue seems to be related to the handling of the `to_remove` dictionary in the `generate_commands` function. The function currently checks if "vlan_id" is in `to_remove`, but it should be checking for the key "vlan_id" instead. Additionally, the function should be iterating over the items in `to_remove` rather than just adding the keys as the current implementation does.

The bug occurs because the code is not correctly handling the `to_remove` dictionary, causing the "no name" command to be added erroneously.

To fix the bug, we need to make the following changes:
1. Change `if "vlan_id" in to_remove` to `if "vlan_id" in to_remove.keys()`.
2. Change the line `for key in to_remove:` to `for key, value in to_remove.items():`.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []
    if "vlan_id" in to_remove.keys():
        commands.append("no vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if key == "vlan_id" or value is None:
            continue
        commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    for key, value in to_remove.items():
        commands.append("no {0}".format(key))

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```

With these changes, the function should now handle the `to_remove` dictionary correctly and produce the expected output for the given test case.
