Potential error location: 
The if statement `if "vlan_id" in to_remove` should be `if vlan_id in to_remove` because we want to check if the vlan_id is present in the list of keys to be removed, not the literal string "vlan_id".

Reason for the bug:
The current code is checking for the presence of the string "vlan_id" in the list of keys to be removed, which is incorrect. It should be checking for the actual vlan_id in the list.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
We need to modify the if statement to correctly check for the presence of the vlan_id in the to_remove list.

Corrected code:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []
    if vlan_id in to_remove:
        return ["no vlan {0}".format(vlan_id)]

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if key == "vlan_id" or value is None:
            continue

        commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    for key in to_remove:
        commands.append("no {0}".format(key))

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```
