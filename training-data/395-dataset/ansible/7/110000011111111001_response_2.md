The bug in the given function is in the if statement checking for "vlan_id" in to_remove. The intention is to check if the key "vlan_id" is in the to_remove dictionary, but the code is actually checking the string "vlan_id" which will never be in the to_remove dictionary. 

This results in the "no vlan {0}".format(vlan_id) command not being added to the commands list when it should be. Additionally, the "no" commands are being appended after the "vlan" command, which is incorrect.

To fix the bug, the "for key in to_remove" loop should be changed to use the "to_remove" dictionary instead. The key should then be inserted into the "no" command format. The order of commands in the list should also be corrected.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []

    if "vlan_id" in to_remove:
        commands.append("no vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if key == "vlan_id" or value is None:
            continue
        commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    for key in to_remove:
        commands.append("no {0}".format(key))

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```
