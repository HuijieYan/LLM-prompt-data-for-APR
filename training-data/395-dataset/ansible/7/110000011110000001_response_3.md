The potential error in the 'generate_commands' function is in the if condition "if "vlan_id" in to_remove", as this condition checks if the string "vlan_id" is in the 'to_remove' list, instead of checking the 'vlan_id' variable value. Also, there is a missing edge case when the 'to_remove' list contains 'vlan_id' but the 'to_set' also contains 'vlan_id', causing inconsistency.

The reason behind the bug is that the function does not handle the 'vlan_id' as a special case and does not appropriately process the 'to_remove' list, leading to incorrect commands being generated.

To fix the bug, I will adjust the if condition to check if the 'vlan_id' should be removed. Additionally, I will modify the generation of commands to handle the special case when 'vlan_id' is in both 'to_set' and 'to_remove' lists.

Here's the corrected code for the 'generate_commands' function:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []

    if vlan_id in to_remove:
        return ["no vlan {0}".format(vlan_id)]

    if "vlan_id" in to_remove and "vlan_id" in to_set:
        to_remove.remove("vlan_id")

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if key == "vlan_id" or value is None:
            continue
        commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    for key in to_remove:
        commands.append("no {0}".format(key))

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```
