Potential error location: 
The line `if "vlan_id" in to_remove` is checking for the string "vlan_id" in the `to_remove` list, but it should be checking for the `vlan_id` variable instead.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The buggy code has a logical error in the `generate_commands` function. It incorrectly checks if the string "vlan_id" is in the `to_remove` list, but it should be checking for the `vlan_id` variable instead.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Change the condition to check for the `vlan_id` variable instead of the string "vlan_id".
2. Consider using a different approach to manage the `to_set` and `to_remove` parameters.

Corrected code:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []

    if vlan_id in to_remove:  # Corrected to check for vlan_id instead of "vlan_id"
        return ["no vlan {0}".format(vlan_id)]

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if key == "vlan_id" or value is None:
            continue

        commands.append("vlan {0} {1}".format(vlan_id, key))  # Modified to include vlan_id

    for key in to_remove:
        commands.append("no vlan {0} {1}".format(vlan_id, key))  # Modified to include vlan_id

    return commands
```
