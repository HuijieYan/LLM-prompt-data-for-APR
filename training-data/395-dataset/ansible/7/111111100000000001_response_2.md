The potential error in the given function is that the condition "if 'vlan_id' in to_remove" is checking if the key "vlan_id" is present in the "to_remove" dictionary, but it should be checking if the value "vlan_id" is present in "to_remove". Additionally, there is a logical error in the "for key in to_remove" loop, as it should be checking for specific keys related to VLAN configuration, not just any key in the dictionary.

The reason behind the bug is that the function is not correctly identifying the keys to remove from the VLAN configuration.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to change the condition "if 'vlan_id' in to_remove" to "if vlan_id in to_remove.values()" and to explicitly specify the keys related to VLAN configuration to be removed in the "for key in to_remove" loop.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []

    if vlan_id in to_remove.values():
        commands.append("no vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if key == "vlan_id" or value is None:
            continue
        commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    for key, value in to_remove.items():
        if value is not None:
            commands.append("no {0}".format(key))

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```
