Potential error location: The issue might be occurring in the `generate_commands` function because the `commands` generated are not in the expected order.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug is occurring because the "no name" command is being inserted after "state suspend" in the generated `commands` list, leading to the inconsistency in the expected vs. actual output.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the "no" commands are appended to the `commands` list after all the "set" commands have been added. This can be achieved by separating the logic for adding "set" commands and "remove" commands.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if key == "vlan_id" or value is None:
            continue
        commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    if "name" in to_remove:
        commands.append("no name")

    if "state" in to_set and to_set["state"] == "suspend":
        commands.append("state suspend")
    elif "state" in to_remove:
        commands.append("no state")

    if commands:
        commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```
