The error stems from the "commands" variable being in an incorrect order in the execute_module function. The bug is occurring in the generate_commands function. It is mainly due to the loop ordering and the condition to check if "vlan_id" is in to_remove instead of using the actual vlan_id.

To fix the bug, we should reorder the generation of the "commands" list and use the correct vlan_id value. Additionally, we need to remove the "vlan_id" key from the to_set dictionary as it is not supposed to be added as a command.

Here's the corrected code for the generate_commands function:

```python
def generate_commands(vlan_id, to_set, to_remove):
    commands = []

    for key, value in to_set.items():
        if key != "vlan_id" and value is not None:
            commands.append("{0} {1}".format(key, value))

    for key in to_remove:
        commands.append("no {0}".format(key))

    commands.insert(0, "vlan {0}".format(vlan_id))

    return commands
```
