The error seems to be occurring in the `join_path` method, which is used to join file paths and is causing the UNC path to not be rendered correctly by the fetch module.

The bug seems to be in the `join_path` method, specifically in the way it handles and joins the file paths. The error message indicates that the path is not found, which suggests that the path manipulation in the `join_path` method is not handling UNC paths correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `join_path` method to properly handle UNC paths.

Here is the corrected code for the `join_path` method:

```python
def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        arg = self._unquote(arg).replace('/', '\\').replace('\\\\', '\\')
        parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\') if a])

    path = '\\\\'.join(parts)  # Use \\\\ for UNC paths
    if path.startswith('\\\\'):  # Check if it's a UNC path
        return path
    return path
```

In the corrected code:
1. We are now using `\\\\` to properly join UNC paths.
2. We are checking if the path starts with `\\\\` to identify it as a UNC path and returning it as is.
