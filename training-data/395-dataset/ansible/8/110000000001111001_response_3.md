Potential error location: The error may be occurring in the section where the backslashes in the input arguments are being replaced with forward slashes and then split. This could be leading to unexpected behavior when joining the parts back together.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug is likely caused by the inconsistent handling of backslashes and forward slashes in the input arguments. Additionally, there may be issues with the use of the `_unquote` method, which is not provided in the given code snippet.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the `os.path.join` function to handle path joining in a more platform-independent way.
2. Use the `os.path.normpath` function to normalize the path and handle backslashes and forward slashes appropriately.

# Corrected code
```python
import os

def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        arg = arg.replace('/', '\\')
        parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\') if a])
    path = os.path.join(*parts)
    if path.startswith('~'):
        return path
    return path
```
