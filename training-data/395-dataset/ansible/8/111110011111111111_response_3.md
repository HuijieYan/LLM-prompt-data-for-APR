The issue here is in the `join_path` function of the `ShellModule` class. This function is meant to join the paths provided in the input arguments, but it is currently not handling UNC paths correctly.

The problem arises from how the function processes the input arguments. It first replaces forward slashes '/' with backslashes '\\', and then splits the string based on backslashes. This causes issues with UNC paths, which have multiple backslashes and are not split correctly. Additionally, the `_unquote` function is not correctly handling UNC paths either.

To fix this bug, we need to handle UNC paths as a special case. When encountering a UNC path (starting with '\\'), we should directly append it to the `parts` list without splitting. Also, we need to correct the `_unquote` function to handle UNC paths properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `join_path` function:

```python
def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        if arg.startswith('\\\\'):
            parts.append(arg)
        else:
            arg = self._unquote(arg).replace('/', '\\')
            parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\') if a])
    path = '\\'.join(parts)
    if path.startswith('~'):
        return path
    return path
```

Correct function preserves the original UNC paths and splits non-UNC paths correctly. With this fix, the `join_path` function should now correctly handle UNC paths and the test case should pass successfully without any assertion errors.
