The potential error location within the `join_path` function is the line `arg = self._unquote(arg).replace('/', '\\')`. It seems that the `_unquote` function is called without passing the `self` parameter.

The reason behind the bug is that the `_unquote` function is an instance method and should be called with the `self` parameter. Since it is not being called with `self`, it is causing an error.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_unquote` function is called with the `self` parameter. This can be done by using `self._unquote(arg)` instead of `_unquote(arg)`.

Here's the corrected code for the `join_path` function:

```python
def join_path(self, *args):
        parts = []
        for arg in args:
            arg = self._unquote(arg).replace('/', '\\')
            parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\') if a])
        path = '\\'.join(parts)
        if path.startswith('~'):
            return path
        return path
```
