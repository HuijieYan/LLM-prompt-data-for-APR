The error seems to be in the `join_path` method of the `ShellModule` class. The error message shows that the expected value contains double backslashes `\\\\` while the actual value contains single backslashes `\`.

The issue is occurring because the function is replacing forward slashes with double backslashes, but it should be replacing them with single backslashes.

To fix this bug, the function should be modified to replace forward slashes with single backslashes, and to also handle the case where there are multiple backslashes in a row.

Here's the corrected code for the `join_path` method:

```python
def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        arg = self._unquote(arg).replace('/', '\\').replace('\\\\', '\\')
        parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\') if a])
    path = '\\'.join(parts)
    if path.startswith('~'):
        return path
    return path
```

With this fix, the function should properly handle the joining of paths and the backslashes, resulting in the correct output for the test case.
