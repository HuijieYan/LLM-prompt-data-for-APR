The error occurs when the expected output of the `join_path` function is compared with the actual output. The error message indicates that the actual output is missing the initial double backslashes ("\\") in the UNC path and has a single backslash instead. 

The potential error in the `join_path` function is the replacement of forward slashes with backslashes and the subsequent joining of the path parts using backslashes. This transformation is causing the removal of double backslashes that are necessary for UNC paths.

To fix this bug, the function should first join the path parts using forward slashes, then replace the forward slashes with double backslashes, and finally handle the case where the path starts with tilde (~). 

Here's the corrected code for the `join_path` function:

```python
def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        arg = self._unquote(arg)
        parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('/') if a])
    path = '/'.join(parts)
    path = path.replace('/', '\\\\')
    if path.startswith('\\\\'):
        return path
    if path.startswith('~'):
        return '\\' + path[1:]
    return '\\' + path
```

This code correctly handles the UNC path and the tilde prefix at the start of the path.
