The bug seems to be related to the incorrect handling of UNC (Universal Naming Convention) paths in the `join_path` method of the `ShellModule` class. UNC paths start with `\\` and are commonly used to specify network locations. 

The current implementation of the `join_path` method splits the path using the backslash (`\`) as a delimiter, but it doesn't handle UNC paths correctly, leading to incorrect rendering of the path.

One approach to fixing the bug is to modify the `join_path` method to handle UNC paths properly by checking if the path starts with `\\` and then replacing the double backslash with a single backslash. Additionally, the method should split the UNC path using the backslash as a delimiter while retaining the first two parts as they represent the server and share. 

Here's the corrected code for the `join_path` method:

```python
def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        if arg.startswith('\\\\'):  # Check if the path is a UNC path
            parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\')[1:] if a])  # Skip the first empty element and retain the remaining parts
        else:
            arg = self._unquote(arg).replace('/', '\\')
            parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\') if a])
    path = '\\'.join(parts)
    if path.startswith('~'):
        return path
    return path
```

With this correction, the `join_path` method should now handle UNC paths correctly and render the path as expected. This will likely resolve the issue related to fetching files from remote servers using UNC paths.
