The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line `arg = self._unquote(arg).replace('/', '\\')`. This line appears to be attempting to perform some kind of URL-unquoting and replacing forward slashes with backslashes, but it seems to be incomplete or incorrect.

The bug occurs because the function is not properly handling the input arguments that represent a UNC (Universal Naming Convention) path. Specifically, it is not taking into account the double backslashes in the UNC path and is incorrectly manipulating the path separators.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the UNC path parts in the `join_path` function. We should split the parts using the double backslash `\\` and then join them using a single backslash `\`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        arg = arg.replace('/', '\\').replace('\\\\', '\\')
        parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\') if a])
    path = '\\'.join(parts)
    if path.startswith('~'):
        return path
    return path
```

With this correction, the function should now properly handle the UNC path parts and join them using the correct separators.
