The bug is likely in the `join_path` function, which is meant to join the input paths into a single path. The bug causes improper handling of input UNC paths, leading to the incorrect formation of the final path.

The issue arises from the incorrect handling of UNC paths, where the function doesn't properly split the input paths into individual components.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to correctly parse and join the UNC paths. This can be achieved by splitting each path component properly and joining them using the correct separator.

Here's the corrected code for the `join_path` method:

```python
def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        arg = self._unquote(arg).replace('/', '\\')
        if arg.startswith('\\\\'):  # Check if it's a UNC path
            parts.extend(arg.split('\\')[2:])  # Skip the host and share parts
        else:
            parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\') if a])
    path = '\\'.join(parts)
    if path.startswith('~'):
        return path
    return path
```

This corrected code properly handles UNC paths by skipping the host and share parts and only adding the remaining components to the final path.
