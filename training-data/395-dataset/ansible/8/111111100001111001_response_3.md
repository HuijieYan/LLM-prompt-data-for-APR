The issue in the `join_path` function arises from the incorrect processing of the input arguments. The `_unquote` method is being called with the 'value' parameter which is not used within the function, and the 'args' parameter is being incorrectly processed to create 'parts'. Additionally, the path is not being properly constructed.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the unnecessary call to `_unquote` and properly process the input arguments to construct the path.

Here's the corrected code for the `join_path` function:

```python
def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\') if a])

    path = '\\'.join(parts)
    if path.startswith('\\\\'):
        return path
    return path
```

This code removes the unnecessary call to `_unquote` and properly processes the input arguments to construct the path. This should resolve the bug and produce the expected output.
