The error in the code lies in the `join_path` method of the `ShellModule` class. The incorrect handling of UNC paths is causing the test case to fail. The use of the `replace` method is modifying the UNC path in an unintended way, and the subsequent logic is not able to handle UNC paths properly.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the handling of UNC paths and ensure that the special backslashes in the UNC paths are preserved. We also need to address the incorrect use of the `_unquote` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `join_path` method:

```python
def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        # Modified to properly handle UNC paths without converting backslashes to regular slashes
        parts.append(arg.replace('/', '\\'))
    path = '\\'.join(parts)
    if path.startswith('\\\\'):
        return path
    return path
```

With this correction, the method should now handle UNC paths correctly and resolve the issue that caused the test case to fail.
