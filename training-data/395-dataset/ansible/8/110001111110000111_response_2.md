The test case `test_join_path_unc` is related to the error message, as it attempts to use the `join_path` method and compares its output with the expected value. The error message indicates that the output of the `join_path` method is different from the expected value.

The potential error location within the `join_path` method is the usage of the `_unquote` method. It seems that the `replace('/', '\\')` operation is being performed on the original `arg` instead of the result of `self._unquote(arg)`.

The bug occurs because the `_unquote` method is not being used correctly. The `replace('/', '\\')` operation should be performed on the result of `self._unquote(arg)` after unquoting the `arg`.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to update the `join_path` method to correctly use the `_unquote` method and perform the `replace('/', '\\')` operation on the result of `_unquote`.

Here's the corrected code for the `join_path` method:

```python
# relative function's signature in this file
def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        unquoted_arg = self._unquote(arg)
        arg = unquoted_arg.replace('/', '\\')
        parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\') if a])
    path = '\\'.join(parts)
    if path.startswith('~'):
        return path
    return path
```

In the corrected code, the `unquoted_arg` variable is used to store the result of `self._unquote(arg)`. Then, the `replace('/', '\\')` operation is performed on `unquoted_arg`. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the `join_path` method produces the expected output.
