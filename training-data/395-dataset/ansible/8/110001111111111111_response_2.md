The issue lies in the `join_path` method of the `ShellModule` class, where the path is not properly handled when working with UNC paths (paths in the format `\\host\share\`). The path should be transformed into a format that correctly represents the UNC path.

The bug occurs because the `join_path` method does not handle UNC paths correctly. When processing the provided tuple of path parts, the method simply replaces forward slashes with backslashes and then joins the parts together without properly handling UNC paths.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `join_path` method to properly handle UNC paths by parsing and joining the path parts in a way that reflects the correct UNC path structure.

Here's the corrected `join_path` method:

```python
def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        arg = arg.replace('/', '\\')
        if arg.startswith('\\\\'):  # Check if it is a UNC path
            parts.extend(arg.split('\\')[2:])  # Add the parts of the UNC path
        else:
            parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\') if a])
    path = '\\\\' + '\\'.join(parts)  # Join the parts back together
    return path
```

This corrected method properly handles UNC paths by checking for the `\\` prefix and adjusting the joining of path parts accordingly. Additionally, it now returns the correct UNC path format. This should solve the issue with handling UNC paths in the `ShellModule` class.
