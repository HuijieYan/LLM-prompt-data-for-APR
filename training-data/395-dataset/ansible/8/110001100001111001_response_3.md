The bug seems to be occurring in the `join_path` function. It is currently unquoting the arguments and replacing `/` with `\`, but it is not handling the network path `\\\\host\\share\\dir1\\dir2` correctly. It also seems to be incorrectly joining the path parts using just the backslash without handling the `~` symbol.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic of the `join_path` function to correctly handle the network path and the tilde symbol.

Here is the corrected code for the `join_path` function:

```python
def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    
    for arg in args:
        if arg.startswith('\\\\'):
            parts.extend(arg.split('\\')[1:])
        else:
            arg = self._unquote(arg).replace('/', '\\')
            parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\') if a])
    
    path = '\\'.join(parts)
    
    if path.startswith('~'):
        path = os.path.expanduser(path)
    
    return path
``` 

In the corrected code:
- We check if the argument starts with `\\`, then we split it using `\\` and extend the `parts` list without the initial empty string.
- Otherwise, we apply the existing logic of unquoting and replacing `/` with `\`.
- After joining the `parts`, we use `os.path.expanduser` to handle the tilde symbol properly. This will expand the `~` to the user's home directory path.

This should correctly handle the input arguments and paths with the expected results.
