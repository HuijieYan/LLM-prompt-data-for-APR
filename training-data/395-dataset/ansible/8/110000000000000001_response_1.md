The potential error in the provided function is with the `_unquote` method, which is called on the argument `arg`. It seems that the `_unquote` method is an instance method, as it uses `self`, so it should be called using `self._unquote`.

The bug occurs because the `_unquote` method is used without being properly defined in the function. This could be the reason behind the error message. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_unquote` method is accessible and properly defined in the class to which this function belongs.

Another potential issue is with handling the backslashes in the 'replace' method. Backslashes in Python strings are used as escape characters, so we need to use double backslashes to represent a single backslash in the replacement string.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        arg = self._unquote(arg).replace('/', '\\\\')
        parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\\\') if a])
    path = '\\'.join(parts)
    if path.startswith('~'):
        return path
    return path
```
