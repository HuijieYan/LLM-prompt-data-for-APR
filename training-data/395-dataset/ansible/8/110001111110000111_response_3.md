The test case `test_join_path_unc` tries to test the `join_path` method of the `ShellModule` class. The method takes a variable number of arguments, representing parts of a file path, combines them, and replaces any "/" characters with "\\".

The error message indicates that the expected path is `'\\\\host\\share\\dir1\\dir2\\dir3\\dir4\\dir5\\dir6'` but the actual path generated by the function is `'host\\share\\dir1\\dir2\\dir3\\dir4\\dir5\\dir6'`. The issue seems to be related to UNC path handling, where the function fails to retain the initial two backslashes at the beginning of the path.

The bug is occurring in the `join_path` method, particularly in the line `path = '\\'.join(parts)`. It seems that the function is not handling UNC paths properly and is stripping the initial double backslashes.

To fix the bug, the `join_path` method should be modified to handle UNC paths correctly by ensuring that the initial double backslashes are retained in the output path.

```python
def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        arg = self._unquote(arg).replace('/', '\\')
        parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\') if a])
    path = '\\\\' + '\\'.join(parts)  # Add double backslashes at the beginning of the path
    if path.startswith('\\\\~'):
        return path
    return path
```
