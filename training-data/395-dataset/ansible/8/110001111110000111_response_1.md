The error appears to be related to joining the UNC path parts in the `join_path` method of the `ShellModule` class. The test case `test_join_path_unc` provides a list of UNC path parts, and the expected result is the joined UNC path.

The issue seems to be within the `join_path` method where it's not properly handling the UNC path parts. The `_unquote` method is also being used, but it's not defined or implemented in the provided code snippet.

The reason behind the bug is that the provided `join_path` method is not correctly handling the joining of UNC path parts. Additionally, the `_unquote` method is being referenced but not defined or implemented in the given code.

To fix the bug, we need to implement the `_unquote` method and modify the `join_path` method to properly handle the joining of UNC path parts.

Here's the corrected code for the `join_path` method:

```python
# corrected join_path method
def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        arg = arg.replace('/', '\\').strip('\\')  # removing leading and trailing backslashes
        parts.append(arg)
    path = '\\'.join(parts)
    if path.startswith('\\\\'):
        return path
    else:
        return '\\' + path  # UNC path needs to start with a double backslash
```
