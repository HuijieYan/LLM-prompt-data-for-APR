Potential Error Location: 

The potential error lies in the line `arg = self._unquote(arg).replace('/', '\\')` inside the for loop. This line is attempting to replace forward slashes with backslashes in the `arg` variable, but it is not handling the case when the `arg` contains double backslashes, as seen in the input parameter value.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:

The code is not handling the case where the input arguments contain double backslashes. This results in incorrect splitting and joining of the path components, leading to an incorrect final path.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:

1. Update the code to handle double backslashes properly when replacing forward slashes with backslashes.
2. Modify the splitting and joining logic to ensure that the path components are correctly processed.

Corrected Code:

```python
def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        # Replace forward slashes with backslashes, handling double backslashes
        arg = self._unquote(arg).replace('\\\\', '/').replace('/', '\\')
        parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\') if a])
    path = '\\'.join(parts)
    if path.startswith('~'):
        return path
    return path
```
