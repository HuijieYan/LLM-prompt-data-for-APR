The issue here seems to be related to the handling of UNC (Universal Naming Convention) paths in the Fetch module. The error message "Path EC2AMAZ-T130RGR\\testshare\\test123.txt is not found" indicates that the path is not being handled correctly when fetching the file from the remote server.

The potential error location within the provided code is the `join_path` method. This method is used to construct a file path by joining multiple path components. The bug occurs when attempting to manipulate UNC paths, leading to incorrect rendering of the path.

The bug occurs because the `join_path` method does not properly handle UNC paths, causing the Fetch module to fail when attempting to fetch files from the remote server.

One possible approach for fixing this bug is to modify the `join_path` method to correctly handle UNC paths. This can be achieved by adding logic to detect and properly manipulate UNC paths within the method.

Here's the corrected code for the `join_path` method:

```python
def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        arg = self._unquote(arg)
        if arg.startswith('\\\\'):  # Check if the path is a UNC path
            parts.append(arg)  # If it is a UNC path, just add it to the parts list
        else:
            arg = arg.replace('/', '\\')
            parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\') if a])
    path = '\\'.join(parts)
    if path.startswith('~'):
        return path
    return path
```

In this corrected code, we first check if the given path is a UNC path. If it is, we simply add it to the `parts` list without any manipulation. If it is not a UNC path, we proceed with the existing logic to replace forward slashes with backslashes and split the path into components. This ensures that UNC paths are handled correctly when constructing file paths.
