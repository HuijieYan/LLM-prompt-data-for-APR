The function `join_path` is designed to take multiple arguments and join them to form a path. However, the bug is causing the function to mishandle UNC paths (Uniform Naming Convention) that start with `\\`. The bug is in the way the function `replace` is being called.

The bug occurs because the `replace` method is used without specifying the string on which it should operate. The call `self._unquote(arg).replace('/', '\\')` should specify the string on which the `replace` method should operate.

To fix the bug, the function should ensure that it handles UNC paths correctly and replaces the backslashes with the correct path separator.

Here's the corrected code for the `join_path` function:

```python
def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        if arg.startswith('\\\\'):  # Handle UNC paths
            arg = arg.lstrip('\\')  # Remove leading backslashes
            parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\') if a])
        else:
            arg = self._unquote(arg).replace('/', '\\')  # Handle regular paths
            parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\') if a])
    path = '\\'.join(parts)
    if path.startswith('~'):
        return path
    return path
```

With this correction, the `join_path` function will now correctly handle both UNC paths and regular paths, and the test case `test_join_path_unc` should pass without any assertion errors.
