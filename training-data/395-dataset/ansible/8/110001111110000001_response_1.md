The error is related to the join_path function in the powershell.py file. The error message indicates that the actual value returned by the function does not match the expected value. The additional backslashes are creating the mismatch.

The potential error location is in the line:
```python
arg = self._unquote(arg).replace('/', '\\')
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the replace('/') method is replacing all instances of forward slashes with backslashes, which is causing additional backslashes to be added in the UNC path.

One approach to fixing the bug is to split the argument using both forward slashes and backslashes, then join the parts with backslashes. This will ensure that there are no additional backslashes added.

Here's the corrected code for the join_path function:

```python
def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        arg = self._unquote(arg)
        parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('/') if a])
        parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\') if a])  # Split using backslashes as well
    path = '\\'.join(parts)
    if path.startswith('~'):
        return path
    return path
```
