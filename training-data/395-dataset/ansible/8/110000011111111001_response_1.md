The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `join_path` function where the backslashes ('\') are being replaced with forward slashes ('/') and then removed from the path instead of properly splitting the path. This is causing the issue with the test case failing.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code is incorrectly manipulating the path by replacing backslashes with forward slashes and then removing them, causing it to incorrectly join the parts.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `join_path` function to properly split the path by backslashes ('\\') and then join them again to form the correct path.

Here's the corrected code for the `join_path` function:

```python
def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        arg = self._unquote(arg)
        parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\') if a])
    path = '\\\\'.join(parts)
    if path.startswith('\\\\'):
        return path
    return '\\\\' + path
```

By making these changes, the function should now properly join the parts of the UNC path and return the expected output.
