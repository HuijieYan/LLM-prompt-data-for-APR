The function `join_path` is intended to join the path parts provided as arguments. The bug seems to be related to the transformation of the UNC (Universal Naming Convention) path during the process.

The test function `test_join_path_unc` creates an instance of the `ShellModule` class and calls the `join_path` method with a list of UNC path parts. The expected output is a properly constructed UNC path, but the actual output seems to have an extra backslash (`\`) at the beginning.

The bug is likely in the line `arg = self._unquote(arg).replace('/', '\\')`. The `replace` method here is replacing forward slashes with backward slashes, but it's not handling the double backslashes in the UNC path properly. Additionally, the `_unquote` method seems to be intended to remove quotes from the path, but it may not be working correctly.

To fix the bug, we should update the `_unquote` method to properly handle the unquoting, and also modify the `replace` method to handle the double backslashes in the UNC path.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class ShellModule(ShellBase):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def _unquote(self, value):
        if value.startswith('"') and value.endswith('"'):
            return value[1:-1]
        return value

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def replace(self, value):
        return value.replace('/', '\\\\').replace('\\\\\\\\', '\\')

    # this is the corrected function
    def join_path(self, *args):
        parts = []
        for arg in args:
            arg = self._unquote(arg)
            arg = self.replace(arg)
            parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\') if a])
        path = '\\'.join(parts)
        if path.startswith('~'):
            return path
        return path
```

The `_unquote` method has been updated to handle unquoting properly, and the `replace` method has been modified to handle the double backslashes in the UNC path. The corrected `join_path` function should now produce the expected UNC path.
