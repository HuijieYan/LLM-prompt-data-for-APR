The error is occurring in the `join_path` method of the `ShellModule` class within the `powershell.py` file. The method is failing to properly handle UNC paths, resulting in an incorrect output.

The issue is that the method is not correctly handling UNC paths with multiple backslashes and mixed forward slashes and backslashes. Additionally, it is not correctly unquoting the path before processing it.

To fix the bug, the function `_unquote` should be called to unquote each path before processing it. Additionally, the function should handle both forward and backward slashes in the input path.

Here's the corrected `join_path` method:

```python
def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        arg = self._unquote(arg).replace('/', '\\').replace('\\\\', '\\')
        parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\') if a])
    path = '\\'.join(parts)
    if path.startswith('~'):
        return path
    return path
```

With this correction, the method will properly handle UNC paths and should return the expected value.
