Potential Error Location: The potential error in the `join_path` function lies in the usage of the `_unquote` method and the manipulation of the file path.

Reason for the Bug: It seems that the `_unquote` method is being used incorrectly or is not functioning as expected. Additionally, there is potential for incorrect manipulation of the file path when replacing forward slashes with backslashes.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug: 
1. Check the implementation of the `_unquote` method and ensure that it is correctly unquoting the input value.
2. Verify that the replacement of forward slashes with backslashes is done correctly without causing any unintended side effects to the file path.
3. Handle the file path manipulation carefully, ensuring that it does not introduce any unexpected behavior.

Corrected Code:
```python
def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        arg = arg.replace('/', '\\')  # Removed the _unquote method as it is causing issues
        parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\') if a])
    path = '\\'.join(parts)
    if path.startswith('~'):
        return path
    return path
```
