The error in the code is caused by the incorrect handling of the input arguments in the join_path function. Specifically, the _unquote method is called on each argument, but the usage of this method is incorrect. Additionally, the path is being created using backslashes even in cases where the original path uses forward slashes.

To fix this bug, the _unquote method should be used on the entire joined path instead of on individual arguments. Additionally, all backslashes should be replaced with forward slashes before splitting the path.

Here's the corrected code for the join_path function:

```python
def join_path(self, *args):
    path = '/'.join(args)
    path = self._unquote(path).replace('/', '\\')
    parts = [a for a in path.split('\\') if a]
    path = '\\'.join(parts)
    if path.startswith('~'):
        return path
    return path
```
