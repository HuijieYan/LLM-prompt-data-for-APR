The error occurs in the `join_path` method of the `ShellModule` class. The `join_path` method is trying to combine file path parts and convert forward slashes into backslashes. However, it is not handling UNC paths correctly, which leads to the assertion error in the test case.

The bug occurs because the `join_path` method does not handle UNC paths properly, and the `_unquote` and `replace` methods are not being utilized effectively.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `join_path` method to handle UNC paths properly and make use of the `_unquote` and `replace` methods effectively.

Here's the corrected code for the `join_path` method:

```python
def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        # removing the redundant replace('/') function call and checking for UNC path
        if arg.startswith('\\\\'):
            parts.append(arg)
        else:
            arg = self._unquote(arg).replace('/', '\\')
            parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\') if a])
    path = '\\'.join(parts)
    if path.startswith('~'):
        return path
    return path
```

With this modification, the `join_path` method now checks if the path starts with `\\\\`, indicating a UNC path, and handles it accordingly. This should fix the issue and allow the test case to pass successfully.
