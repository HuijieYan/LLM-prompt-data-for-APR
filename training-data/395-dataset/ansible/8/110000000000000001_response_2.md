Potential Error Location:
The potential error in this function occurs when the function tries to handle a path starting with "~". The function assumes that if the path starts with "~" then it should be returned as is without any modification. However, this assumption can lead to unexpected behavior when dealing with paths.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The function does not handle the "~" character correctly. The function should handle it as a special case, potentially by expanding it to the user's home directory.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the path starts with "~" and expand it to the user's home directory before further processing.
2. Use platform-specific libraries or methods for handling file paths, as they often provide utility functions for dealing with paths.

Corrected Code:
```python
import os

def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        arg = self._unquote(arg).replace('/', os.path.sep)  # Using os.path.sep to handle platform-specific path separators
        parts.extend([a for a in arg.split(os.path.sep) if a])
    path = os.path.sep.join(parts)
    if path.startswith('~'):
        path = os.path.expanduser(path)  # Expand "~" to the user's home directory
    return path
```
