Potential error location: 
The error is likely occurring in the `join_path` method, specifically in the for loop where it is iterating through the `args` tuple.

Reasons behind the bug: 
The issue seems to be related to the way the `join_path` method handles the path components provided in the `args` tuple. The method is not properly formatting the UNC path and is not handling the special case where the path starts with a tilde (~).

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Apply the `_unquote` function to each path component to handle any quoted values correctly.
2. Split the path components based on both forward and backward slashes and then join them back with escaped backslashes.

Corrected code for the `join_path` method:

```python
def join_path(self, *args):
    parts = []
    for arg in args:
        arg = self._unquote(arg).replace('/', '\\').replace('\\\\', '\\')  # Apply _unquote and handle double backslashes
        parts.extend([a for a in arg.split('\\') if a])
    path = '\\\\' + '\\'.join(parts)  # Prepend with double backslashes for UNC path
    if path.startswith('~'):
        path = path[1:]  # Remove the initial tilde (~)
    return path
```
