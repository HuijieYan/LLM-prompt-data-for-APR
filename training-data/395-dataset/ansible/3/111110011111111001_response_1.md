The error occurs because the expected value for the 'distribution' variable in the test case is 'Kali', but the actual value returned by the function is 'Kali GNU/Linux'.

The bug is likely caused by a discrepancy in the naming convention between the test case expectations and the actual output of the function. The function might be returning a more detailed distribution name, including the edition ("GNU/Linux"), whereas the test case expects a shorter name without the edition.

To fix the bug, the function should return the distribution name without the edition ("GNU/Linux"). Additionally, if the edition is necessary, it should be included as a separate variable, not included in the distribution name itself.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def parse_distribution_file_Debian(self, name, data, path, collected_facts):
    debian_facts = {}
    
    # ... (other omitted code) ...

    # Identifying the distribution without the edition
    if 'Debian' in data:
        debian_facts['distribution'] = 'Debian'
        # Other distribution identification logic

    # ... (other omitted code) ...

    # Return the distribution facts
    return True, debian_facts
```
