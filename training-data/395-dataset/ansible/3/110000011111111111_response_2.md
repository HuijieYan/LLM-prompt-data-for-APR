The bug seems to be related to the comparison of the `distribution` key from the `generated_facts` dictionary. It appears that the expected value in the test case is "Kali," while the actual value in the `generated_facts` dictionary is "Kali GNU/Linux."

This bug was likely caused by the function returning a slightly different distribution name than expected.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the function returns the distribution name in a consistent format.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def parse_distribution_file_Debian(self, name, data, path, collected_facts):
    debian_facts = {}
    if 'Debian' in data or 'Raspbian' in data:
        debian_facts['distribution'] = 'Debian'
        # rest of the code remains the same
        # ...

    return True, debian_facts
```
