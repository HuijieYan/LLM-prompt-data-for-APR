The bug in the provided code is that the `distribution` value is not matching the expected value in the test case. The expected value is 'Kali' but the actual value is 'Kali GNU/Linux'.

The issue occurs because the test case expects the distribution value to be 'Kali' but the function `parse_distribution_file_Debian` returns 'Kali GNU/Linux'.

To fix this issue, we can modify the function to return the distribution value without the 'GNU/Linux' part. This can be achieved by splitting the distribution value and returning the first part.

Here's the corrected code for the `parse_distribution_file_Debian` function:

```python
# class declaration containing the function
class DistributionFiles():
    """
    has-a various distro file parsers (os-release, etc) and logic for finding the right one.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # corrected function
    def parse_distribution_file_Debian(self, name, data, path, collected_facts):
        debian_facts = {}
        if 'Debian' in data or 'Raspbian' in data:
            debian_facts['distribution'] = 'Debian'
            release = re.search(r"PRETTY_NAME=[^(]+ \(?([^)]+?)\)", data)
            if release:
                debian_facts['distribution_release'] = release.groups()[0].split(' ')[0]  # Extract first part of release
                # rest of the code remains unchanged
        # rest of the function remains unchanged
```
