The error occurs in the test because it is expecting the value of the `distribution` variable to be just 'Kali', but the actual value returned from the function is 'Kali GNU/Linux'. This mismatch is causing the assertion error.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the function `parse_distribution_file_Debian()`. The value being returned for the `distribution` variable is not matching the expected value in the test case.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function `parse_distribution_file_Debian()` is returning the distribution name with additional information ('GNU/Linux') which is not accounted for in the test expectation.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the returned value for the `distribution` variable in the `parse_distribution_file_Debian()` function to match what is expected in the test case.

Here's the corrected code for the `parse_distribution_file_Debian()` function:

```python
def parse_distribution_file_Debian(self, name, data, path, collected_facts):
    debian_facts = {}
    if 'Debian' in data or 'Raspbian' in data:
        debian_facts['distribution'] = 'Debian GNU/Linux'  # Adjusted the distribution name to include 'GNU/Linux'
        # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged)
    else:
        return False, debian_facts

    return True, debian_facts
```
