The error message indicates an assertion error in the test function. It's comparing the generated distribution value with the expected value. The expected value is "Kali" but the generated value is "Kali GNU/Linux". This suggests that the `parse_distribution_file_Debian` function is not correctly formatting the distribution value for Kali.

The bug is likely caused by the incorrect formatting of the distribution value in the `parse_distribution_file_Debian` function. It seems that in the case of "Kali", it is setting the distribution to the full description "Kali GNU/Linux" instead of just "Kali".

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `parse_distribution_file_Debian` function correctly formats the distribution value for Kali as "Kali" instead of "Kali GNU/Linux".

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import re

class DistributionFiles():
    """
    has-a various distro file parsers (os-release, etc) and logic for finding the right one.
    """

    # other method definitions

    def parse_distribution_file_Debian(self, name, data, path, collected_facts):
        debian_facts = {}
        if 'Debian' in data or 'Raspbian' in data:
            debian_facts['distribution'] = 'Debian'
            release = re.search(r"PRETTY_NAME=[^(]+ \(?([^)]+?)\)", data)
            if release:
                debian_facts['distribution_release'] = release.groups()[0]
    
            # ... other cases and conditions ...

        elif path == '/etc/lsb-release' and 'Kali' in data:
            debian_facts['distribution'] = 'Kali'
            release = re.search('DISTRIB_RELEASE=(.*)', data)
            if release:
                debian_facts['distribution_release'] = release.groups()[0]
        # ... other conditions ...

        else:
            return False, debian_facts
    
        return True, debian_facts
```

In the corrected function, for the case of "Kali", we are setting the `debian_facts['distribution']` to "Kali" instead of "Kali GNU/Linux". This should resolve the formatting issue and pass the test.
