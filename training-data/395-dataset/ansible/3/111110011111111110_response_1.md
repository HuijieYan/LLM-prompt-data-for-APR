The problem with the code seems to be that the `parse_distribution_file_Debian` function returns the distribution without "GNU/Linux", whereas the test checks for the distribution with "GNU/Linux" included. To fix this, we should update the function to include "GNU/Linux" as part of the distribution name. 

Here's the updated `parse_distribution_file_Debian` function:

```python
import re

class DistributionFiles():
    """
    has-a various distro file parsers (os-release, etc) and logic for finding the right one.
    """

    def parse_distribution_file_Debian(self, name, data, path, collected_facts):
        debian_facts = {}
        if 'Debian' in data or 'Raspbian' in data:
            debian_facts['distribution'] = 'Debian GNU/Linux'  # Include "GNU/Linux" in the distribution name
            release = re.search(r"PRETTY_NAME=[^(]+ \(?([^)]+?)\)", data)
            if release:
                debian_facts['distribution_release'] = release.groups()[0]
    
            # Last resort: try to find release from tzdata as either lsb is missing or this is very old debian
            if collected_facts['distribution_release'] == 'NA' and 'Debian' in data:
                dpkg_cmd = self.module.get_bin_path('dpkg')
                if dpkg_cmd:
                    cmd = "%s --status tzdata|grep Provides|cut -f2 -d'-'", dpkg_cmd
                    rc, out, err = self.module.run_command(cmd)
                    if rc == 0:
                        debian_facts['distribution_release'] = out.strip()
        elif 'Ubuntu' in data:
            debian_facts['distribution'] = 'Ubuntu'
            # nothing else to do, Ubuntu gets correct info from python functions
        # ... Other elif conditions ...
        else:
            return False, debian_facts
    
        return True, debian_facts
``` 

By updating the `distribution` key within the `debian_facts` dictionary to include "GNU/Linux", we ensure that the function conforms to the expected output in the test cases.
