The bug in the `parse_distribution_file_Debian` function is caused by a discrepancy between the expected value and the actual value of the `distribution` key in the `generated_facts` dictionary.

The reason behind this bug might be that the function is not correctly handling the retrieval and formatting of the distribution name. It seems that the function is not taking into account the possibility of additional information included in the distribution name such as "GNU/Linux".

One possible approach to fixing this bug is to update the logic for extracting the distribution name from the input data by considering the cases where additional information might be present.

Here's the corrected code for the `parse_distribution_file_Debian` function:

```python
import re

def parse_distribution_file_Debian(self, name, data, path, collected_facts):
    debian_facts = {}
    
    # Updated logic to extract the distribution name
    if 'Debian' in data or 'Raspbian' in data:
        debian_facts['distribution'] = 'Debian'
        release = re.search(r"PRETTY_NAME=[^(]+ \(?([^)]+?)\)", data)
        if release:
            debian_facts['distribution_release'] = release.groups()[0]

        # ... (rest of the function remains the same)

    return True, debian_facts
```

In the corrected code, the logic for extracting the distribution name has been updated to handle cases where additional information such as "GNU/Linux" is present in the name. This should address the discrepancy between the expected and actual values of the `distribution` key in the `generated_facts` dictionary.
