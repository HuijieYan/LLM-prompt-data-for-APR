The error message shows an assertion failure in the test case related to the `distribution` value. The expected value is 'Kali' but the actual value is 'Kali GNU/Linux', causing the assertion to fail.

Upon reviewing the code for the `parse_distribution_file_Debian` method, it seems that when the distribution is 'Kali', the method is setting the `debian_facts['distribution']` to 'Kali' but is not handling the case where the `debian_facts['distribution_release']` is 'Kali GNU/Linux'. This inconsistency is causing the assertion failure.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to handle the case where the distribution release is 'Kali GNU/Linux' and set the `debian_facts['distribution']` accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def parse_distribution_file_Debian(self, name, data, path, collected_facts):
    debian_facts = {}
    if 'Debian' in data or 'Raspbian' in data:
        debian_facts['distribution'] = 'Debian'
        release = re.search(r"PRETTY_NAME=[^(]+ \(?([^)]+?)\)", data)
        if release:
            debian_facts['distribution_release'] = release.groups()[0]
        
        # other conditions

    elif path == '/etc/lsb-release' and 'Kali' in data:
        debian_facts['distribution'] = 'Kali'
        debian_facts['distribution_release'] = 'Kali GNU/Linux'  # Handle the case for Kali GNU/Linux

        # other conditions

    else:
        return False, debian_facts

    return True, debian_facts
```

In the corrected code, when the distribution is 'Kali', we explicitly set `debian_facts['distribution_release']` to 'Kali GNU/Linux' to maintain consistency with the actual distribution release.
