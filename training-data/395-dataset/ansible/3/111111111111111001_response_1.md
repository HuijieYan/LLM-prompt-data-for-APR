The bug in the given code seems to be related to the comparison of the `generated_facts[key]` and `val` in the test case. It appears that the value of `generated_facts['distribution']` is `'Kali GNU/Linux'` instead of just `'Kali'`, which leads to the assertion error.

The reason for this bug could be that the `parse_distribution_file_Debian` method may be adding additional information to the `distribution` key in the `generated_facts` dictionary. This extra information is not accounted for in the test case's expected value.

To fix this bug, the logic in the `parse_distribution_file_Debian` method needs to be revised to ensure that the `distribution` key only contains the distribution name without any additional information.

Here's the corrected code for the `parse_distribution_file_Debian` method:

```python
# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def parse_distribution_file_Debian(self, name, data, path, collected_facts):
    debian_facts = {}
    if 'Debian' in data or 'Raspbian' in data:
        debian_facts['distribution'] = 'Debian'  # or 'Raspbian' depending on the condition
        release = re.search(r"PRETTY_NAME=[^(]+ \(?([^)]+?)\)", data)
        if release:
            debian_facts['distribution_release'] = release.groups()[0]
        # remove any additional information from the distribution key
        debian_facts['distribution'] = debian_facts['distribution'].split()[0]

    # ... other conditions ...

    return True, debian_facts
```

In this corrected code, after setting the `distribution` key based on the condition, we split the value to remove any additional information.

This approach ensures that the `generated_facts['distribution']` value is consistent with the expected value in the test case, thereby resolving the assertion error.
