The error in the code seems to be related to the regex matching and retrieval of version and release information from the `data` string. The `release` variable is being used to store the result of the `re.search()` method, which is intended to extract the version/release information. However, the `groups()` method is incorrectly being used to access the matched groups. Instead, `group(1)` should be used to access the first group. Additionally, for the Devuan distribution, there is a missing check for the presence of information related to the version in the `data` string.

To fix the bug, the following changes should be made:
1. Update the code to use `group(1)` instead of `groups()[0]` and `version.group(1)` instead of `version.groups()[0]` to access the first matched group.
2. Add a check for the presence of version information for the Devuan distribution before trying to extract the version details.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def parse_distribution_file_Debian(self, name, data, path, collected_facts):
    debian_facts = {}
    if 'Debian' in data or 'Raspbian' in data:
        debian_facts['distribution'] = 'Debian'
        release = re.search(r"PRETTY_NAME=[^(]+ \(?([^)]+?)\)", data)
        if release:
            debian_facts['distribution_release'] = release.group(1)

        # Last resort: try to find release from tzdata as either lsb is missing or this is very old debian
        if collected_facts['distribution_release'] == 'NA' and 'Debian' in data:
            dpkg_cmd = self.module.get_bin_path('dpkg')
            if dpkg_cmd:
                cmd = "%s --status tzdata|grep Provides|cut -f2 -d'-'|cut -f2 -d' ' -f1" % dpkg_cmd
                rc, out, err = self.module.run_command(cmd)
                if rc == 0:
                    debian_facts['distribution_release'] = out.strip()
    elif 'Ubuntu' in data:
        debian_facts['distribution'] = 'Ubuntu'
        # nothing else to do, Ubuntu gets correct info from python functions
    elif 'SteamOS' in data:
        debian_facts['distribution'] = 'SteamOS'
        # nothing else to do, SteamOS gets correct info from python functions
    elif path == '/etc/lsb-release' and 'Kali' in data:
        debian_facts['distribution'] = 'Kali'
        release = re.search('DISTRIB_RELEASE=(.*)', data)
        if release:
            debian_facts['distribution_release'] = release.group(1)
    elif 'Devuan' in data:
        debian_facts['distribution'] = 'Devuan'
        release = re.search(r"PRETTY_NAME=[^(]+ \(?([^)]+?)\)", data)
        if release:
            debian_facts['distribution_release'] = release.group(1)
        version = re.search(r"VERSION_ID=\"(.*)\"", data)
        if version:
            debian_facts['distribution_version'] = version.group(1)
            debian_facts['distribution_major_version'] = version.group(1)

    else:
        return False, debian_facts

    return True, debian_facts
```
