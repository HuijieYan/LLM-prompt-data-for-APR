# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
Write unit tests for validation methods
```

## The associated detailed issue description
```text
SUMMARY
The argument spec validation methods were moved out of basic.py in Ansible 2.8 to make them available for user outside of AnsibleModule. I got several of the unit tests written but not all of them. I'm mainly documenting this here so we can work on them during PyCon 2019 sprints.

ISSUE TYPE
Feature Idea
COMPONENT NAME
lib/ansible/module_utils/common/validation.py

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
There may be a bug in check _type_int() that needs fixing and updating the test. If an bool it returns a bool. This is because Python considers True and False integer_types. It seems wrong to me that check_type_int(False) returns False. This has been the behaviour of this method for quite some time, so changing this could have negative effects.
