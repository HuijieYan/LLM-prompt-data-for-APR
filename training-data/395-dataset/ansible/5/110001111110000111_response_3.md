The test case `test_check_required_arguments_missing_multiple` is checking if the function `check_required_arguments` correctly raises a TypeError with the message "missing required arguments: bar, foo" when the `params` dictionary does not contain the required keys 'bar' and 'foo'.

The error message from the test function indicates that the actual message received is "missing required arguments: foo, bar" instead of "missing required arguments: bar, foo". This suggests that the order of the missing arguments in the error message is not as expected.

The potential error location within the `check_required_arguments` function is in the following line:
```python
msg = "missing required arguments: %s" % ", ".join(missing)
```
This line constructs the error message by joining the missing arguments in the `missing` list. However, the order in which the parameters were added to the `missing` list is not preserved when using `", ".join(missing)`.

The reason behind the bug occurrence is that the missing arguments are added to the list in a different order than the expected order in the error message.

To fix the bug, we can sort the `missing` list before joining it into the error message, to ensure that the parameters appear in the expected order.

Below is the corrected code for the `check_required_arguments` function:

```python
def check_required_arguments(argument_spec, module_parameters):
    """Check all paramaters in argument_spec and return a list of parameters
    that are required but not present in module_parameters

    Raises TypeError if the check fails

    :arg argument_spec: Argument spec dicitionary containing all parameters
        and their specification
    :arg module_paramaters: Dictionary of module parameters

    :returns: Empty list or raises TypeError if the check fails.
    """

    missing = []
    if argument_spec is None:
        return missing

    for (k, v) in argument_spec.items():
        required = v.get('required', False)
        if required and k not in module_parameters:
            missing.append(k)

    if missing:
        missing.sort()  # Sort the missing parameters
        msg = "missing required arguments: %s" % ", ".join(missing)
        raise TypeError(to_native(msg))

    return missing
```

With this correction, the missing parameters will be sorted before being joined into the error message, ensuring that they appear in the expected order.
