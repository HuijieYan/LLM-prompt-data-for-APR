The error occurs in the test function `test_check_required_arguments_missing_multiple` where it expects the error message to be "missing required arguments: bar, foo" but instead receives "missing required arguments: foo, bar". This indicates that the order of the missing arguments in the error message is different from what is expected.

The potential error location is in the `check_required_arguments` function where the `missing` list is created and then directly converted to an error message without ordering the elements.

The bug occurs because the `missing` list is used directly without preserving the order of the missing arguments. As a result, the error message may have a different order of missing arguments than what is expected by the test.

To fix the bug, we need to order the `missing` list before converting it to an error message. We can sort the elements of the `missing` list to ensure that they appear in the expected order in the error message.

Here's the corrected code for the `check_required_arguments` function:

```python
def check_required_arguments(argument_spec, module_parameters):
    """Check all paramaters in argument_spec and return a list of parameters
    that are required but not present in module_parameters

    Raises TypeError if the check fails

    :arg argument_spec: Argument spec dicitionary containing all parameters
        and their specification
    :arg module_paramaters: Dictionary of module parameters

    :returns: Empty list or raises TypeError if the check fails.
    """

    missing = []
    if argument_spec is None:
        return missing

    for (k, v) in argument_spec.items():
        required = v.get('required', False)
        if required and k not in module_parameters:
            missing.append(k)

    if missing:
        missing.sort()  # Sort the missing arguments
        msg = "missing required arguments: %s" % ", ".join(missing)
        raise TypeError(to_native(msg))

    return missing
```

With this correction, the `missing` list is sorted before converting it to an error message, ensuring that the error message will have the missing arguments in the expected order as per the test case.
