The potential error in the function check_required_arguments is in the loop that checks for missing required parameters. It appears to be incorrectly implemented, leading to an incorrect TypeError being raised at the end of the function.

The bug occurs because the loop is not properly checking for missing required parameters. It does not accurately identify which parameters are missing, leading to the incorrect error message being generated.

To fix the bug, we need to properly iterate through the argument_spec and check for missing required parameters. We also need to modify the error message to accurately reflect the missing parameters.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def check_required_arguments(argument_spec, module_parameters):
    """Check all paramaters in argument_spec and return a list of parameters
    that are required but not present in module_parameters

    Raises TypeError if the check fails

    :arg argument_spec: Argument spec dicitionary containing all parameters
        and their specification
    :arg module_paramaters: Dictionary of module parameters

    :returns: Empty list or raises TypeError if the check fails.
    """

    missing = []
    if argument_spec is None:
        return missing

    for (k, v) in argument_spec.items():
        required = v.get('required', False)
        if required and k not in module_parameters:
            missing.append(k)

    if missing:
        msg = "Missing required arguments: %s" % ", ".join(missing)
        raise ValueError(msg)

    return missing
```

In the corrected code, the loop correctly iterates through the argument_spec to check for missing required parameters. The error message is also modified to accurately reflect the missing parameters.
