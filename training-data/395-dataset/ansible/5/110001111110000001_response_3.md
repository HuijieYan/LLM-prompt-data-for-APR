The error occurs in the `test_check_required_arguments_missing_multiple` function, specifically in the assertion. The expected output is "missing required arguments: bar, foo" but the actual output is "missing required arguments: foo, bar", the order of the missing parameters is different.

The potential error location is within the `check_required_arguments` function, specifically in the loop where the missing parameters are appended to the `missing` list. The order in which the missing parameters are added to the list is not controlled, which leads to the difference in order when the list is converted to a string.

The bug stems from the fact that the order in which the missing parameters are appended to the `missing` list is not guaranteed, and when converting the list to a string, the order can change.

To fix this bug, we can sort the `missing` list before converting it to a string. This will ensure that the missing parameters are always in the same order when the string is created.

Here's the corrected code for the `check_required_arguments` function:

```python
def check_required_arguments(argument_spec, module_parameters):
    """Check all paramaters in argument_spec and return a list of parameters
    that are required but not present in module_parameters

    Raises TypeError if the check fails

    :arg argument_spec: Argument spec dicitionary containing all parameters
        and their specification
    :arg module_paramaters: Dictionary of module parameters

    :returns: Empty list or raises TypeError if the check fails.
    """

    missing = []
    if argument_spec is None:
        return missing

    for (k, v) in argument_spec.items():
        required = v.get('required', False)
        if required and k not in module_parameters:
            missing.append(k)

    missing.sort()  # Sort the missing parameters

    if missing:
        msg = "missing required arguments: %s" % ", ".join(missing)
        raise TypeError(to_native(msg))

    return missing
```

With this change, the missing parameters will always be sorted in alphabetical order, ensuring consistency in the error message and resolving the bug.
