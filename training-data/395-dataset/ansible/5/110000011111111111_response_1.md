The error message from the test function indicates that the order of the missing required arguments is not as expected. The test function expects "missing required arguments: bar, foo" but receives "missing required arguments: foo, bar". This suggests that the order of the missing arguments is incorrect in the output of the check_required_arguments function.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the order in which the missing arguments are being appended to the `missing` list.

The bug occurred because the missing arguments are being appended to the `missing` list without considering their order. This leads to the incorrect ordering of the missing arguments when they are later joined into a string.

One approach to fixing this bug is to sort the `missing` list before joining its elements into a string.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def check_required_arguments(argument_spec, module_parameters):
    """Check all paramaters in argument_spec and return a list of parameters
    that are required but not present in module_parameters

    Raises TypeError if the check fails

    :arg argument_spec: Argument spec dicitionary containing all parameters
        and their specification
    :arg module_paramaters: Dictionary of module parameters

    :returns: Empty list or raises TypeError if the check fails.
    """

    missing = []
    if argument_spec is None:
        return missing

    for (k, v) in argument_spec.items():
        required = v.get('required', False)
        if required and k not in module_parameters:
            missing.append(k)

    if missing:
        missing = sorted(missing)  # Sort the missing parameters
        msg = "missing required arguments: %s" % ", ".join(missing)
        raise TypeError(msg)

    return missing
```

The correction involves sorting the `missing` list before joining its elements into a string. This ensures that the missing arguments are always presented in alphabetical order, hence ensuring consistent behavior across different runs of the function.
