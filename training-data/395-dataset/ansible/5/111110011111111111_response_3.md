The error occurs because the order of the missing items in the error message is different from the expected order in the test function. This indicates that the function is not iterating through the argument_spec dictionary in the expected order.

The issue is occurring in the for loop where the function iterates through the items in the argument_spec dictionary. The order in which the items are being appended to the `missing` list is not guaranteed to be consistent with the order of the dictionary.

To fix this issue, we can sort the `missing` list before raising the exception.

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
def check_required_arguments(argument_spec, module_parameters):
    """Check all paramaters in argument_spec and return a list of parameters
    that are required but not present in module_parameters

    Raises TypeError if the check fails

    :arg argument_spec: Argument spec dicitionary containing all parameters
        and their specification
    :arg module_parameters: Dictionary of module parameters

    :returns: Empty list or raises TypeError if the check fails.
    """

    missing = []
    if argument_spec is None:
        return missing

    for (k, v) in sorted(argument_spec.items()):  # Sort the items to iterate in a consistent order
        required = v.get('required', False)
        if required and k not in module_parameters:
            missing.append(k)

    if missing:
        msg = "missing required arguments: %s" % ", ".join(missing)
        raise TypeError(msg)

    return missing
```

By sorting the items when iterating through the argument_spec dictionary, we ensure that the `missing` list contains the missing parameters in a consistent order, thus resolving the issue encountered in the test case.
