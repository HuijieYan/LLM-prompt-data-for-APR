The error occurs in the test case where it is expecting the error message to be "missing required arguments: bar, foo" but the actual error message is "missing required arguments: foo, bar". This indicates that the order of the missing parameters is different than expected. 

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `check_required_arguments` function where the `missing` list is being populated without maintaining the order of the missing parameters.

The bug occurs because the `missing` list is simply being appended with the missing parameters, but the order in which they are added is not being maintained.

To fix the bug, we can use an ordered data structure such as a list to maintain the order of missing parameters.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
def check_required_arguments(argument_spec, module_parameters):
    """Check all parameters in argument_spec and return a list of parameters
    that are required but not present in module_parameters

    Raises TypeError if the check fails

    :arg argument_spec: Argument spec dictionary containing all parameters
        and their specification
    :arg module_parameters: Dictionary of module parameters

    :returns: Empty list or raises TypeError if the check fails.
    """
    missing = []
    if argument_spec is None:
        return missing

    for (k, v) in argument_spec.items():
        required = v.get('required', False)
        if required and k not in module_parameters:
            missing.append(k)

    if missing:
        msg = "missing required arguments: %s" % ", ".join(missing)
        raise TypeError(msg)

    return missing
```

In the corrected function, we are using the list `missing` to maintain the order of missing parameters. This ensures that the error message will display the missing parameters in the correct order.
