The test case 'test_check_required_arguments_missing_multiple' is checking for the missing required arguments 'bar' and 'foo' in the 'params' dictionary. When the test runs, it fails because the order of the missing arguments in the error message is different from the expected message. This indicates that the 'check_required_arguments' function does not return the missing arguments in the expected order.

The potential error location in the problematic function is when the 'missing' list is appended with missing parameters. The order in which the missing parameters are appended to the 'missing' list is not preserved, leading to a different order of missing parameters when the list is joined into an error message.

The bug occurs because the code does not explicitly track the order of the missing parameters as they are identified. As a result, the order in which parameters are found to be missing is not necessarily the same as the order in which they should be reported in the error message.

To fix the bug, we can use an OrderedDict to store the missing parameters, ensuring that their order is preserved. Then, we can construct the error message using the keys of the OrderedDict to maintain the order of missing parameters.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from collections import OrderedDict

def check_required_arguments(argument_spec, module_parameters):
    """Check all paramaters in argument_spec and return a list of parameters
    that are required but not present in module_parameters

    Raises TypeError if the check fails

    :arg argument_spec: Argument spec dicitionary containing all parameters
        and their specification
    :arg module_paramaters: Dictionary of module parameters

    :returns: Empty list or raises TypeError if the check fails.
    """

    missing = OrderedDict()
    if argument_spec is None:
        return list(missing.keys())

    for (k, v) in argument_spec.items():
        required = v.get('required', False)
        if required and k not in module_parameters:
            missing[k] = True

    if missing:
        msg = "missing required arguments: %s" % ", ".join(missing.keys())
        raise TypeError(msg)

    return list(missing.keys())
```

With this corrected function, the missing parameters will be stored in an OrderedDict, ensuring that their order is maintained. Then, the error message is constructed using the keys of the OrderedDict to preserve the correct order.
