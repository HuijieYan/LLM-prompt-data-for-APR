The error occurs in the `_load_collections` method of the `CollectionSearch` class. The function is supposed to load collections, but it has a condition that returns None if the input list `ds` is empty. However, the test case provided expects the list to contain the collection name 'foo.{{bar}}', and it fails the assertion when the list is empty.

The function `_ensure_default_collection` is called with the `collection_list` parameter set to `ds`, which is the input list. It seems that the intention is to add a default collection if the input list is empty, but the current implementation does not do that.

To fix the bug, the `_load_collections` method should ensure that the default collection is added to the input list if it is empty. Additionally, the method should handle the case where the list is not empty and simply return the input list.

Here's the corrected code for the `_load_collections` method:

```python
def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
    if not ds:  # add default collection if ds is empty
        ds.append('default_collection_name')

    return ds
```
