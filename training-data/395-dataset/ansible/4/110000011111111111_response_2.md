The bug occurs because the function `_load_collections` does not parse the values correctly. It attempts to ensure the default collection by calling `_ensure_default_collection` with the value of `ds` as an argument, but since `ds` is expected to be a collection list, this approach is flawed.

Additionally, the function returns `None` when `ds` is empty. However, the expected behavior is to return the `ds` list itself.

To fix the bug, the function should:
1. Check if the list `ds` is empty. If it is, return an empty list.
2. If the list is not empty, return the list itself.

Here's the corrected code for the `_load_collections` function:

```python
def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
    # Ensure the default collection
    if not ds:
        return []

    return ds
```
