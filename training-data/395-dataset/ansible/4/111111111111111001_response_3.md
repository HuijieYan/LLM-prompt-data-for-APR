The issue in the `_load_collections` function is that it does not handle the case where `collection_list` is not None, but still needs to be checked for empty values. The current implementation checks if `ds` is empty, but it does not account for the case where `collection_list` may not be None but still needs to be checked.

The error message in the test function indicates that the warning message is not being printed as expected, which suggests that the code is not correctly identifying the templated collection name.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `_load_collections` function to correctly handle the case where `collection_list` may not be None, but still needs to be checked for empty values.

Here's the corrected `_load_collections` function:

```python
def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
    if ds is None:  # handle the case where ds is None
        return None
    
    if not ds:  # don't return an empty collection list, just return None
        return None
    
    _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds)

    return ds
```

In this corrected function, we first handle the case where `ds` is None and return None. Then we check if `ds` is empty, and if so, we return None. After that, we call the `_ensure_default_collection` function with the `collection_list` parameter to ensure the default collection is set. Finally, we return `ds`.

This correction should address the issue and ensure that the warning message is printed as expected in the test case.
