Potential error location: The potential error in the function is that it is not handling the case where ds is an empty collection list correctly.

Reason behind the bug: The function is supposed to ensure that a default collection is used if the input collection list is empty. However, the current implementation does not handle the empty collection list case properly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We can fix the bug by adding a condition to check if the collection list is empty. If it is empty, we should call the _ensure_default_collection function to get the default collection list.

Corrected code:

```python
def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
    # this will only be called if someone specified a value; call the shared value
    if not ds:  # if collection list is empty, ensure default collection
        ds = _ensure_default_collection()

    return ds
```
