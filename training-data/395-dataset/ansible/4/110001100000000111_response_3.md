The issue is with dynamically loading collections and roles using a variable as part of the collection name. The bug is located in the `_load_collections` method, specifically in the call to the `_ensure_default_collection` method.

The reason for the bug is that the `_ensure_default_collection` method is not being correctly called to ensure that the default collection is loaded before processing the dynamic collection name.

To fix the bug, the `_ensure_default_collection` method needs to be called before processing the dynamic collection name.

Here's the corrected code for the `_load_collections` method:

```python
def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
    # Call the method to ensure default collection is loaded
    self._ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds)

    if not ds:  # don't return an empty collection list, just return None
        return None

    return ds
```
