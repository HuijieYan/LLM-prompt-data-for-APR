The provided GitHub issue does not seem directly related to the buggy function provided. However, the function `_load_collections` appears to be related to loading collections, which might be relevant to the issue.

The potential error location within the `_load_collections` function is the line `_ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds)`. This line seems to be responsible for ensuring that a default collection is called, but it may not be handling the variable collection names correctly.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug are related to how the function handles the collection list and potentially the default collection. It seems that it is not handling variable collection names properly, which may lead to the error described in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the function properly handles variable collection names. This may involve ensuring that the `_ensure_default_collection` function can handle dynamic or variable collection names. The function also needs to handle the case where the collection list is empty and return None accordingly.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function `_load_collections`:

```python
def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
    # check if ds is not empty and call the shared value if someone specified a value
    if ds:
        _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds)
    else:
        return None

    return ds
```

This correction includes handling the case where `ds` is not empty and calling the shared value accordingly, as well as returning None if `ds` is empty.
