Potential error location:
The issue seems to be related to the proper loading of collections using a variable as the collection name. The error message indicates that the role 'role1' was not found, which suggests that there might be an issue with how the collection is being loaded using a variable.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The buggy function `_load_collections` is likely related to the problem. It should handle the loading of collections correctly, particularly when a variable is used as the collection name.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the variable is being correctly substituted with the collection name.
2. Ensure that the correct naming convention and format are used when loading collections with a variable as the collection name.
3. Validate if the variable is being passed as expected when loading collections.

Corrected code:

```python
class CollectionSearch():
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
        # check if the collection name is provided as a variable
        if isinstance(ds, str) and ds.startswith('{{') and ds.endswith('}}'):
            # extract the variable name and get its value
            collection_name = ds[2:-2].strip()
            ds = getattr(self, collection_name, None)

        # this will only be called if someone specified a value; call the shared value
        _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds)

        if not ds:  # don't return an empty collection list, just return None
            return None

        return ds
```

This corrected code handles the case where the collection name is provided as a variable. It extracts the variable name, gets its value, and then uses it to load the collection. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub issue and load the collections correctly even when using a variable as the collection name.
