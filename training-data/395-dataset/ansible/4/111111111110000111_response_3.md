The error message from the test function indicates that the variable `collection_name` is not being correctly processed within the `_load_collections` method of the `CollectionSearch` class. This is also consistent with the reported GitHub issue, where a similar problem is described.

The potential error location within the `_load_collections` method is the line that checks whether the `collection_list` parameter is empty and returns `None` if it is. This behavior may be interfering with the correct handling of the `collection_name` variable.

The bug is likely occurring because the `collection_name` variable is not being properly interpolated within the `collection_list` parameter of the `_ensure_default_collection` function.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to ensure that the `collection_name` variable is properly interpolated before being passed as an argument to `_ensure_default_collection`. This can be achieved by evaluating the template before calling the function.

Here's the corrected code for the `_load_collections` method:

```python
def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
    collection_list = [attr.format(collection_name) for collection_name in ds]
    _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=collection_list)
    
    if not collection_list:  # don't return an empty collection list, just return None
        return None
    
    return collection_list
```

With this correction, the `collection_name` variable will be correctly evaluated and passed to the `_ensure_default_collection` function, allowing for the proper processing of the dynamic collection names.
