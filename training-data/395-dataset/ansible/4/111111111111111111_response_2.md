The issue appears to be with the way the collection name is being handled in the `_load_collections` method of the `CollectionSearch` class. The input parameter `ds` is a list that contains the collection name as well as another string with variable references. 

The bug seems to be related to the fact that the collection name might contain Jinja2 templating which is not being processed correctly.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that any Jinja2 templating within the collection name is resolved before attempting to load the collection. This can be achieved by using the Jinja2 environment (`env`) to render the collection names before loading them.

Here is the corrected code for the `_load_collections` method:

```python
from jinja2 import Template

class CollectionSearch():
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _load_collections(self, attr, ds, env):
        # Render the collection names using the Jinja2 environment
        rendered_ds = [Template(name).render(bar=env.get_template('{{ bar }}')) for name in ds]

        _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=rendered_ds)
    
        if not rendered_ds:  # don't return an empty collection list, just return None
            return None
    
        return rendered_ds
```

This fix involves using the Jinja2 `Template` class to render the collection names before using them. By doing this, any variable references within the collection names will be processed and the correct collection names will be loaded.
