The error occurs because the `_load_collections` function does not handle template variables properly. When the input list `ds` contains a template variable like `'foo.{{bar}}'`, it should be processed and resolved before returning the list. However, the current function simply returns the input list without processing the template variable.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the template variable is processed and resolved before returning the list. We can achieve this by looping through the list and using the Jinja environment to process the template variables.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from jinja2 import Template

def _load_collections(self, attr, ds, env=None):
    if not ds:  # don't return an empty collection list, just return None
        return None

    if env:
        processed_ds = []
        for item in ds:
            template = Template(item)
            processed_item = template.render()
            processed_ds.append(processed_item)
        return processed_ds
    else:
        return ds
```

In this corrected function, we added an additional parameter `env` to handle the Jinja environment. We then loop through the input list `ds`, process each item using the Jinja environment, and append the processed items to a new list `processed_ds`. If the Jinja environment is not provided, the function simply returns the original list `ds`.
