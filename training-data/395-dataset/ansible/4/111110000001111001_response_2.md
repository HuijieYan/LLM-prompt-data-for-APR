The issue with the `_load_collections` function is that it calls `_ensure_default_collection` with the `collection_list` parameter set to `ds` before checking if `ds` is empty. This means that if `ds` is empty, the default collection will still be set to an empty list before being returned. Instead, it should only set the default collection if `ds` is empty.

The corrected code for the `_load_collections` function is as follows:

```python
def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
    if not ds:  # don't return an empty collection list, just return None
        return None
    
    _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds)
    return ds
```
