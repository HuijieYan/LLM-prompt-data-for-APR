The error message in the test function is related to the assertion that checks for a warning message that should be printed when the collection name is templated. The message is not being printed as expected, indicating that the template is not being detected within the `_load_collections` function.

The potential error location is within the `_load_collections` function, specifically in the call to the `_ensure_default_collection` function. The `collection_list` parameter is being passed with the value `ds`, which is a list. However, the `_ensure_default_collection` function is not designed to handle a list as input, leading to unexpected behavior.

The bug occurred because the `_ensure_default_collection` function was not designed to handle a list input, and it seems to be missing some implementation details to handle the input appropriately. Additionally, the input value `ds` is being checked for truthiness, but it's unclear whether this check is necessary or expected in the context of the function.

To fix the bug, the `_ensure_default_collection` function needs to be modified to handle a list input. Additionally, the logic for checking the truthiness of `ds` should be reviewed to ensure it aligns with the expected behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the `_load_collections` function:

```python
def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
    if ds is None or not ds:  # Check for None or empty list
        return None
        
    for collection in ds:  # Assuming ds is a list of collection names
        _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=collection)

    return ds
```
