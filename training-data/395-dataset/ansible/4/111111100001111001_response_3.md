The error occurs when the function `_load_collections` tries to call the function `_ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds)` without checking if `ds` is empty or not.

The bug occurs when the `_load_collections` function is called with an empty list (`ds = []`). The `_ensure_default_collection` function is called with `collection_list` set to `[]` as the argument. This does not match the expected input type for `collection_list`, which is a list of strings representing collection names.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if `ds` is not empty before calling `_ensure_default_collection`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/ansible_4/lib/ansible/playbook/collectionsearch.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=None):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# class declaration containing the corrected function
class CollectionSearch():
    # ... omitted code ...


    # this is the corrected function
    def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
        if ds:  # check if ds is not empty before calling _ensure_default_collection
            _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds)
    
        if not ds:  # don't return an empty collection list, just return None
            return None
    
        return ds
```

Now, the `_ensure_default_collection` function will only be called if `ds` is not empty, and the bug should be fixed.
