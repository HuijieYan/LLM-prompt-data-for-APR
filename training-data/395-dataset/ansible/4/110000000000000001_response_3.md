Potential error location: The function is not handling the case when `ds` is an empty list properly. It should return `None` in this case instead of the empty list.

Reason for the bug: The function does not handle the case when `ds` is an empty list, and it returns the empty list instead of None.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We can modify the function to check if `ds` is empty and return `None` in that case.

Corrected code:

```python
def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
    # this will only be called if someone specified a value; call the shared value
    _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds)

    if not ds:  # don't return an empty collection list, just return None
        return None

    return ds
```
