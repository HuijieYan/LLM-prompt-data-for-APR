# Corrected function/method
```python
# this is the fixed function
def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
    # this will only be called if someone specified a value; call the shared value
    _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds)

    if not ds:  # don't return an empty collection list, just return None
        return None

    return [item for item in ds if item]

```
The function has been corrected to make sure it returns a list of items from the input `ds` that are not empty.
