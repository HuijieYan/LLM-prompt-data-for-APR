The error message is related to the test case `test_collection_static_warning`, which is testing the `_load_collections` method of the `CollectionSearch` class. The method is expected to return the provided `ds` list, but if the list is empty, it should return `None`.

The error occurs because the method is not correctly handling the case when the collection list `ds` is empty. It is trying to ensure the default collection without checking for the empty list condition first. This results in unnecessary function calls and incorrect return values.

To fix the bug, the method `_load_collections` should be modified to first check if the `ds` list is empty and return `None` in that case. Then, the method should ensure the default collection only if a valid `ds` list is provided.

Here's the corrected code for the `_load_collections` method:

```python
class CollectionSearch():
    # ... omitted code ...


    def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
        if not ds:  # if ds is empty, return None
            return None
        
        # ensure the default collection only if ds is not empty
        _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds)

        return ds
```

With this correction, the `_load_collections` method will first check if the collection list `ds` is empty and return `None` in that case. If `ds` is not empty, it will ensure the default collection and return `ds` as expected. This will address the bug and make the function behave correctly.
