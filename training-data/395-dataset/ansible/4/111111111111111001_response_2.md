The error occurs because the `_load_collections` function is not handling the Jinja templating correctly. The input `['foo.{{bar}}']` is a list containing a Jinja template string, and this should not be treated as a collection name.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the Jinja templating is handled properly and that the warning message is displayed when a templated collection name is found.

The corrected code for the problematic function `_load_collections` is as follows:

```python
def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
    if not ds or any('{{' in c for c in ds):  # don't return an empty collection list, just return None
        return None
    else:
        return ds
```

In this corrected code, we added a condition to check if the collection name contains the Jinja templating syntax. If it does, then we return None to indicate that the collection name is not valid. This will trigger the warning message to be displayed.

This change ensures that the Jinja templating is handled properly and that the warning message is displayed when needed.
