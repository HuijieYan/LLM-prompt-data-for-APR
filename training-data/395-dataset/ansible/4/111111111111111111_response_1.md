The issue is occurring because the `_load_collections` function is not properly handling the values passed to it. When a list is passed, it should iterate through each item and ensure the default collection for each item.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_load_collections` function to properly iterate through the `ds` list and ensure the default collection for each item. This will ensure that the roles can be found in the collection.

Here's the corrected code for the `_load_collections` function:

```python
def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
    # iterate through each item in the ds list and ensure the default collection
    for collection in ds:
        _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=collection)

    if not ds:  # don't return an empty collection list, just return None
        return None

    return ds
```

With this correction, the `_load_collections` function will ensure the default collection for each item in the `ds` list, which should resolve the issue with roles not being found in the collection.
