The bug seems to occur due to the use of a variable as part of the collection name in the playbook. The error message indicates that the role 'role1' was not found, which is likely due to the variable not being resolved correctly when trying to load the collection. 

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `_load_collections` method, where the `ds` variable, representing the collection list, is not being updated with the correct value when a variable is used as part of the collection name.

To fix this bug, the `_load_collections` method should correctly handle the variable in the collection name and resolve it to the actual collection name before loading the collections.

Here's the corrected code for the `_load_collections` method:

```python
# corrected function
def _load_collections(self, attr, ds, env, collection_name):
    _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds)
    
    if not ds:  # don't return an empty collection list, just return None
        return None
    
    # Resolve the variable in the collection name to the actual collection name
    resolved_collection_name = env.from_string(collection_name).render()
    ds.append(resolved_collection_name)  # Append the resolved collection name to the collection list
    
    return ds
```

With the corrected code, the `ds` variable is updated to include the resolved collection name before returning the collection list. This should address the issue of the role not being found when using a variable as part of the collection name in the playbook.
