The buggy function `_load_collections` is not correctly handling the case where the input list `ds` contains templated strings. The code only checks if `ds` is empty or not, and if not, it simply returns `ds`. This causes a problem when a templated string is present in the `ds` list.

The error message from the test function indicates that the warning message is not being printed as expected. This could be due to the code not correctly identifying the presence of a templated string in the input.

To fix this bug, the function needs to check if any of the elements in the `ds` list is a templated string, and if it is, print the warning message to stderr.

Here's the corrected code for the `_load_collections` function:

```python
def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
    # this will only be called if someone specified a value; call the shared value
    _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds)

    if not ds:  # don't return an empty collection list, just return None
        return None

    for collection_name in ds:
        if '{{' in collection_name and '}}' in collection_name:
            print('[WARNING]: "collections" is not templatable, but we found: %s' % collection_name, file=sys.stderr)

    return ds
```

In this corrected code, we iterate over each element in the `ds` list and check if it contains the `{{` and `}}` characters, indicating a templated string. If it does, we print the warning message to stderr. Otherwise, we return `ds` as is.
