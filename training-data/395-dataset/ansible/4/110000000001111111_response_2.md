The bug seems to be related to using a variable as the collection name, and it is not being recognized. 

The buggy function `_load_collections` is not handling the variable `ds` correctly. It should be checking for the presence of a placeholder '{{}}' and then replacing it with the actual value before returning the collection name.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_load_collections` function to check for placeholders in the collection name and replace them with the actual value using the `Environment` object.

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
    # this will only be called if someone specified a value; call the shared value
    _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds)

    if not ds:  # don't return an empty collection list, just return None
        return None

    # Check if the collection name contains placeholders
    if '{{' in ds[0] and '}}' in ds[0]:
        # Replace the placeholder with the actual value
        ds[0] = env.from_string(ds[0]).render({"bar": collection_name})

    return ds
```

This modified function will handle the case when the collection name contains a placeholder, replacing it with the actual value before returning the collection name. This should address the issue of the role not being recognized as part of the collection when using a variable as the collection name.
