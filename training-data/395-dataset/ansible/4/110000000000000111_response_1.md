Potential error location:
The issue seems to be related to how the dynamic collection name is being handled. The error message indicates that the role 'role1' was not found, which suggests that the dynamic collection name is not being resolved correctly.

Reason for the bug:
The function `_load_collections` is not adequately handling the dynamic collection name provided as a variable. This results in the role not being found when using the dynamic collection name.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the dynamic collection name is resolved correctly.
2. Check if the variable for the collection name is being passed and utilized properly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
    # this will only be called if someone specified a value; call the shared value
    _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds)

    if ds is None:  # Check if the collection list is empty
        return None
    else:
        return ds
```
