The error occurs in the `test_collection_static_warning` function. The test is checking for a warning message in the standard error output, but it seems that the warning message is not being printed as expected.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `_ensure_default_collection` function call. It seems that the function call is not providing the expected behavior, leading to the warning message not being printed.

The bug occurs because the `_ensure_default_collection` function is being called with `collection_list=ds`, but the `ds` parameter is not being properly handled or initialized. This leads to unexpected behavior and the warning message not being generated.

To fix this, you can modify the `_ensure_default_collection` function to handle the `collection_list` parameter properly and ensure that it has a default value if not provided. Additionally, you can modify the `_load_collections` function to handle the `ds` parameter if it is passed as `None`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# Updated _ensure_default_collection function
def _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=[]):  # Assigning a default value to collection_list
    if not collection_list:  # Checking if collection_list is empty
        # Initialize collection_list with the default value if it's empty
        collection_list = ['default_collection']  # Replace 'default_collection' with the actual default collection
    # ... omitted code ...

# Updated _load_collections function
def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
    # this will only be called if someone specified a value; call the shared value
    _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds)

    if not ds:  # don't return an empty collection list, just return None
        return None

    return ds
```

With these fixes, the `_ensure_default_collection` function now properly handles the `collection_list` parameter, and the `_load_collections` function now handles the `ds` parameter if it is passed as `None`. This should ensure that the warning message is printed as expected in the test case.
