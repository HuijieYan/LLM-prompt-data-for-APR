Potential error location: The _load_collections method inside the collectionsearch.py file

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug seems to be related to using a variable as the collection name in the playbook, which causes the role to not be found. This is likely due to the _load_collections method not handling the dynamic nature of the collection name passed as a variable.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the _load_collections method to handle the dynamic nature of the collection name.
2. Ensure that the _load_collections method correctly resolves the collection name using the variable passed in the playbook.

The corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/ansible_4/lib/ansible/playbook/collectionsearch.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=None):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

class CollectionLoader:
    def _load_collections(self, attr, ds, collection_name):
        # Ensure default collection is set
        _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds)
    
        if not collection_name:  # don't return an empty collection list, just return None
            return None
    
        return collection_name
```
