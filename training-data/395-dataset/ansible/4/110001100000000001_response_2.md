The potential error location within the problematic function is the call to the _ensure_default_collection function. The function call _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds) is attempting to call a non-existent function with an argument 'collection_list', which is not a parameter of the _ensure_default_collection function.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function call is incorrect and does not match the signature of the _ensure_default_collection function.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the incorrect function call and update the _ensure_default_collection function's signature to accept a collection_list parameter.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/ansible_4/lib/ansible/playbook/collectionsearch.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=None):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# this is the corrected function
def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
    if not ds:  # don't return an empty collection list, just return None
        return None

    return ds
```
