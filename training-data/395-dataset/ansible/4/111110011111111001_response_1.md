The test case 'test_collection_static_warning' is trying to check if the collection name 'foo.{{bar}}' is in the list returned by the '_load_collections' function. It then checks if a warning message is printed during the test.

The problem in the '_load_collections' function is that it always returns the input 'ds' parameter, even if it's an empty list. The expected behavior is for it to return the modified 'ds' list.

The bug occurs because the function does not take into account the modification that happens to the 'ds' list before it's returned. In the test case, it expects the modified list to be returned, but the original unmodified list is returned instead.

To fix the bug, the function should return the modified 'ds' list instead of the input 'ds' list.

Here's the corrected code for the '_load_collections' function:

```python
def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
    # this will only be called if someone specified a value; call the shared value
    _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds)

    if not ds:  # don't return an empty collection list, just return None
        return None

    return collection_list
```
