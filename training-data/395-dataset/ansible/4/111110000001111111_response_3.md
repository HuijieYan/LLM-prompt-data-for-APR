The issue is related to using a variable as the name of the collection in Ansible. 

The bug is likely occurring in the `_load_collections` method of the `CollectionSearch` class. The method seems to be validating the input `ds`, and returning `None` if it's empty. However, since the runtime value of `ds` is not empty, the bug must be related to a different part of the code.

Given that the issue is related to using a variable as the name of the collection, it's possible that the `_ensure_default_collection` function is not handling the variable name properly or not resolving it correctly. 

A possible approach to fix this bug is to ensure that the `_ensure_default_collection` function is able to resolve the variable `ds` correctly. This may involve checking for the existence of the collection specified by the variable and handling the variable resolution appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class CollectionSearch():
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
        if not ds:  # don't return an empty collection list, just return None
            return None

        return ds
```
