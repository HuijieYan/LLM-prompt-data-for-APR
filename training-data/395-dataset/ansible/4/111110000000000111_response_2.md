The test case involves using a variable as the collection name in an Ansible playbook, but the role from the collection is not found. Instead, the error message "the role 'role1' was not found" is returned.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `_load_collections` method where the `collection_list` variable is being used. This variable should be replaced with `attr` to correctly call the collection.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `collection_list` variable is not correctly referencing the collection name passed as a variable. As a result, the role from the specified collection cannot be found.

To fix the bug, the `_load_collections` method should be modified to use the `attr` variable to correctly reference the collection name passed as a variable.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the fixed function
class CollectionSearch():
    # ... omitted code ...


    # this is the fixed function
    def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
        # this will only be called if someone specified a value; call the shared value
        _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=attr)
    
        if not attr:  # don't return an empty collection list, just return None
            return None
    
        return attr
```
