The error occurs when trying to include roles from collections in a dynamic manner using a variable as the collection name (e.g. my_namespace.{{ collection_var_name }}.role1). The bug causes the role to not be found, resulting in an error when trying to execute it.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the usage of the variable `ds` without checking if it's a string or a collection. Additionally, the `_ensure_default_collection` function is not correctly handling the default value for the `collection_list` parameter.

To fix the bug, the following approach can be taken:
1. Check if `ds` is a valid collection before proceeding. If it's not a collection, handle it accordingly.
2. Update the `_ensure_default_collection` function to handle the default value for the `collection_list` parameter correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_load_collections` function:

```python
def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
    if not isinstance(ds, list):
        # Handle the case where ds is not a collection
        return None

    _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds)

    if not ds:
        return None

    return ds
```

Additionally, the `_ensure_default_collection` function should be updated to handle the default value for the `collection_list` parameter. However, since the logic for this function is omitted, the specific update cannot be provided without further details on its intended behavior.
