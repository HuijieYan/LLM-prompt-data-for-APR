The provided bug report is not directly related to the given function, but it can be inferred that the bug may be related to how collections are being referenced in the code, which is also the function's purpose.

The potential error location within the function is the call to `_ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds)`. This call seems to be responsible for ensuring that a default collection is used, but it is unclear how the `collection_list` parameter is being used.

The bug may be occurring because the function `_ensure_default_collection` is not handling the variable `ds` correctly when it is empty. This is resulting in the role not being found from the collection.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `ds` is empty by making sure the default collection is loaded, and if `ds` is empty, return the default collection.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
    # this will only be called if someone specified a value; call the shared value
    if ds:
        _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds)
    else:
        _ensure_default_collection()  # Load the default collection if ds is empty

    if not ds:  # don't return an empty collection list, just return None
        return None

    return ds
```

In the corrected code, we first check if `ds` is not empty, and then we call `_ensure_default_collection` with the collection list. If `ds` is empty, we call `_ensure_default_collection` without any parameter to load the default collection. Finally, we return `ds` as it is, if it is not empty.
