The error is related to the handling of the collection name when it is used as a variable (e.g., namespace.{{ collection_name }}). The error message from the test function indicates that the collection name with a templated variable is not being properly processed and is not returning the expected result.

The potential error location is within the `_load_collections` method of the `CollectionSearch` class. The function is not properly handling the case where the collection name contains a templated variable.

The bug occurs because the `_load_collections` method is not resolving the templated collection name correctly, leading to the collection not being found. It fails to handle the scenario where the collection name is dynamic and contain variables.

To fix the bug, the `_load_collections` method needs to be modified to correctly handle the templated collection name and resolve it to the actual collection name before loading the collections.

Here's the corrected code for the `_load_collections` method:

```python
def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
    for collection in ds:
        collection_name = collection if not hasattr(attr, 'collection_name') else attr.collection_name
        _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=collection_name)

    if not ds:  # don't return an empty collection list, just return None
        return None

    return ds
```

In the corrected code, the method iterates through the collection list, resolves the templated collection name using `attr.collection_name` if it exists, and then calls the `_ensure_default_collection` method with the resolved collection name. This ensures that the collection name is properly resolved and the collections are loaded correctly.
