The error seems to be related to using a variable in the collection name, which is not being recognized correctly when trying to import roles from the collection. 

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `_load_collections` method, specifically in the call to `_ensure_default_collection`.

The bug occurs because the `ds` parameter is being passed to `_ensure_default_collection` without actually being checked for its content. The `ds` parameter is expected to have a value, so it should not be checked as a boolean for its existence.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that `_ensure_default_collection` is called only if the `collection_list` parameter is not None. Additionally, the function should return the `ds` list as is, without checking for its existence.

Here is the corrected code for the `_load_collections` method:

```python
def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
    if ds:  # only call _ensure_default_collection if ds is not None
        _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds)

    return ds
``` 

With this correction, the function will only call `_ensure_default_collection` if the `ds` list has a value. It will then return the `ds` list without altering its contents.
