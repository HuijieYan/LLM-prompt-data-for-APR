The error is occurring in the `_load_collections` method. The function is currently returning None if the `ds` parameter is empty. However, based on the test case provided, it seems that it should return the collection list even if it contains the string "foo.{{bar}}" within it.

The bug occurs because the function is not handling the case when the `ds` parameter contains a templated string. It should return the collection list regardless of the contents, and the warning message should be displayed.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_load_collections` method to handle the templated string case properly. It should return the `ds` parameter if it is not empty, and also display the warning message for the templated string.

Here's the corrected code for the `_load_collections` method:

```python
def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
    # this will only be called if someone specified a value; call the shared value
    _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds)

    if not ds:  # don't return an empty collection list, just return None
        return None

    if any('{{' in item and '}}' in item for item in ds):
        print('[WARNING]: "collections" is not templatable, but we found: %s' % ', '.join(item for item in ds if '{{' in item and '}}' in item))

    return ds
```

With this modification, the `_load_collections` method should handle the templated string case correctly and return the collection list even if it contains templated strings.
