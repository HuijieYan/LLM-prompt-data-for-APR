The issue with the provided code seems to be that the `_ensure_default_collection` function is called with the `collection_list` parameter set to `ds`, but if `ds` is not None, the function still returns None.

It looks like the intention of the `_load_collections` function is to first ensure that the `ds` parameter has a default collection, and then return the `ds` parameter if it's not empty.

To fix this, we should ensure that the `_ensure_default_collection` function is not returning None if `ds` is not None.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/ansible_4/lib/ansible/playbook/collectionsearch.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=None):
    # ... omitted code ...
    if collection_list is None:
        collection_list = []
    return collection_list

# this is the corrected function
def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
    ds = _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds)
    
    if not ds:  # don't return an empty collection list, just return None
        return None
    
    return ds
```

In the corrected code, the `_ensure_default_collection` function checks if the `collection_list` parameter is None, and if so, sets it to an empty list. Then, the `ds` parameter is reassigned to the result of the `_ensure_default_collection` function. This ensures that `ds` will not be None when returned by the function.
