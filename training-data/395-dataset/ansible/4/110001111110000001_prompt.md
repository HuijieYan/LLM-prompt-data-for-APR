Please fix the function/method provided below and provide the corrected function/method as the output.


# Buggy function source code
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/ansible_4/lib/ansible/playbook/collectionsearch.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=None):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass



    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def _load_collections(self, attr, ds):
        # this will only be called if someone specified a value; call the shared value
        _ensure_default_collection(collection_list=ds)
    
        if not ds:  # don't return an empty collection list, just return None
            return None
    
        return ds
    
```
