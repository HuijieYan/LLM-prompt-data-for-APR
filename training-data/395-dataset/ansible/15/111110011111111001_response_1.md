The error seems to be related to the incorrect order of commands being generated by the `map_obj_to_commands` function. The test function `test_eos_eapi_vrf` sets the vrf to 'test' and expects a specific set of commands written in a specific order. However, the actual commands generated by the `map_obj_to_commands` function are not in the expected order, leading to the test failure.

The potential error location is the `add` function within the `map_obj_to_commands` function. The `add` function appends commands to the `commands` list but does not consider the order in which commands should be added.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `add` function simply appends the command to the end of the list without considering any specific order. This can result in the commands being out of order compared to what is expected.

To fix the bug, the `add` function should consider the specific order in which commands need to be added. A possible approach is to define a specific order for the commands and ensure that the `add` function inserts commands at the correct index based on this order.

Here's the corrected code for the `map_obj_to_commands` function:

```python
def map_obj_to_commands(updates, module, warnings):
    commands = list()
    want, have = updates

    def needs_update(x):
        return want.get(x) is not None and (want.get(x) != have.get(x))

    def add(cmd):
        if 'management api http-commands' not in commands:
            commands.insert(0, 'management api http-commands')
        if cmd.startswith('no') or cmd.startswith('vrf'):
            commands.append(cmd)  # Append 'no' and 'vrf' commands to the end
        else:
            insert_index = 1 if 'management api http-commands' in commands else 0
            commands.insert(insert_index, cmd)  # Insert other commands at the desired index

    # ... rest of the function remains unchanged ...

    return commands
```

In the corrected code, the `add` function first checks whether the command starts with 'no' or 'vrf'. If it does, it appends the command to the end of the list. Otherwise, it calculates the index at which the command should be added and inserts it at the desired position in the `commands` list. This ensures that the commands are added in the expected order.
