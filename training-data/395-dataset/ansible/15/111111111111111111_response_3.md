The error seems to be occurring at the `add` function within the `map_obj_to_commands` function. The `add` function is supposed to check if a particular command is already present in the `commands` list before inserting it, but it currently does not do so.

The bug occurs because the `add` function does not correctly check if the command is already in the `commands` list before adding it. This results in duplicate entries for commands like 'no shutdown' and 'vrf test'.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `add` function to check if a command is already in the `commands` list before adding it.

Here's the corrected code for the `map_obj_to_commands` function:

```python
def map_obj_to_commands(updates, module, warnings):
    commands = list()
    want, have = updates

    def needs_update(x):
        return want.get(x) is not None and (want.get(x) != have.get(x))

    def add(cmd):
        if cmd not in commands:
            if 'management api http-commands' not in commands:
                commands.insert(0, 'management api http-commands')
            commands.append(cmd)

    # rest of the code...

    return commands
```

With this correction, the `add` function will first check if the command is already in the `commands` list before adding it, preventing duplicate entries and resolving the issue with the test case.
