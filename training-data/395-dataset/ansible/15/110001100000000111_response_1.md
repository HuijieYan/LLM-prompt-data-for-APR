The bug appears to be in the `map_obj_to_commands` function. It seems that the `add` function is not adding the correct commands to the `commands` list. 

The issue with the code is that the `add` function checks if the command 'management api http-commands' is in the `commands` list before inserting it, but it doesn't do this correctly. Also, the function is supposed to check for missing commands before adding them.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the logic inside the `add` function to correctly check if the command has been added or not. Additionally, it should check if the specific HTTP/HTTPS/Local HTTP server commands are present in the `commands` list before adding the new command.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
# relative function's signature in the file
def map_obj_to_commands(updates, module, warnings):
    commands = list()
    want, have = updates

    def needs_update(x):
        return want.get(x) is not None and (want.get(x) != have.get(x))

    def add(cmd):
        if cmd not in commands:
            commands.append(cmd)

    if any((needs_update('http'), needs_update('http_port'))):
        if want['http'] is False:
            add('no protocol http')
        else:
            if have['http'] is False and want['http'] in (False, None):
                warnings.append('protocol http is not enabled, not configuring http port value')
            else:
                port = want['http_port'] or 80
                add('protocol http port %s' % port)

    if any((needs_update('https'), needs_update('https_port'))):
        if want['https'] is False:
            add('no protocol https')
        else:
            if have['https'] is False and want['https'] in (False, None):
                warnings.append('protocol https is not enabled, not configuring https port value')
            else:
                port = want['https_port'] or 443
                add('protocol https port %s' % port)

    if any((needs_update('local_http'), needs_update('local_http_port'))):
        if want['local_http'] is False:
            add('no protocol http localhost')
        else:
            if have['local_http'] is False and want['local_http'] in (False, None):
                warnings.append('protocol local_http is not enabled, not configuring local_http port value')
            else:
                port = want['local_http_port'] or 8080
                add('protocol http localhost port %s' % port)

    if any((needs_update('socket'), needs_update('socket'))):
        if want['socket'] is False:
            add('no protocol unix-socket')
        else:
            add('protocol unix-socket')

    if needs_update('state') and not needs_update('vrf'):
        if want['state'] == 'stopped':
            add('shutdown')
        elif want['state'] == 'started':
            add('no shutdown')

    if needs_update('vrf'):
        add('vrf %s' % want['vrf'])
        # switching operational vrfs here
        # need to add the desired state as well
        if want['state'] == 'stopped':
            add('shutdown')
        elif want['state'] == 'started':
            add('no shutdown')

    if 'management api http-commands' not in commands:
        commands.insert(0, 'management api http-commands')

    return commands
```
