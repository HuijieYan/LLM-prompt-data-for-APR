The bug in the provided function `map_obj_to_commands` is causing the `test_eos_eapi_vrf` test case to fail. Based on the error message, it seems like the commands generated by the `map_obj_to_commands` function are not matching the expected commands.

The issue likely arises from the `add` function within `map_obj_to_commands`. It inserts 'management api http-commands' at index 0 of the `commands` list, but afterwards, it appends commands to `commands`. This could lead to duplication or a different order of commands. Additionally, when adding elements to the `commands` list, it should handle the case when the list is empty.

To fix the bug, the `add` function should be modified to handle these cases. By incorporating a check to see if the command is already present and then adding the command to the list, the expected commands can be achieved.

Here is the fixed `map_obj_to_commands` function:

```python
def map_obj_to_commands(updates, module, warnings):
    commands = list()
    want, have = updates

    def needs_update(x):
        return want.get(x) is not None and (want.get(x) != have.get(x))

    def add(cmd):
        if cmd not in commands:
            if not commands:
                commands.append('management api http-commands')
            commands.append(cmd)

    # rest of the function remains unchanged...
```

With these modifications, the function should now handle the addition of commands correctly, avoiding duplication and ensuring that the 'management api http-commands' is inserted at the beginning if it does not already exist.
