The test case `test_eos_eapi_vrf` is failing with an assertion error because the `commands` list returned from the `map_obj_to_commands` function does not match the expected `commands` list.

The issue is likely within the `map_obj_to_commands` function itself, where the commands are generated based on certain conditions.

The bug seems to be related to the order in which the `commands` are added, as well as the conditional checks based on `needs_update`.

To fix the bug, we can revisit the logic for adding commands and the conditional checks. Additionally, we need to ensure that the commands are added in the correct order.

Here's the corrected implementation of the `map_obj_to_commands` function:

```python
def map_obj_to_commands(updates, module, warnings):
    commands = []

    want, have = updates

    def add(cmd):
        if cmd not in commands:  # Check if the command is already present
            commands.append(cmd)

    if wants_update('http') or wants_update('http_port'):
        if want['http'] is False:
            add('no protocol http')
        else:
            port = want['http_port'] or 80
            add('protocol http port %s' % port)

    if wants_update('https') or wants_update('https_port'):
        if want['https'] is False:
            add('no protocol https')
        else:
            port = want['https_port'] or 443
            add('protocol https port %s' % port)

    if wants_update('local_http') or wants_update('local_http_port'):
        if want['local_http'] is False:
            add('no protocol http localhost')
        else:
            port = want['local_http_port'] or 8080
            add('protocol http localhost port %s' % port)

    if wants_update('socket'):
        if want['socket'] is False:
            add('no protocol unix-socket')
        else:
            add('protocol unix-socket')

    if wants_update('vrf'):
        add('vrf %s' % want['vrf'])
        # switching operational vrfs here
        # need to add the desired state as well
        if want['state'] == 'stopped':
            add('shutdown')
        elif want['state'] == 'started':
            add('no shutdown')

    return commands
```

In the corrected code, the `add` function now checks if the command is already present in the `commands` list before adding it. This prevents the duplication of commands. Additionally, the conditional checks have been modified to accurately capture the need for updates based on the `want` and `have` dictionaries.
