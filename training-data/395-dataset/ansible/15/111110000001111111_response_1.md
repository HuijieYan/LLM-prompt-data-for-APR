The bug seems to be occurring because the function is not adding the necessary `management api http-commands` when it should be added.

The issue arises from the `add` function, which is supposed to add commands to the list, but it does not check for the presence of commands before inserting the 'management api http-commands' element. This check should be implemented to ensure that the element is not added multiple times.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `add` function to first check whether 'management api http-commands' is present in the list of commands. If it is not present, then 'management api http-commands' should be inserted at the beginning of the list.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def map_obj_to_commands(updates, module, warnings):
    commands = list()
    want, have = updates

    def needs_update(x):
        return want.get(x) is not None and (want.get(x) != have.get(x))

    def add(cmd):
        if cmd not in commands:
            commands.insert(0, 'management api http-commands')
        commands.append(cmd)

    if any((needs_update('http'), needs_update('http_port'))):
        if want['http'] is False:
            add('no protocol http')
        else:
            if have['http'] is False and want['http'] in (False, None):
                warnings.append('protocol http is not enabled, not configuring http port value')
            else:
                port = want['http_port'] or 80
                add('protocol http port %s' % port)

    # rest of the code remains unchanged

    return commands
```

In this corrected code, the `add` function first checks whether the command is already present in the list. If not, it then adds 'management api http-commands' to the beginning of the list before appending the desired command. This ensures that 'management api http-commands' is added only once.
