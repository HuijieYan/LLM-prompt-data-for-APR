1. The error message states that the `eos_eapi` function is not turning on the Arista eAPI as expected, and it's missing an important command. This is resulting in the default behavior leaving the user with no enabled eAPI.

2. The potential error location within the `map_obj_to_commands` function is in the `add` function, where the condition for checking if 'management api http-commands' exists in the `commands` list is incorrect. 

3. The root cause of the bug is as described in the error message. The `map_obj_to_commands` function is not adding the necessary commands to enable the eAPI, specifically the 'management api http-commands' section with the appropriate configurations.

4. To fix the bug, the `add` function should properly check for the existence of 'management api http-commands' in the `commands` list and add it if not already present. Additionally, the function should add the necessary subcommands for enabling the eAPI.

5. Corrected code for the `map_obj_to_commands` function:

```python
def map_obj_to_commands(updates, module, warnings):
    commands = []
    want, have = updates

    def needs_update(x):
        return want.get(x) is not None and (want.get(x) != have.get(x))

    def add(cmd):
        if 'management api http-commands' not in commands:
            commands.append('management api http-commands')

        commands.append(cmd)

    if any((needs_update('http'), needs_update('http_port'))):
        if want['http'] is False:
            add('no protocol http')
        else:
            if have['http'] is False and want['http'] in (False, None):
                warnings.append('protocol http is not enabled, not configuring http port value')
            else:
                port = want.get('http_port') or 80
                add('protocol http port %s' % port)

    if any((needs_update('https'), needs_update('https_port'))):
        if want['https'] is False:
            add('no protocol https')
        else:
            if have['https'] is False and want['https'] in (False, None):
                warnings.append('protocol https is not enabled, not configuring https port value')
            else:
                port = want.get('https_port') or 443
                add('protocol https port %s' % port)

    # The rest of the code remains the same
```

The corrected `add` function now properly checks if 'management api http-commands' is not in the `commands` list and appends it if not, followed by adding the specified eAPI configuration commands.
