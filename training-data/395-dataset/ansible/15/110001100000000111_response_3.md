The issue reported is that the eos_eapi module does not turn on the Arista eAPI by default. The specific problem is related to the missing command 'management api http-commands' that should be rendered when the eos_eapi module is used.

Based on the error message, it seems that the 'management api http-commands' is not being properly configured, leading to the 'Enabled: No' result instead of 'Enabled: Yes' as expected.

The potential error in the code is likely within the `map_obj_to_commands` function where the `commands` list is populated with the necessary configuration commands. It seems that the conditional checks for needs_update for various properties might not be working as intended.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the 'management api http-commands' is added to the `commands` list if it's not already present. Additionally, the conditions for enabling/disabling 'http', 'https', 'local_http' and 'socket' need to be properly checked and corresponding commands should be added to the `commands` list.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def map_obj_to_commands(updates, module, warnings):
    commands = list()
    want, have = updates

    if 'management api http-commands' not in commands:
        commands.append('management api http-commands')

    if want.get('http') is False:
        commands.append('no protocol http')
    elif want.get('http') and have.get('http') is False and want.get('http') in (False, None):
        warnings.append('protocol http is not enabled, not configuring http port value')
    else:
        port = want.get('http_port') or 80
        commands.append(f'protocol http port {port}')

    if want.get('https') is False:
        commands.append('no protocol https')
    elif want.get('https') and have.get('https') is False and want.get('https') in (False, None):
        warnings.append('protocol https is not enabled, not configuring https port value')
    else:
        port = want.get('https_port') or 443
        commands.append(f'protocol https port {port}')

    if want.get('local_http') is False:
        commands.append('no protocol http localhost')
    elif want.get('local_http') and have.get('local_http') is False and want.get('local_http') in (False, None):
        warnings.append('protocol local_http is not enabled, not configuring local_http port value')
    else:
        port = want.get('local_http_port') or 8080
        commands.append(f'protocol http localhost port {port}')

    if want.get('socket') is False:
        commands.append('no protocol unix-socket')
    else:
        commands.append('protocol unix-socket')

    if needs_update('state') and not needs_update('vrf'):
        if want['state'] == 'stopped':
            commands.append('shutdown')
        elif want['state'] == 'started':
            commands.append('no shutdown')

    if needs_update('vrf'):
        commands.append(f'vrf {want["vrf"]}')
        if want['state'] == 'stopped':
            commands.append('shutdown')
        elif want['state'] == 'started':
            commands.append('no shutdown')

    return commands
```

In this corrected code:
- The 'management api http-commands' is added to the `commands` list if it's not already present.
- Specific conditions for enabling/disabling 'http', 'https', 'local_http' and 'socket' have been added followed by the corresponding commands being added to the `commands` list.
