The bug in the function `map_obj_to_commands` seems to be related to the handling of the `http` and `https` protocols. The function is not correctly checking whether these protocols need to be updated and is not adding the appropriate commands to the `commands` list.

It seems like the function is not properly identifying when the `http` and `https` protocols are disabled and needs to be turned on, and vice versa.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `needs_update` function to correctly identify when the protocols need to be updated. Additionally, the `add` function needs to be modified to add the correct commands to enable or disable the protocols.

Here's the corrected function:
```python
def map_obj_to_commands(updates, module, warnings):
    commands = list()
    want, have = updates

    def needs_update(x):
        return want.get(x) is not None and want.get(x) != have.get(x)

    def add(cmd):
        if 'management api http-commands' not in commands:
            commands.insert(0, 'management api http-commands')
        commands.append(cmd)

    if any((needs_update('http'), needs_update('http_port'))):
        if want['http'] is False:
            add('no protocol http')
        else:
            if have['http'] is False and want['http'] in (False, None):
                warnings.append('protocol http is not enabled, not configuring http port value')
            else:
                port = want['http_port'] or 80
                add('protocol http port %s' % port)

    if any((needs_update('https'), needs_update('https_port'))):
        if want['https'] is False:
            add('no protocol https')
        else:
            if have['https'] is False and want['https'] in (False, None):
                warnings.append('protocol https is not enabled, not configuring https port value')
            else:
                port = want['https_port'] or 443
                add('protocol https port %s' % port)

    # Rest of the code remains the same

    return commands
```

With these changes, the function should correctly handle the update of the `http` and `https` protocols.
