The issue appears to be related to the eos_eapi module not turning on the Arista eAPI by default when attempting to configure it using ansible. The commands generated by the map_obj_to_commands function in eos_eapi.py are not setting the eAPI configuration as expected. The code is not correctly handling the vrf default setting and is missing a command to enable the HTTP API server.

The potential error location within the map_obj_to_commands function is in the block where the vrf setting is checked. It is not properly handling the default vrf and missing the command to enable the HTTP API server.

The bug occurs because the code is not adding the correct commands to enable the HTTP API server, and it is not handling the default vrf correctly. This results in the HTTP API server not being enabled, and the vrf default setting not being properly configured.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct commands are added to enable the HTTP API server and handle the vrf default setting properly.

Below is the corrected code for the map_obj_to_commands function:

```python
def map_obj_to_commands(updates, module, warnings):
    commands = list()
    want, have = updates

    def needs_update(x):
        return want.get(x) is not None and (want.get(x) != have.get(x))

    def add(cmd):
        if cmd not in commands:  # Check if command already exists
            commands.append(cmd)

    if any((needs_update('http'), needs_update('http_port'))):
        if want['http'] is False:
            add('no protocol http')
        else:
            port = want['http_port'] or 80
            add('management api http-commands\n   no shutdown\n   !')
            add('protocol http port %s' % port)

    if any((needs_update('https'), needs_update('https_port'))):
        if want['https'] is False:
            add('no protocol https')
        else:
            port = want['https_port'] or 443
            add('protocol https port %s' % port)

    if any((needs_update('local_http'), needs_update('local_http_port'))):
        if want['local_http'] is False:
            add('no protocol http localhost')
        else:
            port = want['local_http_port'] or 8080
            add('protocol http localhost port %s' % port)

    if needs_update('socket') and want['socket'] is False:
        add('no protocol unix-socket')

    if needs_update('state') and not needs_update('vrf'):
        if want['state'] == 'stopped':
            add('shutdown')
        elif want['state'] == 'started':
            add('no shutdown')

    if needs_update('vrf'):
        if want['vrf'] == 'default':
            add('management api http-commands\n   no shutdown\n   !')  # If vrf is default, enable HTTP API server
        add('vrf %s' % want['vrf'])
        if want['state'] == 'stopped':
            add('shutdown')
        elif want['state'] == 'started':
            add('no shutdown')

    return commands
```

In the corrected code, we have added a block to enable the HTTP API server when the vrf is set to 'default'. This ensures that the HTTP API server is enabled by default as per the expectations of the user. Additionally, we have replaced 'if' conditions with 'if-else' conditions for more accurate command generation. Finally, we have also added a check to ensure that duplicate commands are not added to the commands list.
