The test case is checking for the commands generated by the `map_obj_to_commands` function and comparing them against an expected list of commands. The error message indicates that the `vrf` command is not in the correct position in the list of commands.

The potential error location within the `map_obj_to_commands` function is likely in the section that handles the `vrf` command. It seems that when the `vrf` command is added, it is not in the correct position relative to the other commands.

The bug occurs because the `vrf` command is being added at the end of the list of commands. However, based on the test case, it should be added after 'management api http-commands' and before 'no shutdown'.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `vrf` command is inserted at the correct position in the `commands` list.

Here's the corrected code for the `map_obj_to_commands` function:

```python
def map_obj_to_commands(updates, module, warnings):
    commands = list()
    want, have = updates

    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    if needs_update('vrf'):
        vrf_cmd = 'vrf %s' % want['vrf']
        if 'management api http-commands' in commands:
            index = commands.index('management api http-commands')
            commands.insert(index + 1, vrf_cmd)
        else:
            commands.append('management api http-commands')
            commands.append(vrf_cmd)

        # switching operational vrfs here
        # need to add the desired state as well
        if want['state'] == 'stopped':
            add('shutdown')
        elif want['state'] == 'started':
            add('no shutdown')

    return commands
```

In the corrected code, when the `vrf` command needs to be added, we first check if 'management api http-commands' is already in the list of commands. If it is, we find its index and insert the `vrf` command at the next position. If 'management api http-commands' is not present, we add it to the list along with the `vrf` command. This ensures that the `vrf` command is in the correct position relative to the other commands.
