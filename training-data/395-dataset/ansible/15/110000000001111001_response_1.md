The bug occurs in the `add` function. The `if 'management api http-commands' not in commands` condition is checking whether a string is in the list `commands`, but it should be checking if a substring exists in any of the command strings in the list `commands`. As a result, the 'management api http-commands' is always being inserted at the 0th index of the `commands` list, regardless of whether it already exists or not.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the substring 'management api http-commands' exists in any of the command strings in the `commands` list. If it does not exist, then we insert it at the 0th index. We should also replace `commands.insert(0, 'management api http-commands')` with `commands.append('management api http-commands')` to maintain the order of commands in the list.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def map_obj_to_commands(updates, module, warnings):
    commands = list()
    want, have = updates

    def needs_update(x):
        return want.get(x) is not None and (want.get(x) != have.get(x))

    def add(cmd):
        if not any('management api http-commands' in c for c in commands):
            commands.insert(0, cmd)
        else:
            commands.append(cmd)

    # rest of the code remains unchanged

    return commands
```
