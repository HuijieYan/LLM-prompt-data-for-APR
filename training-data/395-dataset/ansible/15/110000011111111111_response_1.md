The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect ordering of commands added to the `commands` list within the `add` function. 

The function `add` inserts the 'management api http-commands' at position 0 if it is not already present in the list. However, after inserting 'management api http-commands' at position 0, it continues to append the subsequent commands, leading to the incorrect ordering of commands in the `commands` list.

To fix this, the `add` function needs to stop executing after inserting 'management api http-commands' at position 0.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def map_obj_to_commands(updates, module, warnings):
    commands = list()
    want, have = updates

    def needs_update(x):
        return want.get(x) is not None and (want.get(x) != have.get(x))

    def add(cmd):
        if 'management api http-commands' not in commands:
            commands.insert(0, 'management api http-commands')
        else:
            # Once 'management api http-commands' is inserted, stop appending commands
            return commands.append(cmd)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    
    # ... rest of the code ...

    return commands
```

With this corrected implementation of the `add` function, the commands appended after 'management api http-commands' will maintain their correct order in the `commands` list.
