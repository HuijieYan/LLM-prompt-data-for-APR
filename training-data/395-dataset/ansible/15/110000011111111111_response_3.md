The test case seems to be related to the `eos_eapi` function, which is not correctly setting up the eAPI configurations. The error message indicates that the commands generated by the `map_obj_to_commands` function are not matching the expected commands. This suggests that the commands are not being constructed properly, leading to a misconfiguration.

The potential error location within the `map_obj_to_commands` function could be in the `add` function, where the commands are appended. It seems that the logic within this function might not be correctly handling different scenarios for setting up the eAPI configurations.

The bug seems to be occurring because the `add` function is not properly checking and appending commands for eAPI configurations based on the provided `updates` and existing configurations (`have`).

To fix the bug, the logic within the `add` function needs to be modified to correctly handle different scenarios for setting up eAPI configurations. Additionally, the conditions for updating eAPI configurations (`needs_update` function) should be carefully checked to ensure that the correct conditions are being evaluated.

Here's the corrected code for the `map_obj_to_commands` function:

```python
def map_obj_to_commands(updates, module, warnings):
    commands = []

    want, have = updates

    def needs_update(x):
        return want.get(x) is not None and want.get(x) != have.get(x)

    def add(cmd):
        nonlocal commands
        if 'management api http-commands' not in commands:
            commands.insert(0, 'management api http-commands')
        commands.append(cmd)

    if any((needs_update('http'), needs_update('http_port'))):
        if want['http'] is False:
            add('no protocol http')
        else:
            if have['http'] is False and want['http'] in (False, None):
                warnings.append('protocol http is not enabled, not configuring http port value')
            else:
                port = want['http_port'] or 80
                add('protocol http port %s' % port)

    if any((needs_update('https'), needs_update('https_port'))):
        if want['https'] is False:
            add('no protocol https')
        else:
            if have['https'] is False and want['https'] in (False, None):
                warnings.append('protocol https is not enabled, not configuring https port value')
            else:
                port = want['https_port'] or 443
                add('protocol https port %s' % port)

    if any((needs_update('local_http'), needs_update('local_http_port'))):
        if want['local_http'] is False:
            add('no protocol http localhost')
        else:
            if have['local_http'] is False and want['local_http'] in (False, None):
                warnings.append('protocol local_http is not enabled, not configuring local_http port value')
            else:
                port = want['local_http_port'] or 8080
                add('protocol http localhost port %s' % port)

    if any((needs_update('socket'), needs_update('socket'))):
        if want['socket'] is False:
            add('no protocol unix-socket')
        else:
            add('protocol unix-socket')

    if needs_update('state') and not needs_update('vrf'):
        if want['state'] == 'stopped':
            add('shutdown')
        elif want['state'] == 'started':
            add('no shutdown')

    if needs_update('vrf'):
        add('vrf %s' % want['vrf'])
        # switching operational vrfs here
        # need to add the desired state as well
        if want['state'] == 'stopped':
            add('shutdown')
        elif want['state'] == 'started':
            add('no shutdown')

    return commands
