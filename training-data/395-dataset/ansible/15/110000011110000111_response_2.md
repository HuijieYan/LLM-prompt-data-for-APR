The issue seems to be related to the incorrect order of commands in the `map_obj_to_commands` function. The error message from the test function indicates that the commands are not in the expected order.

The potential error location is within the `add` function, where the commands are being appended to the `commands` list without checking the existence of the command "management api http-commands" in the list.

The bug is occurring because the code does not explicitly check if the command "management api http-commands" already exists in the list before inserting it. This leads to duplicate entries and incorrect ordering of commands.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if "management api http-commands" exists in the list. If it does, we should not insert it again. Additionally, if the command already exists, we need to skip adding it again at the end of the list.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def map_obj_to_commands(updates, module, warnings):
    commands = list()
    want, have = updates

    def needs_update(x):
        return want.get(x) is not None and (want.get(x) != have.get(x))

    def add(cmd):
        if cmd not in commands:
            commands.append(cmd)

    if any((needs_update('http'), needs_update('http_port'))):
        if want['http'] is False:
            add('no protocol http')
        else:
            if have['http'] is False and want['http'] in (False, None):
                warnings.append('protocol http is not enabled, not configuring http port value')
            else:
                port = want['http_port'] or 80
                add('protocol http port %s' % port)

    if any((needs_update('https'), needs_update('https_port'))):
        if want['https'] is False:
            add('no protocol https')
        else:
            if have['https'] is False and want['https'] in (False, None):
                warnings.append('protocol https is not enabled, not configuring https port value')
            else:
                port = want['https_port'] or 443
                add('protocol https port %s' % port)

    if any((needs_update('local_http'), needs_update('local_http_port'))):
        if want['local_http'] is False:
            add('no protocol http localhost')
        else:
            if have['local_http'] is False and want['local_http'] in (False, None):
                warnings.append('protocol local_http is not enabled, not configuring local_http port value')
            else:
                port = want['local_http_port'] or 8080
                add('protocol http localhost port %s' % port)

    if any((needs_update('socket'), needs_update('socket'))):
        if want['socket'] is False:
            add('no protocol unix-socket')
        else:
            add('protocol unix-socket')

    if needs_update('state') and not needs_update('vrf'):
        if want['state'] == 'stopped':
            add('shutdown')
        elif want['state'] == 'started':
            add('no shutdown')

    if needs_update('vrf'):
        add('vrf %s' % want['vrf'])
        # switching operational vrfs here
        # need to add the desired state as well
        if want['state'] == 'stopped':
            add('shutdown')
        elif want['state'] == 'started':
            add('no shutdown')

    if 'management api http-commands' not in commands:
        commands.insert(0, 'management api http-commands')

    return commands
```

In the corrected function, we have added a check in the `add` function to ensure that the command is only appended to the `commands` list if it does not already exist. Additionally, we have moved the check for the existence of "management api http-commands" to the end of the function to ensure it is at the beginning of the list. This should fix the issue identified in the error message.
