The issue seems to be with the `add` function inside the `map_obj_to_commands` function. The function is supposed to add items to the `commands` list but it is not working as intended. Also, the logic inside the `needs_update` function might not be correctly identifying the updates.

The main issue is with the `add` function. It currently checks whether 'management api http-commands' is in the list of commands before inserting it, but it should check whether it is not already present in the list.

Additionally, the `needs_update` function might not be correctly identifying the updates. It should return `True` if an update is needed but the current implementation might not be returning the expected results.

To fix the issue, we need to update the `add` function to check for the absence of 'management api http-commands' in the list of commands before inserting it. Additionally, we need to review and correct the logic in the `needs_update` function to ensure it accurately identifies the updates.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def map_obj_to_commands(updates, module, warnings):
    commands = list()
    want, have = updates

    def needs_update(x):
        return want.get(x) != have.get(x)

    def add(cmd):
        if cmd not in commands:
            commands.append(cmd)

    if any((needs_update('http'), needs_update('http_port'))):
        if want['http'] is False:
            add('no protocol http')
        else:
            if have['http'] is False and want['http'] in (False, None):
                warnings.append('protocol http is not enabled, not configuring http port value')
            else:
                port = want['http_port'] or 80
                add('protocol http port %s' % port)

    if any((needs_update('https'), needs_update('https_port'))):
        if want['https'] is False:
            add('no protocol https')
        else:
            if have['https'] is False and want['https'] in (False, None):
                warnings.append('protocol https is not enabled, not configuring https port value')
            else:
                port = want['https_port'] or 443
                add('protocol https port %s' % port)

    if any((needs_update('local_http'), needs_update('local_http_port'))):
        if want['local_http'] is False:
            add('no protocol http localhost')
        else:
            if have['local_http'] is False and want['local_http'] in (False, None):
                warnings.append('protocol local_http is not enabled, not configuring local_http port value')
            else:
                port = want['local_http_port'] or 8080
                add('protocol http localhost port %s' % port)

    if any((needs_update('socket'), needs_update('socket'))):
        if want['socket'] is False:
            add('no protocol unix-socket')
        else:
            add('protocol unix-socket')

    if needs_update('state') and not needs_update('vrf'):
        if want['state'] == 'stopped':
            add('shutdown')
        elif want['state'] == 'started':
            add('no shutdown')

    if needs_update('vrf'):
        add('vrf %s' % want['vrf'])
        # switching operational vrfs here
        # need to add the desired state as well
        if want['state'] == 'stopped':
            add('shutdown')
        elif want['state'] == 'started':
            add('no shutdown')

    if 'management api http-commands' not in commands:
        commands.insert(0, 'management api http-commands')

    return commands
```

This corrected function should address the issues and provide the expected outputs for the given test case.
