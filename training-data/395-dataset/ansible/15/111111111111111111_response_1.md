The bug seems to be related to the incorrect generation of commands for the "eos_eapi" function, resulting in the API not being turned on by default. The test case is trying to set the VRF to "test," but the generated commands do not reflect this change.

The potential error location is in the "map_obj_to_commands" function, specifically in the "add" function where the VRF is being incorrectly handled.

The bug occurs because the "add" function does not add the VRF command properly when "vrf" and "state" need to be updated.

To fix the bug, the "add" function should be modified to handle the "vrf" and "state" updates properly and ensure that the VRF is added before the state is configured.

Here's the corrected code for the "map_obj_to_commands" function:

```python
def map_obj_to_commands(updates, module, warnings):
    commands = list()
    want, have = updates

    def needs_update(x):
        return want.get(x) is not None and (want.get(x) != have.get(x))

    def add(cmd):
        if 'management api http-commands' not in commands:
            commands.insert(0, 'management api http-commands')
        commands.append(cmd)

    if any((needs_update('http'), needs_update('http_port'))):
        if want['http'] is False:
            add('no protocol http')
        else:
            port = want['http_port'] or 80
            add('protocol http port %s' % port)

    if any((needs_update('https'), needs_update('https_port'))):
        if want['https'] is False:
            add('no protocol https')
        else:
            port = want['https_port'] or 443
            add('protocol https port %s' % port)

    if any((needs_update('local_http'), needs_update('local_http_port'))):
        if want['local_http'] is False:
            add('no protocol http localhost')
        else:
            port = want['local_http_port'] or 8080
            add('protocol http localhost port %s' % port)

    if any((needs_update('socket'), needs_update('socket'))):
        if want['socket'] is False:
            add('no protocol unix-socket')
        else:
            add('protocol unix-socket')

    if needs_update('vrf'):
        add('vrf %s' % want['vrf'])
        if needs_update('state'):
            if want['state'] == 'stopped':
                add('shutdown')
            elif want['state'] == 'started':
                add('no shutdown')
    else:
        if needs_update('state'):
            if want['state'] == 'stopped':
                add('shutdown')
            elif want['state'] == 'started':
                add('no shutdown')

    return commands
```

This corrected code ensures that the VRF is added before the state configuration, fixing the bug related to the incorrect generation of commands for the "eos_eapi" function.
