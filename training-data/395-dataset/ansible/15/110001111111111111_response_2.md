The issue arises in the `map_obj_to_commands` function, where certain commands are not being added to the `commands` list based on specific conditions. This is causing the `commands` list to be different from what is expected in the test.

The potential error location is within the `map_obj_to_commands` function where the `add` function is used to add commands to the `commands` list.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the conditions for adding commands to the `commands` list are not properly handled. As a result, certain commands are not being added when they should be.

To fix the bug, the conditions for adding commands to the `commands` list need to be reviewed and adjusted accordingly. Additionally, the logic for adding the commands based on the conditions should be improved.

Here is the corrected code for the `map_obj_to_commands` function:

```python
def map_obj_to_commands(updates, module, warnings):
    commands = list()
    want, have = updates

    def add(cmd):
        if cmd not in commands:
            commands.append(cmd)

    if want['http'] != have['http'] or want['http_port'] != have['http_port']:
        if want['http'] is False:
            add('no protocol http')
        else:
            port = want['http_port'] or 80
            add('protocol http port %s' % port)

    if want['https'] != have['https'] or want['https_port'] != have['https_port']:
        if want['https'] is False:
            add('no protocol https')
        else:
            port = want['https_port'] or 443
            add('protocol https port %s' % port)

    if want['local_http'] != have['local_http'] or want['local_http_port'] != have['local_http_port']:
        if want['local_http'] is False:
            add('no protocol http localhost')
        else:
            port = want['local_http_port'] or 8080
            add('protocol http localhost port %s' % port)

    if want['socket'] != have['socket']:
        if want['socket'] is False:
            add('no protocol unix-socket')
        else:
            add('protocol unix-socket')

    if want['state'] != have['state'] and want['state'] == 'stopped':
        add('shutdown')
    elif want['state'] != have['state'] and want['state'] == 'started':
        add('no shutdown')

    if want['vrf'] != have['vrf']:
        add('vrf %s' % want['vrf'])
        if want['state'] == 'stopped':
            add('shutdown')
        elif want['state'] == 'started':
            add('no shutdown')

    return commands
```

This corrected code addresses the conditions for adding commands to the `commands` list and ensures that the appropriate commands are added based on the comparison between `want` and `have`.
