Potential error location: 
The `add` function is not behaving as expected because it only checks for the presence of 'management api http-commands' once, and then it appends the new commands without checking for its presence again.

Reason behind the bug:
The `add` function checks for the presence of 'management api http-commands' in the `commands` list only once and then appends the new commands. This may result in multiple 'management api http-commands' entries in the `commands` list.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check for the presence of 'management api http-commands' before appending it to the `commands` list to avoid duplication.
2. Use a flag to indicate whether 'management api http-commands' has already been added and then append it only if the flag is not set.

Corrected code:
```python
def map_obj_to_commands(updates, module, warnings):
    commands = list()
    want, have = updates
    management_api_added = False

    def needs_update(x):
        return want.get(x) is not None and (want.get(x) != have.get(x))

    def add(cmd):
        if 'management api http-commands' not in commands and not management_api_added:
            commands.insert(0, 'management api http-commands')
            management_api_added = True
        commands.append(cmd)

    # remaining code stays the same

    return commands
```
