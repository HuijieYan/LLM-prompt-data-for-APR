The bug occurs within the `map_obj_to_commands` function in the `add` function. The function is intended to add the command 'management api http-commands' if it is not already in the list of commands. However, the current implementation does not check the presence of this command correctly, causing it to be added multiple times.

The reason for this bug is that the condition for checking if 'management api http-commands' is in the list is incorrect. Instead of checking if the command is in the list, it checks if the string 'management api http-commands' is in the entire list, which would always return False. As a result, 'management api http-commands' is added each time the `add` function is called.

To fix this bug, the condition in the `add` function should be updated to check if 'management api http-commands' is not in the commands list before inserting it.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def map_obj_to_commands(updates, module, warnings):
    commands = list()
    want, have = updates

    def needs_update(x):
        return want.get(x) is not None and (want.get(x) != have.get(x))

    def add(cmd):
        if 'management api http-commands' not in commands:
            commands.insert(0, 'management api http-commands')
        if cmd not in commands:
            commands.append(cmd)

    # ... (remaining unchanged code)

    return commands
```
