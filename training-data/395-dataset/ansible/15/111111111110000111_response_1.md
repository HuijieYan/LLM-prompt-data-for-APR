The error seems to be related to the `map_obj_to_commands` function not generating the correct list of commands, based on the provided test case and the error message.

The potential error location within the `map_obj_to_commands` function is the `add` function. It seems that the `add` function adds duplicate entries to the `commands` list and does not handle the case where the command is already present in the list.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `add` function does not check for duplicate commands before appending, which leads to multiple instances of the same command being added to the `commands` list.

To fix the bug, a check for duplicate commands needs to be added before appending a new command to the `commands` list. This can be achieved by checking if the command is already present in the list before adding it.

Here's the corrected code for the `map_obj_to_commands` function:

```python
def map_obj_to_commands(updates, module, warnings):
    commands = list()
    want, have = updates

    def needs_update(x):
        return want.get(x) is not None and (want.get(x) != have.get(x))

    def add(cmd):
        if cmd not in commands:  # Check for duplicate command
            if 'management api http-commands' not in commands:
                commands.insert(0, 'management api http-commands')
            commands.append(cmd)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this modification, the `add` function now checks if the command is already present in the `commands` list before adding it. This will prevent duplicate commands from being added, and the test case should pass without any assertion errors.
