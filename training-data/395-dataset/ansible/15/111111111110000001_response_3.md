The error message indicates that the `commands` list is not in the expected order, leading to an assertion error in the test case.

The potential error location within the `map_obj_to_commands` function is in the `vrf` section. It seems that the order of commands for vrf handling is incorrect.

The issue occurs because the `vrf` command and the "no shutdown" command are not in the correct order in the `commands` list. This is caused by the way the `map_obj_to_commands` function is adding commands to the list.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the 'vrf' command is added before the 'no shutdown' command, and in the correct order.

Here's the corrected code for the `map_obj_to_commands` function:

```python
def map_obj_to_commands(updates, module, warnings):
    commands = list()
    want, have = updates

    def needs_update(x):
        return want.get(x) is not None and (want.get(x) != have.get(x))

    def add(cmd):
        if 'management api http-commands' not in commands:
            commands.insert(0, 'management api http-commands')
        commands.append(cmd)

    # Rest of the code for processing updates

    if any((needs_update('vrf'))):
        if wants['vrf']:
            add('vrf %s' % want['vrf'])

        # checking if state is stopped or started
        if needs_update('state'):
            if want['state'] == 'stopped':
                add('shutdown')
            elif want['state'] == 'started':
                add('no shutdown')

    return commands
```

With these changes, the 'vrf' command is added first if needed, and then the 'shutdown' or 'no shutdown' command is added based on the state. This should resolve the ordering issue in the `commands` list.
