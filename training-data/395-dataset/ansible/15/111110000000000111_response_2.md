The issue seems to be related to the generation of the 'management api http-commands' configuration on an Arista EOS device. The problem is that the EOS eAPI is not being turned on by default, leading to incorrect configurations.

The potential error location within the provided function is in the `add` function, particularly in the check for 'management api http-commands'. The code is using `if 'management api http-commands' not in commands` to check if it exists, but this will not work as intended because 'management api http-commands' is actually appended as a sub-element of the list `commands`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is the incorrect check for 'management api http-commands' in the list `commands`, which results in the command being added multiple times.

To fix the bug, a new approach for checking the existence of 'management api http-commands' in the `commands` list needs to be implemented.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
def map_obj_to_commands(updates, module, warnings):
    commands = list()
    want, have = updates

    def needs_update(x):
        return want.get(x) is not None and (want.get(x) != have.get(x))

    def add(cmd):
        # Check if 'management api http-commands' already exists in commands
        if not any('management api http-commands' in c for c in commands):
            commands.insert(0, 'management api http-commands')
        commands.append(cmd)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...

    return commands
```
