Potential error location:
The potential error is in the add function, where 'management api http-commands' should be appended to the commands list, not just checked for inclusion.

Explanation:
The add function has a condition that only adds 'management api http-commands' to the commands list if it is not already present. However, instead of checking if 'management api http-commands' is in the list, it should specifically be added to the beginning of the list before appending the cmd.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
The add function should be modified to always add 'management api http-commands' to the beginning of the commands list.

Corrected code:

```python
def map_obj_to_commands(updates, module, warnings):
    commands = list()
    want, have = updates

    def needs_update(x):
        return want.get(x) is not None and (want.get(x) != have.get(x))

    def add(cmd):
        commands.insert(0, 'management api http-commands')  # Add this line to always add 'management api http-commands'
        commands.append(cmd)

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
```
