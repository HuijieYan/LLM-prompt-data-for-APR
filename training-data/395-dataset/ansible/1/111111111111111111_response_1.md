The error message indicates a TypeError when trying to iterate over the `apis` object in the `from_name` method of the `CollectionRequirement` class. This suggests that the `apis` object is not iterable, but the code is treating it as if it should be.

The potential error location is in the `from_name` method where the `apis` object is being iterated over.

The reason behind the bug is that the `apis` object is not iterable, but the code is written in a way that assumes it is.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `apis` object is iterable or modify the code to handle a non-iterable `apis` object.

The corrected code for the problematic `verify_collections` function is as follows:

```python
def verify_collections(collections, search_paths, apis, validate_certs, ignore_errors, allow_pre_release=False):
    with _display_progress():
        with _tempdir() as b_temp_path:
            for collection in collections:
                try:
                    local_collection = None
                    b_collection = to_bytes(collection[0], errors='surrogate_or_strict')
                    
                    # existing code...
                    
                    if local_collection is None:
                        raise AnsibleError(message='Collection %s is not installed in any of the collection paths.' % collection_name)
                    
                    # existing code...

                    # Fixed to handle non-iterable apis
                    if isinstance(apis, GalaxyAPI):
                        apis = [apis]

                    remote_collection = CollectionRequirement.from_name(collection_name, apis, collection_version, False, parent=None,
                                                                        allow_pre_release=allow_pre_release)

                    # existing code...
                    
                except AnsibleError as err:
                    if ignore_errors:
                        display.warning("Failed to verify collection %s but skipping due to --ignore-errors being set. "
                                        "Error: %s" % (collection[0], to_text(err)))
                    else:
                        raise
``` 

In this corrected code, we are checking if the `apis` object is an instance of `GalaxyAPI`. If it is, we convert it to a list with a single element, containing the original `apis` object. This ensures that the `apis` object is iterable in the subsequent loop.
