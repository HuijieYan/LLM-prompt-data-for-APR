The error message indicates that the issue is occurring in the `from_name` method inside the `CollectionRequirement` class. The error message specifically mentions that `'GalaxyAPI' object is not iterable`, which points to a potential issue with iterating over the `apis` object.

Upon further analysis, it appears that the `apis` parameter passed to the `from_name` method is expected to be an iterable (e.g., list, tuple) to be iterated over in the for loop, but it is being passed a single object of type `GalaxyAPI` instead. This is causing the TypeError when the for loop attempts to iterate over the non-iterable object.

To fix this bug, the `from_name` method needs to be modified to handle the case where a single `GalaxyAPI` object is passed as `apis`. It should be designed to handle both single objects and iterable collections of `GalaxyAPI` objects.

Here's the corrected code for the `verify_collections` function:

```python
def verify_collections(collections, search_paths, apis, validate_certs, ignore_errors, allow_pre_release=False):

    with _display_progress():
        with _tempdir() as b_temp_path:
            for collection in collections:
                try:
                    # existing code unchanged

                    # Download collection on a galaxy server for comparison
                    try:
                        if not isinstance(apis, (list, tuple)):
                            apis = [apis]  # Ensure apis is iterable
                        for api in apis:
                            remote_collection = CollectionRequirement.from_name(collection_name, api, collection_version, False, parent=None,
                                                                                allow_pre_release=allow_pre_release)
                            # rest of the code remains unchanged
                    except AnsibleError as e:
                        if e.message == 'Failed to find collection %s:%s' % (collection[0], collection[1]):
                            raise AnsibleError('Failed to find remote collection %s:%s on any of the galaxy servers' % (collection[0], collection[1]))
                        raise
                    # existing code remains unchanged

                except AnsibleError as err:
                    if ignore_errors:
                        display.warning("Failed to verify collection %s but skipping due to --ignore-errors being set. "
                                        "Error: %s" % (collection[0], to_text(err)))
                    else:
                        raise
```

In this corrected code, the `from_name` method now explicitly checks if `apis` is not an iterable and converts it into a list to ensure that it can be iterated over in the subsequent for loop. This will fix the TypeError mentioned in the error message.
