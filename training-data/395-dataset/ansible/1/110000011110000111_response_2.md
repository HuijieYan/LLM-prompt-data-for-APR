The error message is indicating a TypeError at line 442 in the `collection.from_name` function. This function is being called in the `verify_collections` function on line 679. The error occurs when trying to iterate through the `apis` argument, which is of type `GalaxyAPI` and not iterable.

The reason for this bug is that the `apis` argument is expected to be iterable, but it's passed as an object of type `GalaxyAPI` which is not iterable.

To fix this bug, the `apis` argument should be passed as an iterable object, such as a list, containing the `GalaxyAPI` object.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def verify_collections(collections, search_paths, apis, validate_certs, ignore_errors, allow_pre_release=False):
    with _display_progress():
        with _tempdir() as b_temp_path:
            for collection in collections:
                try:
                    local_collection = None
                    b_collection = to_bytes(collection[0], errors='surrogate_or_strict')

                    if os.path.isfile(b_collection) or urlparse(collection[0]).scheme.lower() in ['http', 'https'] or len(collection[0].split('.')) != 2:
                        raise AnsibleError(message="'%s' is not a valid collection name. The format namespace.name is expected." % collection[0])

                    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

                    # Download collection on a galaxy server for comparison
                    try:
                        api_list = [apis]  # Convert to list
                        remote_collection = CollectionRequirement.from_name(collection_name, api_list, collection_version, False, parent=None, allow_pre_release=allow_pre_release)
                    except AnsibleError as e:
                        if e.message == 'Failed to find collection %s:%s' % (collection[0], collection[1]):
                            raise AnsibleError('Failed to find remote collection %s:%s on any of the galaxy servers' % (collection[0], collection[1]))
                        raise

                    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

                except AnsibleError as err:
                    if ignore_errors:
                        display.warning("Failed to verify collection %s but skipping due to --ignore-errors being set. "
                                        "Error: %s" % (collection[0], to_text(err)))
                    else:
                        raise
```
