Potential Error Location: 
The error seems to be occurring in the `from_name` function of the `CollectionRequirement` class in the `galaxy/collection.py` file. Specifically, the error suggests that the `apis` variable is not iterable when it is expected to be.

Reason for Occurrence: 
The `from_name` function is expecting the `apis` variable to be iterable, but it is being passed a single `GalaxyAPI` object instead. This mismatch in the data type is causing the `TypeError`.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check how the `apis` variable is being initialized and passed to the `from_name` function to ensure that it is iterable. If it is not iterable, it may need to be wrapped in a container that makes it iterable (e.g., a list).
2. Modify the `from_name` function to handle a single `GalaxyAPI` object as input instead of expecting an iterable.

Corrected Code:

```python
def verify_collections(collections, search_paths, apis, validate_certs, ignore_errors, allow_pre_release=False):

    with _display_progress():
        with _tempdir() as b_temp_path:
            for collection in collections:
                try:
                    # existing code as it is

                    # Download collection on a galaxy server for comparison
                    try:
                        remote_collection = CollectionRequirement.from_name(collection[0], [apis], collection[1], False, parent=None,
                                                                            allow_pre_release=allow_pre_release)
                        # Corrected the above line to pass [apis] as a list to make it iterable
                    except AnsibleError as e:
                        if e.message == 'Failed to find collection %s:%s' % (collection[0], collection[1]):
                            raise AnsibleError('Failed to find remote collection %s:%s on any of the galaxy servers' % (collection[0], collection[1]))
                        raise
                    # existing code as it is
                except AnsibleError as err:
                    if ignore_errors:
                        display.warning("Failed to verify collection %s but skipping due to --ignore-errors being set. "
                                        "Error: %s" % (collection[0], to_text(err)))
                    else:
