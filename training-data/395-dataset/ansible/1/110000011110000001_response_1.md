The error occurs because the `apis` parameter in the `from_name` method is expected to be an iterable, but it is being passed as a single object in the `verify_collections` method. This causes a TypeError because a single object is not iterable.

To fix this, the `apis` parameter in the `verify_collection` method should be wrapped in a list or another iterable so that it can be iterated over correctly in the `from_name` method.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def verify_collections(collections, search_paths, apis, validate_certs, ignore_errors, allow_pre_release=False):

    with _display_progress():
        with _tempdir() as b_temp_path:
            for collection in collections:
                try:
                    # existing code ...

                    # Download collection on a galaxy server for comparison
                    try:
                        remote_collection = CollectionRequirement.from_name(collection_name, [apis], collection_version, False, parent=None, allow_pre_release=allow_pre_release)
                    except AnsibleError as e:
                        if e.message == 'Failed to find collection %s:%s' % (collection[0], collection[1]):
                            raise AnsibleError('Failed to find remote collection %s:%s on any of the galaxy servers' % (collection[0], collection[1]))
                        raise

                    # existing code ...

                except AnsibleError as err:
                    if ignore_errors:
                        display.warning("Failed to verify collection %s but skipping due to --ignore-errors being set. "
                                        "Error: %s" % (collection[0], to_text(err)))
                    else:
                        raise
```
