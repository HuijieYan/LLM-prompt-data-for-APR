The error seems to be occurring in the `fetch_role_related` method of the `GalaxyAPI` class. The method is supposed to fetch the related items for a given role from the Galaxy API, but it seems to be constructing the URL incorrectly, leading to the installation of older versions of roles instead of the latest version.

The issue seems to be related to how the URL is constructed using the `_urljoin` method. It looks like the URL is being constructed by joining the `api_server` and `available_api_versions['v1']`, but it's not appending the `/api` part of the `api_server`. This leads to an incorrect URL being constructed, causing the wrong version of the role to be fetched.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the URL is constructed correctly using the `api_server` and `available_api_versions['v1']` while also including the `/api` part of the `api_server`.

Here's the corrected code for the `fetch_role_related` method:
```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

# this is the corrected function
@g_connect(['v1'])
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        url = urljoin(urljoin(self.api_server, 'api'), urljoin(self.available_api_versions['v1'], f"roles/{role_id}/{related}/?page_size=50"))
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                     % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```
This corrected code will ensure that the URL is constructed correctly and that the latest version of the role is fetched from the Galaxy API.
