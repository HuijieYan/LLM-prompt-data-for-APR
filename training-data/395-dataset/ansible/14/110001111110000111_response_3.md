The error message from the test function indicates an AssertionError in the URL comparison. It seems that the URL being generated in the fetch_role_related method is incorrect, causing the test to fail.

The issue is likely occurring because the _urljoin function is not being used properly to generate the URL for the API call. The fetch_role_related method is attempting to construct the URL using _urljoin, but it's not providing the correct arguments to create the URL.

To fix the bug, the fetch_role_related method needs to use the _urljoin function correctly to construct the URL for the API call. Additionally, the available_api_versions method appears to be incorrectly defined and should be reviewed as well to ensure it is functioning as intended.

Here's the corrected code for the fetch_role_related method:

```python
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """
    results = []
    try:
        api_version = self.available_api_versions()[0]  # Assuming available_api_versions returns a list of available versions
        url = _urljoin(self.api_server, api_version, "roles", str(role_id), related) + "?page_size=50"
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                     % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```

This code assumes that the available_api_versions method returns a list of available versions, and it takes the first version to construct the URL. Additionally, it uses str(role_id) to convert the role_id to a string when constructing the URL.

The available_api_versions method should be reviewed separately to ensure it returns the expected values for the fetch_role_related method to use.
