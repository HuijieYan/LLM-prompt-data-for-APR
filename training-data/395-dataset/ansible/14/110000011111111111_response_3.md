The error occurs in the `fetch_role_related` function when constructing the `url` variable. The issue is caused by combining the `self.api_server` and `self.available_api_versions['v1']` in the wrong way, resulting in an incorrect URL.

To fix this issue, the `url` variable should be constructed by properly joining the parts of the URL using the `_urljoin` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `fetch_role_related` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin as _urljoin

def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        url = _urljoin(self.api_server, _urljoin(self.available_api_versions['v1'], f"roles/{role_id}/{related}/?page_size=50"))
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                     % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```

In the corrected code, the `url` variable is constructed using the `_urljoin` properly, and the URL is formed correctly. This should resolve the issue and produce the expected results.
