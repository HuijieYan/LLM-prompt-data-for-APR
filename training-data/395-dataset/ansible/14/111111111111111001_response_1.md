The error occurs because the `url` variable in the `fetch_role_related` method is not being constructed correctly. It's appending the base URL twice, resulting in an incorrect URL.

The bug lies in the `_urljoin` method where the URL is being concatenated. It appears that the `base_url` is not being used properly. It is also possible that the two elements of the URL are being joined in an incorrect format leading to the duplication of the base URL.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the `base_url` is used properly and that the URL is constructed in a correct format.

Below is the corrected code for the `fetch_role_related` method:

```python
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        url = _urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions['v1'], "roles", str(role_id), related, "?page_size=50")
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv(
            "Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
            % (role_id, related, to_text(e))
        )
    return results
```

In the corrected code, the `role_id` is converted to a string using `str(role_id)` to ensure it's concatenated properly. Additionally, the parameters passed to `_urljoin` have been formatted correctly to generate the URL.
