The potential error in the code lies in the _urljoin function that is used to construct the URL. The issue seems to be related to the concatenation of the base URL and the available API version. It appears that the concatenation is not being handled properly, resulting in an incorrect URL.

The bug occurs because the function _urljoin is not concatenating the base URL and the version correctly, resulting in erroneous URL construction.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the concatenation of the base URL and the available API versions is done correctly. This can be achieved by modifying the _urljoin function to handle the concatenation of the URL parts properly.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
# Corrected function
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        url = f"{self.api_server}v1/roles/{role_id}/{related}/?page_size=50"
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = self._call_galaxy(data['next_link'])
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                     % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```

In the corrected code, we directly construct the URL using f-strings, ensuring that the base URL and the version are concatenated properly. This should fix the bug and ensure that the URL is constructed correctly.
