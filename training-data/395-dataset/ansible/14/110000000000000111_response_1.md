The issue described seems to be related to the Ansible Galaxy API or the ansible-galaxy command, causing the installation of an older version of a role rather than the latest version.

Looking at the provided function `fetch_role_related`, the potential error location is in the construction of the `url` variable. It seems that the version 'v1' is hardcoded and not being utilized correctly with the `g_connect` decorator.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not utilizing the correct API version for fetching the related items for the given role.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct API version is being used when constructing the URL.

The corrected function would be:

```python
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        url = _urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions[self.api_version], "roles", role_id, related,
                       "?page_size=50")
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                     % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```

In the corrected function, we are using `self.api_version` to fetch the available API version dynamically, ensuring that the correct version is used in constructing the URL.
