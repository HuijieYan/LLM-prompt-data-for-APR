The error seems to be related to the `fetch_role_related` function in the `GalaxyAPI` class not being able to retrieve the latest version of a role from the Ansible Galaxy server. This is evident from the user's complaint that an older version of the role is being installed instead of the latest one.

The potential error location within the `fetch_role_related` function is the way it constructs and calls the URL to fetch the role-related data from the Ansible Galaxy server.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug could be incorrect URL construction or retrieval logic within the `fetch_role_related` function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the logic for constructing the URL to ensure that it requests the latest version of a role from the Ansible Galaxy server.
2. Ensure that the correct API endpoint or URL is being used to fetch the role-related data.
3. Check for any outdated or incorrect logic that might be causing the function to retrieve an older version of the role.

Here's the corrected code for the `fetch_role_related` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

class GalaxyAPI():
    """
    This class is meant to be used as a API client for an Ansible Galaxy server 
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
        """
        Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
        The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
        """
        results = []
        try:
            url = urljoin(self.api_server, f"roles/{role_id}/{related}/?page_size=50")
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results = data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
            while not done:
                url = urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
                data = self._call_galaxy(url)
                results += data['results']
                done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        except Exception as e:
            display.vvvv(f"Unable to retrieve role (id={role_id}) data ({related}), but this is not fatal so we continue: {to_text(e)}")
        return results
```
