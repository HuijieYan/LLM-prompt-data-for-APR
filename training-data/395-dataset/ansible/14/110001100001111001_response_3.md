Error location and issue:
The error is occurring in the line `url = _urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions['v1'], "roles", role_id, related, "?page_size=50")`. The issue is with the parameter arrangement and a missing comma between the `related` and the query string.

Reason behind the bug:
The bug is occurring because the parameters are not being passed correctly to the `_urljoin` function. As a result, the URL is not being constructed properly, leading to incorrect calls to the Galaxy API.

Approach for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to rearrange the order of the parameters passed to `_urljoin` and ensure that the comma between the `related` and the query string is added.

Corrected code:

```python
@g_connect(['v1'])
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """
    results = []
    try:
        url = _urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions['v1'], "roles", str(role_id), related + "/",
                       "?page_size=50")
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                     % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```
