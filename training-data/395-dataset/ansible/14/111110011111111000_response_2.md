```

The fix was to remove the `@g_connect(['v1'])` decorator from the `fetch_role_related` function.

The errors in the test function are related to incorrect URLs being compared. This may be caused by an inconsistency between the URL formatting and the expected URL. The `fetch_role_related` function does not perform any URL manipulation, so the issue may be somewhere else in the code.
