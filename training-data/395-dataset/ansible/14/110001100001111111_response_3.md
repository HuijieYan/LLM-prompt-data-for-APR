The bug is likely in the `fetch_role_related` method. The `url` variable is being constructed using the `available_api_versions` dictionary, but the method `available_api_versions` is not a method of the current class, it's actually a method from the parent class `GalaxyAPI`. This is likely causing the URL to be constructed incorrectly and retrieve older versions of the role.

To fix this bug, we need to call the method `available_api_versions` from the `GalaxyAPI` class and use the correct URL to fetch the role related items.

```python
# corrected function
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """
    results = []
    try:
        url = self._urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions()['v1'], "roles", role_id, related, "?page_size=50")
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = self._urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s" % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```

In the corrected code:
- We use `self._urljoin` and `self._call_galaxy` to access the methods from the parent class.
- We call the `available_api_versions` method with `()` to get the value from the dictionary that represents the available API versions.

This corrected code should resolve the issue of fetching older versions of the role and ensure that the latest version is installed.
