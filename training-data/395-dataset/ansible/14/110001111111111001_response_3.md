The error occurs in the `fetch_role_related` function, specifically in the generation of the `url` variable. The issue is related to the concatenation of URL parts using the `_urljoin` function, which results in an incorrect URL.

The bug occurs because the `_urljoin` function is not being used correctly. It is likely that the function does not handle the base_url correctly, resulting in incorrect URL construction.

To fix this bug, the `_urljoin` function needs to be used properly by passing the base URL and other parts of the URL as arguments to construct the complete URL.

Here's the corrected code for the `fetch_role_related` function:

```python
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        base_url = self.api_server
        version = self.available_api_versions['v1']
        url = _urljoin(base_url, version, "roles", str(role_id), related) + "?page_size=50"
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = _urljoin(base_url, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv(f"Unable to retrieve role (id={role_id}) data ({related}), but this is not fatal so we continue: {to_text(e)}")
    return results
``` 

The `_urljoin` function is used to correctly construct the complete URL by concatenating base_url, version, role_id, related, and other query parameters. This should address the issue and produce the expected URL for the API call.

This correction should resolve the bug and align the function's behavior with the expected functionality.
