The bug is likely located in the `fetch_role_related` function. The `url` is constructed using the `available_api_versions['v1']`, which is a dictionary, causing an error when trying to concatenate it with a string.

The bug occurs because the `available_api_versions` attribute is a dictionary, and in the code, it is used as if it were a function. The code attempts to access a key in the dictionary using square brackets, but the code appears to intend to call a function with the same name and access the key from the result.

To fix the bug, the correct function call should be `self.available_api_versions()['v1']` instead of `self.available_api_versions['v1']`.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        url = _urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions()['v1'], "roles", role_id, related,
                       "?page_size=50")
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                     % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```

With this change, the code should function as expected and retrieve the correct version of the role.
