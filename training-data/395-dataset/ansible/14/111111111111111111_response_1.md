The error in the test case is due to the URL being formed incorrectly in the buggy function. The URL is being formed by concatenating the base URL, API version, and additional path components. In Buggy case 2, the URL formed is `'https://galaxy.com/api/api/v1/roles/432/versions/?page=2&page_size=50'`, which contains an extra `/api` segment.

This is happening because the `_urljoin` function used to join the URL components is not producing the expected URL.

To fix this bug, you should modify the `_urljoin` function to correctly join the URL components without introducing extra path segments. Ensure that the base URL and API version are joined properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_urljoin` function:

```python
import urllib.parse

def _urljoin(*args):
    """
    Join parts of URL into a single URL.
    """
    url = '/'.join(map(lambda x: str(x).strip('/'), args))
    return urllib.parse.urljoin(url, '/')
```

After making the above changes, the corrected form of the buggy function should look like this:

```python
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        url = _urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions['v1'], "roles", role_id, related)
        params = {'page_size': 50}
        data = self._call_galaxy(url, args=params)
        results = data['results']
        next_link = data.get('next_link', None)
        while next_link:
            data = self._call_galaxy(next_link)
            results += data['results']
            next_link = data.get('next_link', None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrive role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                     % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
``` 

By making these changes, the test function provided should run without errors, and the correct version of the role should be installed when using the `ansible-galaxy install` command.
