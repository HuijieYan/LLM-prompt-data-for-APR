The bug in the `fetch_role_related` function is related to the construction of the `url` variable, specifically concerning the extraction of the version key from `self.available_api_versions`. The function is incorrectly trying to access a dictionary as if it were a callable function using square brackets instead of parentheses. This causes the constructed URL to contain extra 'api/' in it, which was not the intended behavior.

To fix the bug, the `self.available_api_versions` should be accessed as a dictionary using square brackets and the 'v1' key as shown in the expected case. This approach is consistent with the provided input and expected parameters.

Updated and corrected code for the `fetch_role_related` function:

```python
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        url = _urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions['v1'], "roles", role_id, related,
                       "?page_size=50")
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                     % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```
