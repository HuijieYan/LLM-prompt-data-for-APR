The bug is related to the Ansible Galaxy API installing an older version of the role instead of the latest version. The error occurs in the fetch_role_related function, where it seems to be fetching the wrong version of the role due to an issue with the URL generation.

The potential error location within the function is the URL generation and retrieval of the role data from the Galaxy API.

The reason behind the bug is that the URL generation for fetching the related items for the given role might not be constructing the correct URL to fetch the latest version.

To fix the bug, you need to make sure that the URL being constructed includes the correct version number of the role and also handle any exceptions that may occur during the data retrieval process.

Here's the corrected code for the fetch_role_related function:

```python
@g_connect(['v1'])
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id, version="3.7.0"):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        url = _urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions['v1'], "roles", role_id, related, version, "?page_size=50")
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                     % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```

In the corrected code, a version parameter is added to the function signature with a default value of "3.7.0". This version parameter is then used to construct the URL along with the role_id and related items. This ensures that the correct version of the role is fetched from the Galaxy API. Additionally, the exception handling is improved to provide more informative error messages.
