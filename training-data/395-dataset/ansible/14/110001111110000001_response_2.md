The error occurs in the `test_get_role_versions_pagination` test case. It attempts to assert that `mock_open.mock_calls[1][1][0]` contains a specific URL, but the assertion fails due to the incorrect URL being generated by the `fetch_role_related` method.

The bug is likely located in the `fetch_role_related` method. The `url` generation logic seems to be incorrectly composed, resulting in the malformed URL that the test case cannot match.

To fix this bug, the `fetch_role_related` method should construct the `url` properly by using the `_urljoin` method, and the `available_api_versions` method should be called directly instead of accessing it as an attribute.

Here's the corrected code for the `fetch_role_related` method:

```python
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        available_versions = self.available_api_versions()
        url = _urljoin(self.api_server, available_versions[0], "roles", role_id, related, "?page_size=50")
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrive role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                     % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```

With this correction, the `fetch_role_related` method should now generate the correct URL, resolving the bug and allowing the test case to pass.
