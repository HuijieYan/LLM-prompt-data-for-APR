The bug seems to be related to the `fetch_role_related` function in the `GalaxyAPI` class. The function is not properly using the available API versions to build the API URL for fetching role-related items.

The error message from the GitHub issue indicates that an older version of the role is being installed instead of the expected latest version. This suggests that the function is not correctly constructing the URL to fetch the latest version of the role-related items.

The bug occurs due to the URL construction in the `fetch_role_related` function. The function is using the wrong URL format, which leads to fetching older versions of role-related items instead of the latest version.

To fix the bug:
1. Use the available API versions dictionary to construct the URL for fetching role-related items.
2. Ensure that the URL constructed points to the latest version of the role-related items.

Here's the corrected code for the `fetch_role_related` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

class GalaxyAPI():
    """
    This class is meant to be used as a API client for an Ansible Galaxy server
    """
    
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the fixed function
    def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
        """
        Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
        The URL comes from the 'related' field of the role.
        """
        
        results = []
        try:
            url = urljoin(self.api_server, f"api/{self.available_api_versions['v1']}/roles/{role_id}/{related}/?page_size=50")
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results = data['results']
            while data.get('next_link'):
                url = urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
                data = self._call_galaxy(url)
                results += data['results']
        except Exception as e:
            display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                         % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
        return results
```

In the corrected code, the `urljoin` function is used to construct the URL using the API server, available API version, role ID, and related item. This ensures that the correct URL is formed to fetch the latest version of role-related items.
