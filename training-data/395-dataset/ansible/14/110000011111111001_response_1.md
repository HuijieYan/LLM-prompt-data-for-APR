The error occurs in the `fetch_role_related` function because it incorrectly constructs the URL using `_urljoin` and does not handle it properly when the base URL already contains `/api/`. This leads to the duplication of `/api/` in the URL.

To fix this issue, the `_urljoin` function or its usage should be modified to handle the case where the base URL already contains `/api/`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import os
from urllib.parse import urljoin

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        api_base_url = self.api_server
        if api_base_url.endswith('/api/'):
            api_base_url = os.path.dirname(self.api_server.rstrip('/'))

        url = urljoin(urljoin(api_base_url, self.available_api_versions['v1']), f"roles/{role_id}/{related}/?page_size=50")
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = urljoin(api_base_url, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv(f"Unable to retrieve role (id={role_id}) data ({related}), but this is not fatal so we continue: {str(e)}")
    return results
```

In this corrected version, the base URL without `/api/` is constructed, and the `urljoin` function is used to create the full URL. This will ensure that the URL is properly constructed regardless of whether the base URL contains `/api/` or not.
