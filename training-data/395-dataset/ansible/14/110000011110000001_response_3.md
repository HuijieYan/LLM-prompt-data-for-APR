The error occurs when the test function `test_get_role_versions_pagination` compares two URLs. The problematic part is on line 909 in the test file. The error message indicates that the first URL is incorrectly formatted.

The potential error location in the code is the `_urljoin` function. It seems to be generating an incorrect URL format.

The bug occurs because the `urljoin` function is not joining the URLs correctly. This results in an incorrect URL, causing the test function to fail.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to review the implementation of the `_urljoin` function and ensure that it correctly joins the base URL with the path and query parameters.

Here's the corrected code for the `fetch_role_related` function:

```python
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        url = self.api_server + '/api/' + self.available_api_versions['v1'] + '/roles/' + role_id + '/' + related + '/?page_size=50'
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            if 'next_link' in data and data['next_link']:
                url = self.api_server + data['next_link']
                data = self._call_galaxy(url)
                results += data['results']
                done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
            else:
                done = True
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s" % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```
