The issue seems to be related to the `fetch_role_related` function in the `ansible/galaxy/api.py` file, which is used to fetch related items for a given role. The issue is that it is fetching the older version of the role instead of the latest version.

The potential error location within the `fetch_role_related` function is likely in the way the URL is constructed and handled when fetching the role-related data.

The bug occurs because the function is not correctly constructing the URL for fetching the role-related data. It is using the `available_api_versions` method as a dictionary, which is incorrect, and not using the `args` provided to the `_urljoin` method.

To fix the bug, the function needs to construct the URL correctly using the `_urljoin` method and the provided arguments for the base URL and the role-related data. Additionally, it should handle the pagination logic properly to fetch all the related items.

The corrected code for the `fetch_role_related` function is as follows:

```python
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """
    results = []
    try:
        url = _urljoin(self.api_server, "v1", "roles", role_id, related) + "?page_size=50"
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']

        while 'next_link' in data:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']

        return results
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv(f"Unable to retrieve role (id={role_id}) data ({related}), but this is not fatal so we continue: {to_text(e)}")
        return results
```

In the corrected code, the URL is constructed using the `_urljoin` method with the correct arguments, and the pagination logic is handled to fetch all related items. Additionally, the exception handling has been improved to provide a more detailed error message.
