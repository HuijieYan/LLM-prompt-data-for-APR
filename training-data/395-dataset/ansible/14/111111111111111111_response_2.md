The error in the code is the incorrect construction of the URL in the `fetch_role_related` method. The method incorrectly concatenates the base URL, API version, and role information to form the complete URL. This results in a double 'api' in the URL, causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, the URL construction logic needs to be reviewed and corrected to ensure that the URL is formed correctly.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The URL comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        url = _urljoin(self.api_server, "v1", "roles", str(role_id), related, "?page_size=50")
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv(f"Unable to retrieve role (id={role_id}) data ({related}), but this is not fatal so we continue: {to_text(e)}")
    return results
```

With this corrected code, the URL construction logic has been updated to properly form the URL without the duplicate 'api' segment. This should resolve the issue reported in the test and provide the expected results.
