The issue seems to be related to the `fetch_role_related` function in the `GalaxyAPI` class. It appears that the function is not correctly fetching the latest version of the role from the Galaxy server.

Based on the provided information, here's the corrected version of the `fetch_role_related` function:

```python
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        url = _urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions['v1'], "roles", str(role_id), related, "?page_size=50")
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            if 'next_link' in data:
                url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
                data = self._call_galaxy(url)
                results += data['results']
                done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
            else:
                done = True
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s" % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```

For the first expected case, the function should now work correctly and return the expected results. For the second expected case, the corrected function also includes a condition to handle the case where the 'next_link' field is not present in the data.

This should resolve the issue of the older version of the role being installed when using the `ansible-galaxy` command.
