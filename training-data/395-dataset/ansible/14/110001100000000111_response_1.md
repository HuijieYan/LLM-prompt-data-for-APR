The error occurs in the `fetch_role_related` function, specifically in the URL generation. The function attempts to join the `available_api_versions` list with the role_id and related, but it mistakenly uses square brackets instead of parentheses to access the `available_api_versions` function, resulting in a TypeError. This error causes the function to use an incorrect URL when fetching the role related items, leading to the installation of an older version of the role.

To fix the bug, the `available_api_versions` function should be invoked correctly and the URL generation logic should be adjusted to ensure it uses the correct API version for fetching the role related items.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@g_connect(['v1'])
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The URL comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        api_versions = self.available_api_versions()  # Correctly invoke available_api_versions
        url = _urljoin(self.api_server, api_versions['v1'], "roles", role_id, related, "?page_size=50")  # Adjust URL generation logic
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                     % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```
