The error occurs within the `fetch_role_related` function of the `GalaxyAPI` class. The issue is likely caused by the incorrect URL construction in the `fetch_role_related` function, which leads to the incorrect assertion in the test function.

To fix the bug, the URL construction in the `fetch_role_related` function needs to be corrected. Instead of using direct string concatenation to construct the URL, the `_urljoin` method should be used to construct the complete URL.

The corrected `fetch_role_related` function is as follows:

```python
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    results = []
    try:
        url = self._urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions['v1'], "roles", role_id, related) + "?page_size=50"
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = self._urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s" % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```

By using the `_urljoin` method, the correct URLs will be constructed, and the assertion in the test function should pass without any issues.
