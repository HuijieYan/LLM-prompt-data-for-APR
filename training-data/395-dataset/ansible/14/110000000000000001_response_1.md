We don't have the definition of the `@g_connect` decorator, so I will assume that this is not causing the bug.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the way the URL is being constructed and called.

The bug in this code is that the `_urljoin` function is not being properly called to join the URL segments, and the `self._call_galaxy(url)` function is not handling errors properly.

To fix the bug, we need to properly construct the URL and handle errors when making the API call.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected function
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        url = _urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions['v1'], "roles", str(role_id), related) + "?page_size=50"
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        while 'next_link' in data:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv(f"Unable to retrieve role (id={role_id}) data ({related}), but this is not fatal so we continue: {str(e)}")
    return results
```

In the corrected code, we properly construct the URL using `_urljoin`, handle the pagination inside the while loop, and handle the exceptions properly. Also, it is important to convert `role_id` to a string before using it in the URL.
