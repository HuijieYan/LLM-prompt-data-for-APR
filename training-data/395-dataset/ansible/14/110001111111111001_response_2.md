The error occurs because the url is not being constructed correctly in the buggy function. 

The bug occurs in the construction of the URL using `_urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions['v1'], "roles", role_id, related, "?page_size=50")` method.

To fix the bug, the URL construction needs to be updated to ensure it is formed correctly. This can be achieved by updating the function call `_urljoin` parameters.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@g_connect(['v1'])
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        url = _urljoin(self.api_server, "api", self.available_api_versions['v1'], "roles", str(role_id), related + "/", "?page_size=50")
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                     % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```
