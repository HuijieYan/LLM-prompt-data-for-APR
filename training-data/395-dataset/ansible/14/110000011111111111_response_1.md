The bug appears to be in the _urljoin function, where the URL is being constructed incorrectly. The function is joining the base_url and the next_link without considering that the next_link already includes the base_url. This is causing the URL to be duplicated.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the _urljoin function to properly handle the joining of URLs.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

@g_connect(['v1'])
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        url = urljoin(self.api_server, f"v1/roles/{role_id}/{related}/?page_size=50")
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        while 'next_link' in data and data['next_link']:
            url = self._urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv(f"Unable to retrieve role (id={role_id}) data ({related}), but this is not fatal so we continue: {to_text(e)}")
    return results
```

In the corrected code, we use the urljoin function to properly join the base_url with the additional path segments and query parameters. We also improve the logic for fetching paginated results by checking for the presence of a next_link in the response data.

These changes should address the issue and prevent the duplication of URLs, resolving the bug.
