The error message shows that there is an assertion error in the test. The test is failing because the constructed URL in the test doesn't match the expected URL. This means there is an issue with how the URL is being constructed in the `fetch_role_related` method.

The potential error location is likely in the portion of the code where the URL is being constructed using `_urljoin`. The issue might be related to missing or incorrect path components in the URL.

The bug is occurring because the `_urljoin` function is not constructing the URL appropriately. It seems that the base URL is being doubled in the constructed URL, leading to an incorrect URL.

To fix this bug, the `_urljoin` function should construct the URL using the correct base URL, API version, and other components. It should ensure that the base URL and other components are merged correctly without duplication of any parts of the URL.

Here's the corrected code for the `fetch_role_related` method:

```python
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The URL comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        url = _urljoin(self.api_server, f"{self.available_api_versions['v1']}/roles/{role_id}/{related}/?page_size=50")
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv(f"Unable to retrieve role (id={role_id}) data ({related}), but this is not fatal so we continue: {to_text(e)}")
    return results
```

In the corrected code, the URL is constructed using string formatting to ensure that the base URL and other components are merged correctly. This should resolve the issue of the URL being constructed incorrectly.
