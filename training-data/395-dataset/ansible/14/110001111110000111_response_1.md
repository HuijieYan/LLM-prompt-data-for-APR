The error in the provided code is occurring due to the incorrect construction of the URL in the `fetch_role_related` function. The `url = _urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions['v1'], "roles", role_id, related, "?page_size=50")` line is constructing the URL incorrectly, resulting in the wrong URL being used when fetching role related data.

The correct approach to fixing this bug is to modify the `url = _urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions['v1'], "roles", role_id, related, "?page_size=50")` line to ensure that the URL is constructed correctly.

The corrected code for the `fetch_role_related` function is as follows:

```python
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        url = _urljoin(self.api_server, "api", "v1", "roles", str(role_id), related) + "/?page_size=50"
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                     % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```

In the corrected code:
- The construction of the URL has been modified to ensure that it follows the correct format.
- The `_urljoin` function is used to concatenate the parts of the URL.
- The `related` parameter is used directly in the URL construction.
- The `page_size=50` parameter is appended to the constructed URL.

With these changes, the `fetch_role_related` function should now construct the URL correctly and fetch the role related data without the previous error.
