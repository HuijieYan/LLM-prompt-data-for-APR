The error seems to be related to the incorrect construction of the URL in the `fetch_role_related` method of the GalaxyAPI class. It's possible that the `available_api_versions` method is not being called properly to retrieve the API version when constructing the URL.

The bug occurs due to the incorrect use of `self.available_api_versions` as a method instead of a dictionary. The `available_api_versions` method should be called to retrieve the API version value.

To fix the bug, the `available_api_versions` method should be called to retrieve the API version value. Additionally, the URL construction logic should be updated to ensure the correct formation of the URL.

Here's the corrected code for the `fetch_role_related` method:

```python
import urllib.parse
# ... omitted code ...

class GalaxyAPI():
    # ... omitted code ...

    def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
        results = []
        try:
            api_version = self.available_api_versions()['v1']
            url = urllib.parse.urljoin(self.api_server, f"api/{api_version}/roles/{role_id}/{related}/?page_size=50")
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results = data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
            while not done:
                url = urllib.parse.urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
                data = self._call_galaxy(url)
                results += data['results']
                done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        except Exception as e:
            display.vvvv(f"Unable to retrieve role (id={role_id}) data ({related}), but this is not fatal so we continue: {to_text(e)}")
        return results
```

In the corrected code:
- The `available_api_versions` method is called as a function to retrieve the API version value.
- The URL construction logic has been updated using `urllib.parse.urljoin` to ensure the correct formation of the URL.
