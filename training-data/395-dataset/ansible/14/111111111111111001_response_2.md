The error is occurring because the buggy function is not correctly constructing the URL using the _urljoin method. The incorrect URL construction is causing the test case to fail.

The bug is present in the line:
```python
url = _urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions['v1'], "roles", role_id, related, "?page_size=50")
```

The function _urljoin is not being used correctly. It should be used to join the parts of the URL, but it's not being used in a way that allows the multiple components to be joined properly.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the way the URL is being constructed. Also, a check should be added to ensure that the parts of the URL are joined correctly using _urljoin.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        url_parts = [self.api_server, self.available_api_versions['v1'], "roles", str(role_id), related]
        url = _urljoin(*url_parts)
        url += "?page_size=50"
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrive role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                     % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```
