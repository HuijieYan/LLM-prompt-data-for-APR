The error in the test function occurs when asserting the URL called by the function `mock_open` with the specified parameters. The actual URL does not match the expected URL, leading to an assertion error.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `fetch_role_related` function. The URL construction using the `_urljoin` function and the `_call_galaxy` function call might be causing the incorrect URL generation.

The bug occurs because the `fetch_role_related` function incorrectly constructs the URL using the `_urljoin` and `_call_galaxy` functions, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual URLs, causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the URL construction in the `fetch_role_related` function is done correctly by using the `_urljoin` function to join the URL components and then using the resulting URL with `_call_galaxy` to fetch the role-related data.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    results = []
    try:
        url = _urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions()['v1'], "roles", role_id, related, "?page_size=50")
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                     % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```

In the corrected code, the `available_api_versions` function is correctly called with `()`, and the URL construction using `_urljoin` and data retrieval using `_call_galaxy` is fixed based on the expected behavior. This should resolve the issue observed in the test function.
