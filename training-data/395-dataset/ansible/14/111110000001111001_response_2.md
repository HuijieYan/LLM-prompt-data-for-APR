The buggy function `fetch_role_related` is supposed to fetch a list of related items for a given role from an Ansible Galaxy server. However, there is an error in the construction of the URL, which leads to incorrect URL formation.

The potential error location in the code seems to be the URL construction in the `fetch_role_related` function.

The bug occurs because the `_urljoin` function is not being used in the correct way to construct the URL. Additionally, there is a missing import statement for `_urljoin`.

To fix the bug, the `urllib.parse.urljoin` should be used to construct the URL instead of `_urljoin`. Additionally, the correct import statement for `urljoin` should be added to the code.

Here's the corrected code for the `fetch_role_related` function with the necessary import statement for `urljoin`:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

class GalaxyAPI():
    """
    This class is meant to be used as a API client for an Ansible Galaxy server 
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def available_api_versions(self):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def _call_galaxy(self, url, args=None, headers=None, method=None, auth_required=False, error_context_msg=None):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
        """
        Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
        The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
        """

        results = []
        try:
            url = urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions['v1'] + f"/roles/{role_id}/{related}/?page_size=50")
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results = data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
            while not done:
                url = urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
                data = self._call_galaxy(url)
                results += data['results']
                done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        except Exception as e:
            display.vvvv(f"Unable to retrieve role (id={role_id}) data ({related}), but this is not fatal so we continue: {to_text(e)}")
        return results
```

With this correction, the URL is constructed using `urljoin` from the `urllib.parse` module, ensuring that the URLs are formed correctly.
