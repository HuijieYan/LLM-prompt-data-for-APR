The potential error location within the problematic function is the way the `@g_connect(['v1'])` decorator is being used. It seems like it is expecting the function to accept additional arguments, but the function signature does not reflect that.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the decorator is not applied correctly and is expecting additional arguments that the function is not receiving.

To fix the bug, we can remove the decorator and handle the version "v1" inside the function itself.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def fetch_role_related(self, version, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        url = _urljoin(self.api_server, version, "roles", role_id, related, "?page_size=50")
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                     % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```
