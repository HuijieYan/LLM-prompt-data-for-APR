The error occurs in the `fetch_role_related` function when constructing the `url` variable. The issue is caused by incorrect URL concatenation using `_urljoin`. It seems that the base URL is being repeated due to a discrepancy in the input data processing.

To fix this bug, the URL construction logic needs to be revised. The base URL should be concatenated with the path segments and query parameters using the appropriate method. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the URL is constructed correctly regardless of the input data.

Here's the corrected code for the `fetch_role_related` function:

```python
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    results = []
    try:
        url = f"{self.api_server}/v1/roles/{role_id}/{related}/?page_size=50"
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)

        while not done:
            url = self.api_server + data['next_link']
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                     % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```

By directly concatenating the path segments and query parameters to the base URL, we ensure that the URL is constructed properly. Additionally, using an f-string for URL construction improves readability and reduces the risk of concatenation errors.
