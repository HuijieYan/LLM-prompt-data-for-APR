The error in the provided function seems to be related to the incorrect fetching of the role version from the Galaxy API. This is evident from the fact that the user is expecting the latest version (3.7.0) to be installed, but an older version (3.6.3) is being installed instead.

The bug appears to be in the `fetch_role_related` function, particularly in the way the URL is constructed for fetching the role data from the API. The function is using the `self.available_api_versions['v1']` as a function instead of a dictionary to retrieve the API version, which leads to the URL being constructed incorrectly and thus fetching the wrong version of the role.

To fix this bug, the function should use the `available_api_versions` method that is defined in the same file to retrieve the API version. Additionally, the function should ensure that it correctly handles the URL construction and retrieval of the role data.

Here is the corrected code for the `fetch_role_related` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        api_version = self.available_api_versions()['v1']
        url = _urljoin(self.api_server, api_version, "roles", role_id, related, "?page_size=50")
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s" % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```
