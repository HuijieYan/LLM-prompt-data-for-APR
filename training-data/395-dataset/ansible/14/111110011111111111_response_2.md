The error message in the test function indicates that the url being generated in the `fetch_role_related` function is incorrect. It seems to be duplicating the `/api` part in the url.

The bug occurs because in the `fetch_role_related` function, the `_urljoin` method concatenates the `self.api_server` and `self.available_api_versions['v1']` which results in the `'/api'` being repeated in the url.

To fix the bug, you can directly use the `self.fetch_api_server` instead of `self.api_server` in the url generation process.

Here's the corrected code for the `fetch_role_related` function:

```python
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        url = _urljoin(self.fetch_api_server(), "v1", "roles", role_id, related, "?page_size=50")
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = _urljoin(self.fetch_api_server(), data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                     % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```

By using `self.fetch_api_server()` and removing `self.available_api_versions['v1']` from the url generation process, the bug should be fixed as it will now correctly form the URL without duplicating the `'/api'` part.
