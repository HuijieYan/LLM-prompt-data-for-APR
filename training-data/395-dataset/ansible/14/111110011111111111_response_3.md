The error in the function is likely the construction of the `url` variable within the `fetch_role_related` method. The issue stems from the function `_urljoin` being called with arguments that do not correctly create the desired URL.

The bug occurs because the `_urljoin` function is likely not properly joining the URL components, resulting in a malformed URL. This is indicated by the error message from the test function, which shows a mismatch in the constructed URL compared to the expected URL.

To fix this bug, the function `_urljoin` needs to be properly utilized to construct the URL with the given components. It is important to ensure that the URL is correctly constructed by verifying the input arguments and how they are used within the `_urljoin` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `fetch_role_related` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

class GalaxyAPI():
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _urljoin(self, *args):
        return urljoin(*args)

    @g_connect(['v1'])
    def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
        results = []
        try:
            url = self._urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions['v1'], "roles", str(role_id), related, "?page_size=50")
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results = data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
            while not done:
                url = self._urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
                data = self._call_galaxy(url)
                results += data['results']
                done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        except Exception as e:
            display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s" % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
        return results
```

In the corrected code, the `url` variable is constructed using the `self._urljoin` method, and the components are passed in the correct order to ensure the URL is properly formed. Additionally, the `role_id` is explicitly converted to a string before being used in the URL. The `_urljoin` method is defined within the `GalaxyAPI` class to use the `urljoin` method from the `urllib.parse` module.

By making these changes, the bug related to the construction of the `url` variable should be resolved.
