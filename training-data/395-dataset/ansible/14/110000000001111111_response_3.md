The issue appears to be related to the `fetch_role_related` method in the `GalaxyAPI` class not returning the expected results. The `fetch_role_related` method is supposed to fetch the list of related items for a given role, and the URL comes from the 'related' field of the role.

The bug seems to be occurring in the construction of the `url` variable, which is formed using the `_urljoin` function. Additionally, there are issues in handling the pagination of the API request.

The bug occurs because the `url` is not being constructed correctly, especially when the `available_api_versions` dictionary is being accessed. Additionally, the pagination logic seems to have some issues, as it doesn't correctly construct the URLs for subsequent requests.

To fix the bug, the `_urljoin` function needs to be modified to correctly construct the URL with the available API version. Additionally, the pagination logic should be updated to construct the correct URLs for subsequent requests.

Here's the corrected code for the `fetch_role_related` method:

```python
# Corrected function
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    results = []
    try:
        url = "{}/v1/roles/{}/{}?page_size=50".format(self.api_server, role_id, related)
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        while 'next_link' in data and data['next_link']:
            url = data['next_link']
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s" % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```

In this corrected code, the URL is constructed directly using string formatting, and the pagination logic has been updated to correctly handle subsequent requests.
