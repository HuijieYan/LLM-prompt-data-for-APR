Potential error location: 

The error could potentially be in the url construction and retrieval process using the `_urljoin` and `_call_galaxy` functions. 

Reasons for the bug: 

1. The `available_api_versions` function is defined as a method, but it is used as a property. This could cause a bug, as it is not being called correctly.
2. The use of `self.available_api_versions` suggests that `available_api_versions` should be a method that belongs to the same class. However, it is not defined as a method within the provided code.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 

1. Define `available_api_versions` as a method within the same class to access the available API versions correctly.
2. Use the defined `available_api_versions` method to retrieve the API version instead of trying to access it as a property.


Corrected code for the problematic function: 

```python
# this is the corrected function
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        api_version = self.available_api_versions()
        url = _urljoin(self.api_server, api_version, "roles", role_id, related,
                       "?page_size=50")
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrive role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                     % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```
