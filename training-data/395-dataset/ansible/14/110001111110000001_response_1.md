The error message shows an assertion error related to a URL mismatch. It seems that the URL generated by the `fetch_role_related` function is not the same as expected, leading to the test failure.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `_urljoin` function call. The way the URL is constructed might not be correct.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the `_urljoin` function concatenates the URL components properly to form a valid URL. Another approach is to verify the input parameters for the `_urljoin` function to identify any discrepancies.

Here's the corrected code for the `fetch_role_related` function:

```python
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        url = _urljoin(self.api_server, 'api', 'v1', "roles", str(role_id), related) + "?page_size=50"
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrive role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                     % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```

In the corrected code, the `url` variable is constructed using the `_urljoin` function by providing the components of the URL (such as `self.api_server`, 'api', 'v1', "roles", and the `related` parameter) as separate arguments. The appropriate separators and formatting are used to ensure that the resulting URL is constructed correctly.
