The error is occurring in the `fetch_role_related` function of the `GalaxyAPI` class. The function is making an API call to retrieve data related to a role, and it is expecting the `next_link` field in the response to be a valid URL for pagination. However, in the test code, the URL being checked for the second call is incorrect. It should be `https://galaxy.com/api/v1/roles/432/versions/?page=2&page_size=50`, but the test is comparing it with `https://galaxy.com/api/api/v1/roles/432/versions/?page=2&page_size=50`. 

The bug occurs because the `_urljoin` function is not constructing the URL properly. The first part of the URL is duplicated.

To fix the bug, the `_urljoin` function should be modified to construct the URL properly and avoid duplication.

The corrected code for the `fetch_role_related` function is as follows:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

class GalaxyAPI():
    """
    This class is meant to be used as a API client for an Ansible Galaxy server 
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
        """
        Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
        The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
        """
    
        results = []
        try:
            url = urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions['v1'] + "/roles/" + str(role_id) + "/" + related + "?page_size=50")
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results = data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
            while not done:
                url = urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
                data = self._call_galaxy(url)
                results += data['results']
                done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        except Exception as e:
            display.vvvv("Unable to retrive role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                         % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
        return results
```

The changes made include using `urljoin` for constructing the URL and removing the `_urljoin` function. This should address the bug and ensure that the URL is constructed correctly for the API call, resolving the issue in the test function.
