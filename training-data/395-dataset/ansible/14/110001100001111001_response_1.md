The bug is occurring in the `fetch_role_related` function. It uses the `_urljoin` function to construct a URL and then makes a call to the `_call_galaxy` function. The error may be occurring in the construction of the URL. 

The issue seems to be in the construction of the URL using the `_urljoin` function, which is likely causing the incorrect URL in some cases as shown in Buggy case 2 where the URL is `'https://galaxy.com/api/api/v1/roles/432/versions/?page=2&page_size=50'`. This suggests that there may be a problem with the concatenation of URLs.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the construction of the URL to ensure it is formed correctly. 

Here's the corrected code for the `fetch_role_related` function:

```python
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    results = []
    try:
        url = _urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions['v1'], "roles", str(role_id), related) + "/?page_size=50"
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv(f"Unable to retrieve role (id={role_id}) data ({related}), but this is not fatal so we continue: {str(e)}")
    return results
```

In this corrected version, the URL is constructed using the `_urljoin` function to concatenate the different parts of the URL. This should help in resolving the issue of incorrect URL construction.
