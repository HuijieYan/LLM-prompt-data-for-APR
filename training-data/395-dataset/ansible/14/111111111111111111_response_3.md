The error is occurring when the function `fetch_role_related` tries to construct the `url` using the `self.available_api_versions['v1']` in the line:
```python
url = _urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions['v1'], "roles", role_id, related, "?page_size=50")
```
In Python, dictionary access using brackets can raise a KeyError if the key is not present.

The potential causes of the bug are:
1. The key 'v1' might not be present in `self.available_api_versions`.
2. The test cases are indicating that the URL is not being constructed correctly.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key 'v1' is present in `self.available_api_versions` and then use it to construct the URL. Additionally, we need to ensure that the URL is constructed correctly according to the test requirements.

Here's the corrected code for the `fetch_role_related` function:

```python
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    results = []
    try:
        if 'v1' in self.available_api_versions:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions['v1'], "roles", str(role_id), related) + "?page_size=50"
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results = data['results']
            done = data.get('next_link') is None
            while not done:
                url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
                data = self._call_galaxy(url)
                results += data['results']
                done = data.get('next_link') is None
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                     % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the key 'v1' exists in `self.available_api_versions`. Then we construct the URL using the available API version. Additionally, we concatenate the query parameter `page_size=50` to the URL to match the expected test case behavior.
