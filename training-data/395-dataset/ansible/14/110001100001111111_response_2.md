The bug seems to be in the url creation for the API call in the `fetch_role_related` function. It is creating the URL incorrectly, leading to older versions of roles being installed.

The bug appears to be in the URL generation part of the `fetch_role_related` function. The function is creating the URL using the `self.available_api_versions` dictionary which maps the available API versions but it is not being accessed correctly.

It seems the function is not using the provided API versions to construct the URL. Instead, it is hardcoded to use 'v1', leading to the incorrect URL being formed and older versions of roles being fetched.

To fix this bug, we need to use the correct API version from the `self.available_api_versions` dictionary to construct the URL. Additionally, we need to address potential page navigation issues that might be causing older versions of the roles to be fetched.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
@g_connect(['v1'])
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        api_version = self.available_api_versions['v1']
        url = _urljoin(self.api_server, api_version, "roles", role_id, related, "?page_size=50")
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                     % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```

In the corrected function, we first access the API version from the `self.available_api_versions` dictionary and then use it to construct the URL. This should ensure that the correct API version is used to fetch the roles, and should fix the issue of older roles being fetched.
