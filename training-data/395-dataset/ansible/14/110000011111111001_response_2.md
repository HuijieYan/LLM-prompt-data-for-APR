The error occurs at the assertion where the URL being tested for in the test case doesn't match the actual URL returned by the function `fetch_role_related()`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the construction of the `url` variable. It seems that the URL generation logic is incorrect.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `url` is not being constructed properly.

To fix the bug, the `_urljoin` function call should be reviewed and checked for any discrepancies in URL manipulation. Also, the logic used to concatenate the URL may need to be revised based on the input parameters `self.api_server` and `self.available_api_versions['v1']`.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
# this is the fixed function
@g_connect(['v1'])
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        url = "{}/v1/roles/{}/{}?page_size=50".format(self.api_server, role_id, related)
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = self.api_server + data['next_link'] if 'next_link' in data else None
            if url:
                data = self._call_galaxy(url)
                results += data['results']
                done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
            else:
                done = True
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                     % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```
