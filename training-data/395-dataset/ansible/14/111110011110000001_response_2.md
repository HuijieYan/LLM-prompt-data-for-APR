The error occurs when the test tries to assert the URL passed to `mock_open.mock_calls[1][1][0]`, which is expected to be 'https://galaxy.com/api/v1/roles/432/versions/?page=2&page_size=50'. However, the actual URL obtained is 'https://galaxy.com/api/api/v1/roles/432/versions/?page=2&page_size=50'.

The error is likely due to the incorrect construction of the URL in the `fetch_role_related` function. The issue may be in the implementation of the URL concatenation.

To fix the bug, the URL concatenation logic in the `fetch_role_related` function should be corrected.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

# class declaration containing the buggy function
class GalaxyAPI():
    """
    This class is meant to be used as an API client for an Ansible Galaxy server 
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def available_api_versions(self):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def _call_galaxy(self, url, args=None, headers=None, method=None, auth_required=False, error_context_msg=None):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # this is the corrected function
    @g_connect(['v1'])
    def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
        """
        Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
        The URL comes from the 'related' field of the role.
        """
    
        results = []
        try:
            url = urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions['v1'], "roles", str(role_id), related, "?page_size=50")
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results = data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
            while not done:
                url = urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
                data = self._call_galaxy(url)
                results += data['results']
                done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        except Exception as e:
            display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                         % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
        return results
```

By using `urljoin` from the `urllib.parse` module, the corrected function ensures the correct concatenation of the URL components, preventing the previously observed bug.
