The error in the test case occurs when trying to compare the URLs. One of the URLs contains an extra '/api' in it, leading to the assertion error. The root cause of the bug is that the _urljoin function is not properly handling the URL construction. It seems to be adding an extra '/api' in the URL, leading to the mismatch in the test case.

To fix the bug, the _urljoin function needs to be modified to correctly construct the URL without adding the extra '/api'. 

Additionally, the decorator @g_connect(['v1']) should be removed as it is not utilized within the provided function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        url = f"{self.api_server}/api/v1/roles/{role_id}/{related}/?page_size=50"
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = f"{self.api_server}{data['next_link']}"
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv(f"Unable to retrieve role (id={role_id}) data ({related}), but this is not fatal so we continue: {to_text(e)}")
    return results
```
