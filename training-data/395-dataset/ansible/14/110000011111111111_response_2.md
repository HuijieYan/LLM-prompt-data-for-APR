The error is occurring due to a discrepancy in the URL formation in the `fetch_role_related` function. In the second test case, the URL formed is incorrect, leading to the test failure.

The bug occurs in the URL formation within the `fetch_role_related` method. The bug is causing the wrong URL to be formed, leading to incorrect data retrieval. This is evident from the assertion error in the test case.

The issue occurs due to incorrect URL concatenation using `_urljoin` method, which leads to an extra 'api' being added to the URL in the second test case.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the URL formation is correct for all test cases. This can be achieved by revising the logic for URL formation in the `fetch_role_related` method.

The correct code for the `fetch_role_related` function is as follows:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

# this is the corrected function
@g_connect(['v1'])
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        url = urljoin(self.api_server, f"v1/roles/{role_id}/{related}/?page_size=50")
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                     % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```

In the corrected code, the `urljoin` method from the `urllib.parse` module is used to accurately concatenate the URL components. This ensures that the correct URL is formed for all test cases.
