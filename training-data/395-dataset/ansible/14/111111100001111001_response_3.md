The bug occurs in the URL construction within the `fetch_role_related` function. The `url` is generated using `_urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions['v1'], "roles", role_id, related, "?page_size=50")` and the `self.api_server` contains an extra `/api` at the end, resulting in a double `/api` in the URL.

To fix this, we need to remove the `/api` from the end of `self.api_server` while constructing the URL.

Here is the corrected code for the `fetch_role_related` function:

```python
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """
    results = []
    try:
        url = _urljoin(self.api_server.rstrip('/'), self.available_api_versions['v1'], "roles", str(role_id), related, "?page_size=50")
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server.rstrip('/'), data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrive role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                     % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```

By using `self.api_server.rstrip('/')` instead of `self.api_server` while constructing the URL, we ensure that any trailing slashes are removed. This prevents the duplication of `/api` and results in the correct URL construction.
