The error is due to the incorrect generation of the URL in the `fetch_role_related` method. The method uses `_urljoin` method to concatenate URLs, and it does not work as expected because it adds `api` twice in the URL.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `_urljoin` method adds `api` twice in the URL. When the `related` field is concatenated with the URL in `_urljoin`, it adds an extra `/api` in the URL, which causes the incorrect URL generation.

The bug can be fixed by removing the `api` from the concatenated URL in the `_urljoin` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `fetch_role_related` method:

```python
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        url = _urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions['v1'], "roles", role_id, related + "/",
                       "?page_size=50")
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = _urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                     % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```

By removing the `/api` from the concatenation of the URL in the `_urljoin` method, this bug should be fixed, and the URL generation should work correctly.
