The error is likely in the `_urljoin()` call within the `fetch_role_related` method. The error message appears related to the incorrect construction of the URL. The method `_urljoin` should be called using `self._urljoin` instead of just `_urljoin`.

Reasons for the occurrence of the bug:
The method `_urljoin` is expected to be a method of the GalaxyAPI class, and it seems to be used to join parts of a URL. However, instead of calling it as a method of the class, it is called directly, resulting in a NameError. 

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
The function `_urljoin` should be called as a method of the class using `self._urljoin` to ensure that the method is properly invoked.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the fixed function
@g_connect(['v1'])
def fetch_role_related(self, related, role_id):
    """
    Fetch the list of related items for the given role.
    The url comes from the 'related' field of the role.
    """

    results = []
    try:
        url = self._urljoin(self.api_server, self.available_api_versions['v1'], "roles", str(role_id), related,
                        "?page_size=50")
        data = self._call_galaxy(url)
        results = data['results']
        done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
        while not done:
            url = self._urljoin(self.api_server, data['next_link'])
            data = self._call_galaxy(url)
            results += data['results']
            done = (data.get('next_link', None) is None)
    except Exception as e:
        display.vvvv("Unable to retrieve role (id=%s) data (%s), but this is not fatal so we continue: %s"
                        % (role_id, related, to_text(e)))
    return results
```
