The error message indicates that the expected redirected URL (`http://scrapytest.org/a%C3%A7%C3%A3o`) does not match the actual redirected URL (`http://scrapytest.org/a%C3%83%C2%A7%C3%C3%83%C2%A3o`). This suggests that the issue may be due to incorrect URL encoding.

The problematic section of the code is likely the conversion of the location header to a native string and then joining it with the request URL. This is causing the incorrect URL encoding.

The reason behind the bug is the incorrect handling of URL encoding when processing the "Location" header.

To fix the bug, the URL encoding of the "Location" header should be handled properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` function:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = response.headers.getlist('Location')[0].decode('utf-8')  # Decode the location header using utf-8

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

In this corrected code, we are using `decode('utf-8')` to correctly handle the URL encoding for the "Location" header. This should resolve the bug and make the function work as expected.
