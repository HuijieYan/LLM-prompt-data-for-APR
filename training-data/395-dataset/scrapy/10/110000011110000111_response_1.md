The test_utf8_location function is testing the process_response method of the RedirectMiddleware class. The test creates a Request object and a Response object with a UTF-8 encoded Location header. It then calls the process_response method with these objects and checks if the URL of the result matches the expected value. The error message shows that the response URL does not match the expected URL, indicating a bug in the process_response method.

The potential error location within the process_response method is the decoding of the Location header. The method attempts to decode the 'Location' header value using latin1 encoding, and then constructs a new URL based on the decoded location.

The bug occurs because the 'Location' header is encoded using UTF-8, but the method attempts to decode it using latin1. This leads to incorrect decoding and construction of the redirected URL.

To fix the bug, the process_response method should decode the 'Location' header using UTF-8 encoding instead of latin1.

Here's the corrected code for the process_response method:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = response.headers.get('location').decode('utf-8')  # Decode using UTF-8

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```
