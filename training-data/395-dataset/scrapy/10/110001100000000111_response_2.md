The bug occurs in the `process_response` function in the given code. The issue is with the decoding of the "Location" header using the `latin1` encoding, which results in incorrect URL redirection.

The bug occurs because the response header "Location" is decoded using the `latin1` encoding, which may not be appropriate for all cases. This causes issues when the redirect URL contains non-ascii characters.

To fix this bug, the response header "Location" should be decoded using the correct encoding, which is likely to be `utf-8` in most cases. Additionally, the response status codes handling and URL redirection logic should be reviewed and adjusted if necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` function:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = response.headers['location'].decode('utf-8')  # decode using utf-8 encoding

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

In the corrected code, the decoding of the "Location" header is done using the `utf-8` encoding, and the URL redirection logic remains the same. This should address the bug related to incorrect decoding of the redirected URL.
