The test case `test_utf8_location` creates a `Request` object and a `Response` object with a UTF-8 encoded `Location` header. The test then calls the `process_response` method of a class (not provided) passing in the `Request`, `Response`, and a spider object. The test checks for the equality of the processed URL with an expected URL and fails.

The error message indicates a mismatch between the expected URL and the processed URL. It seems that the URL is not being correctly processed and encoded.

The potential error location within the `process_response` method might be the `to_native_str` and `urljoin` functions. It seems that these functions are not correctly handling the UTF-8 encoding of the URL passed in the `Location` header.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not handling the UTF-8 encoded URL correctly, leading to an incorrect processed URL.

To fix the bug, the `to_native_str` and `urljoin` functions need to be modified to handle the UTF-8 encoded URL properly. The `decode('latin1')` operation should be removed and the URL should be decoded using UTF-8 encoding.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` method:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = response.headers.get('location').decode('utf-8')

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```
