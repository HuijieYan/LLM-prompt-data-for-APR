The error occurs in the `process_response` function of the `RedirectMiddleware` class. The issue is related to decoding the "Location" header using the latin1 encoding, which leads to incorrect redirection URLs.

The bug occurs because the function is using the `to_native_str` method to decode the "Location" header, which is causing the URL to be incorrectly decoded. This results in the assertion error in the test case.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly handle the decoding of the "Location" header to ensure that the redirected URL is properly decoded and percent-encoded.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` function:

```python
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urljoin

class RedirectMiddleware(BaseRedirectMiddleware):
    """
    Handle redirection of requests based on response status and meta-refresh html tag
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
                response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
            return response

        allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307)
        if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
            return response

        location = response.headers.get('location').decode('utf-8')
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

        if response.status in (301, 307) or request.method == 'HEAD':
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

In the corrected code, the `response.headers.get('location').decode('utf-8')` line is used to properly decode the "Location" header using the UTF-8 encoding. This ensures that the redirected URL is correctly decoded and percent-encoded, resolving the bug.
