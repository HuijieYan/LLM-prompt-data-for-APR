The bug is caused by the incorrect decoding of the "Location" header using latin1 encoding. This leads to the generation of an incorrect redirected URL.

To fix the bug, the decoding of the "Location" header should be corrected to use the correct encoding (UTF-8) and handle percent-encoded URLs properly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = response.headers.getlist('Location')[0].decode('utf-8')
    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

In this corrected code, the "Location" header is decoded using the correct UTF-8 encoding. Additionally, the method `getlist` is used to retrieve the "Location" header value as a list and then decoded. Finally, the `urljoin` function is used to properly handle the percent-encoded URL and generate the redirected URL.
