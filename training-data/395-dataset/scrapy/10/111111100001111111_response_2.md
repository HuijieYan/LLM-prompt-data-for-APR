The bug occurs in the `process_response` function of the `RedirectMiddleware` class. The issue is related to the decoding of the "Location" header on redirects using latin-1, which can result in an incorrect URL. The bytes received are UTF-8 encoded and not percent-escaped, leading to incorrect decoding.

To fix the bug, the decoding of the "Location" header should be adjusted to handle UTF-8 encoded bytes and perform proper percent-escaping. This will ensure that the redirected URL is correctly decoded and constructed.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from urllib.parse import unquote

class RedirectMiddleware(BaseRedirectMiddleware):
    """
    Handle redirection of requests based on response status and meta-refresh html tag
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
                response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
            return response
    
        allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307)
        if b'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
            return response
    
        # HTTP header is ascii or latin1, redirected url is percent-encoded utf-8
        location = response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8')
        redirected_url = unquote(urljoin(request.url, location))
    
        if response.status in (301, 307) or request.method == 'HEAD':
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
    
        redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

In the corrected code, we use `decode('utf-8')` to properly decode the "Location" header as UTF-8 encoded bytes. We then use `urllib.parse.unquote` to percent-decode the URL and construct the correct redirected URL. This ensures that the decoded URL is correctly formed and avoids the incorrect decoding issue.
