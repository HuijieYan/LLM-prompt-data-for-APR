The test case `test_utf8_location` is trying to encode a URL containing non-ASCII characters in UTF-8 and then verify if the `process_response` function can correctly handle the encoding and return the expected percent-encoded URL.

The error message indicates that the encoded URL returned by the `process_response` function is not matching the expected percent-encoded URL, which suggests that there might be an issue with Unicode and encoding/decoding in the `process_response` function.

The bug is likely occurring in the `process_response` function when handling the `Location` header containing non-ASCII characters and encoding/decoding it inappropriately, resulting in the incorrect encoded URL.

To fix the bug, the `Location` header should be decoded from 'latin1' encoding and then encoded to 'utf-8'. The decoded URL should then be joined with the request URL using `urljoin` to ensure the correct formation of the new URL.

Here's the corrected `process_response` function:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response
    
    allowed_status = {301, 302, 303, 307}  # Changed to set for faster lookup
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response
    
    # HTTP header is ascii or latin1, redirected url will be percent-encoded utf-8
    location = response.headers['Location'].decode('latin1')
    location = location.encode('utf-8')
    
    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)
    
    if response.status in {301, 307} or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
    
    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

With the corrected function, the URL encoding and decoding should now work correctly, and the test case `test_utf8_location` should pass without any assertion errors.
