The test case `test_utf8_location` is trying to encode a URL using UTF-8 and then compare it to the expected percent-encoded UTF-8 URL. However, the comparison is failing with an AssertionError.

The potential error location within the `process_response` function is the decoding of the location header using 'latin1'. This is causing the URL to be decoded incorrectly, leading to the mismatch in the comparison.

The reason behind this bug is that the location header is being decoded using the wrong encoding, which results in the incorrect URL.

To fix this bug, the location header should be decoded using the correct encoding, which is UTF-8. This will ensure that the URL is correctly decoded and then percent-encoded.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` function:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    # Decode the location header using UTF-8
    location = to_native_str(response.headers['location'].decode('utf-8'))

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

By decoding the location header using UTF-8, the bug should be fixed and the comparison in the test case should now pass.
