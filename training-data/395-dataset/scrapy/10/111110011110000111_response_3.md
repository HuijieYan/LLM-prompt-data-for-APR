The test case `test_utf8_location` is checking the functionality of the `process_response` method of the `RedirectMiddleware` class. The error message indicates that the expected URL after processing the response does not match the actual URL.

The bug is likely located in the processing of the `'Location'` header in the `process_response` method. The issue seems to be related to the decoding of the header using the 'latin1' encoding, which results in an incorrect URL.

The bug occurs because the function is assuming that the 'Location' header is encoded using the 'latin1' encoding when it is actually encoded using UTF-8. This causes incorrect decoding of the special characters in the URL.

To fix the bug, the function should decode the 'Location' header using the UTF-8 encoding instead of the 'latin1' encoding. This will properly handle the special characters in the URL.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` method:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (
        request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False)
        or response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])
        or response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', [])
        or request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)
    ):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = response.headers['location'].decode('utf-8')
    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```
In this corrected code, the 'Location' header is decoded using the 'utf-8' encoding to properly handle the special characters in the URL.
