The error message indicates that there is an issue with encoding the URL, resulting in a mismatch between the expected URL and the actual URL.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the encoding of the URL in the `process_response` method, particularly in the following lines:
```python
location = to_native_str(response.headers['location'].decode('latin1'))
redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)
```

The bug occurs because the URL is being decoded as latin1, which is causing the encoding mismatch in the test case.

To fix the bug, the URL should be decoded using utf-8 encoding instead of latin1. After decoding, the URL should be percent-encoded to ensure the correct encoding is applied before joining it with the request URL.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` method:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    # Decoding the URL using utf-8
    location = response.headers['location'].decode('utf-8')
    # Encoding the URL to percent-encoded utf-8
    redirected_url = quote(location, safe='/?:=')  # to ensure that whole URL is properly encoded

    if response.status in (301, 307) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```
