The potential error in the provided code is that the function `process_response` is not properly implemented and might be resulting in unexpected behavior when processing the response.

The bug appears to be related to how the `redirected_url` is being generated and then used in the subsequent conditional statements.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `redirected_url` is properly generated and applied to the `redirected` request.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` function:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    # HTTP header is ascii or latin1, redirected url will be percent-encoded utf-8
    location = to_native_str(response.headers['Location'].decode('latin1'))

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

In the corrected code, we fixed the issue with extracting the 'Location' header and generating the `redirected_url` by using `response.headers['Location']` instead of `response.headers['location']`, and then used `urljoin` to properly construct the `redirected_url`. Also, we used `to_native_string` to decode the location. Lastly, we used the proper case for `Location` in `response.headers['Location']`.
