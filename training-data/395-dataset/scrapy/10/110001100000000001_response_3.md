Potential error location: 
The potential error location in the code is the use of the `_redirect` and `_redirect_request_using_get` functions within the `process_response` function. It seems like these functions are not defined within the same class as the `process_response` function, which could cause the code to fail when trying to call them.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug is occurring because the `_redirect` and `_redirect_request_using_get` functions are being referenced within the `process_response` method, but they are not defined within the same class.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
One possible approach for fixing the bug is to make sure that the `_redirect` and `_redirect_request_using_get` functions are defined within the same class as the `process_response` method. This will allow them to be called from within the `process_response` method without any issues.

Corrected code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_10/scrapy/downloadermiddlewares/redirect.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def _redirect(self, redirected, request, spider, reason):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def _redirect_request_using_get(self, request, redirect_url):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

class RedirectMiddleware(object):
    def _redirect(self, redirected, request, spider, reason):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def _redirect_request_using_get(self, request, redirect_url):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
                response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
            return response
    
        allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307)
        if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
            return response
    
        # HTTP header is ascii or latin1, redirected url will be percent-encoded utf-8
        location = to_native_str(response.headers['location'].decode('latin1'))
    
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)
    
        if response.status in (301, 307) or request.method == 'HEAD':
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
    
        redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
