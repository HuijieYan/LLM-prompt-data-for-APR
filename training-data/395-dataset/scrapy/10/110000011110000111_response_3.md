The error occurs in the `process_response` function, specifically in the following code block:

```python
location = to_native_str(response.headers['location'].decode('latin1'))
```

The reason for the bug is that the `location` header is being decoded using the 'latin1' encoding, which is incorrect. The original header is UTF-8 encoded, so decoding it with 'latin1' results in incorrect characters. This leads to the test case failing, as it expects the corrected URL to be 'http://scrapytest.org/a%C3%A7%C3%A3o' but instead gets 'http://scrapytest.org/a%C3%83%C2%A7%C3%83%C2%A3o'.

To fix the bug, the `location` header should be decoded using the correct encoding, which in this case is UTF-8.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` function:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = response.headers['location'].decode('utf-8')
    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```
