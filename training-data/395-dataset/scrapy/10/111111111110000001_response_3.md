The test case `test_utf8_location` is checking if the response URL is correctly encoded from a UTF-8 location header. The `req_result.url` is expected to match the `perc_encoded_utf8_url`.

The error message indicates that the encoded URL in the response is not matching the expected value. This discrepancy is due to incorrect decoding and encoding of the UTF-8 location header.

The bug is likely occurring in the line `redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)`. It seems that the encoding and decoding of the URL are not handled correctly, leading to the mismatch in the response URL.

To fix the bug, the URL encoding and decoding should be done properly to handle UTF-8 characters.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` function:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    # HTTP header is ascii or latin1, redirected url will be percent-encoded utf-8
    location = to_native_str(response.headers['location'].decode('latin1'))
    
    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

In the corrected code, the `location` variable is properly decoded using `decode('latin1')` and the `redirected_url` is created by joining the `request.url` with the decoded `location`. This will ensure that UTF-8 characters are handled correctly and the response URL is encoded as expected.
