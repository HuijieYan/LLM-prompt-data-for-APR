The bug seems to be related to the encoding of non-ASCII characters in the URL. The response.headers['Location'] is being decoded as 'latin1', which is causing the issue with non-ASCII characters.

To fix the bug, we need to decode the location using the 'utf-8' encoding and then percent-encode the URL. 

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin, quote

def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307)
    if b'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    # HTTP header is ascii or latin1, redirected url will be percent-encoded utf-8
    location = response.headers[b'Location'].decode('utf-8')
    location = quote(location)  # Percent-encode the URL

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

In the corrected code:
- We decode the `Location` header using the 'utf-8' encoding.
- We then percent-encode the `location` using the `quote` method to ensure that non-ASCII characters are correctly encoded in the URL.
- The rest of the code remains the same.
