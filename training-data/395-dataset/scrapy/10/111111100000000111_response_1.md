The bug occurs in the `process_response` function of the `RedirectMiddleware` class. The issue is with the decoding of the "Location" header using the latin-1 encoding, which can lead to incorrect handling of the redirected URL.

The bug occurs because the code attempts to decode the "Location" header using latin-1 encoding, but in some cases, the "Location" header contains UTF-8 encoded characters and not percent-escaped characters. This results in the decoded URL being incorrect.

To fix the bug, a possible approach would be to modify the decoding process of the "Location" header. Instead of assuming it is always latin-1 encoded, the code should first check the encoding of the "Location" header and then decode it accordingly. Additionally, handling the percent-escaped characters correctly is necessary to ensure the correct redirection.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` function of the `RedirectMiddleware` class:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (
        request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False)
        or response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])
        or response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', [])
        or request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)
    ):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = response.headers['location'].decode(response.headers.get_content_charset(failobj='utf-8'))
    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

In the corrected code, the `decode` method used for the "Location" header takes into account the actual encoding of the header, determined using `response.headers.get_content_charset(failobj='utf-8')`. This way, the decoding process is adjusted based on the actual encoding, ensuring correct handling of the redirected URL.
