The bug in the provided code seems to be related to the encoding and decoding of the "Location" header in the response. The response.headers['location'] is being decoded using 'latin1', but it should be decoded using 'utf-8' to properly handle non-ASCII characters.

Additionally, the encoding and decoding process isn't consistent across the function. The location is being decoded from 'latin1', but the redirected_url is not being encoded to 'utf-8' after being generated.

To fix the bug, the following corrections need to be made:
1. Decode the response.headers['location'] using 'utf-8' instead of 'latin1'.
2. Encode the redirected_url to 'utf-8' after generating it.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = to_native_str(response.headers['location'].decode('utf-8'))  # decoding using utf-8

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location).encode('utf-8')  # encoding to utf-8

    if response.status in (301, 307) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```
