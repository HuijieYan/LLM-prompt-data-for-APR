The test case `test_utf8_location` is supposed to test if the function `process_response` correctly processes responses with UTF-8 encoded headers. The error message indicates that the expected URL after processing the response does not match the actual URL.

The potential error location within the `process_response` function is the conversion of the UTF-8 encoded location to a native string. This step might be causing the issue.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the conversion of the UTF-8 encoded location to a native string is incorrect, leading to the generation of an incorrect redirected URL.

To fix the bug, the decoding and encoding steps for the location should be handled accurately.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` function:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = response.headers.getlist('Location')[0].decode('utf-8')

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

In the corrected code, the location is decoded using 'utf-8' encoding, and there is no conversion to a native string. This approach ensures that the redirected URL is correctly generated.
