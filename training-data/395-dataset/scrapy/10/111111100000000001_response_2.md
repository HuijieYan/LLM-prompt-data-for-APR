The potential error in the `process_response` function is the use of the `_redirect` and `_redirect_request_using_get` methods. The function seems to be trying to call these methods as if they were instance methods, but they are defined as private methods within the class `RedirectMiddleware`.

The error occurs because these private methods should be called within the class instance using `self._redirect` and `self._redirect_request_using_get`, but they are currently being called without the `self` reference. This is causing a NameError when the `process_response` function tries to access these methods.

To fix the bug, we need to add the `self` reference when calling these private methods.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` function:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    # HTTP header is ascii or latin1, redirected url will be percent-encoded utf-8
    location = to_native_str(response.headers['location'].decode('latin1'))

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```
