The potential error location within the problematic function is the line that retrieves the value of the 'SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS' setting. The bug is likely related to the renaming of SpiderManager to SpiderLoader, as well as the renaming of the setting from SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS to SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to use the correct setting name 'SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS' and handle the deprecation warning properly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import warnings
from zope.interface.verify import verifyClass
from scrapy.interfaces import ISpiderLoader
from scrapy.utils.misc import load_object

def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS')
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```

In this corrected code, we have updated the line to retrieve the value of the 'SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS' setting, and we no longer use the deprecated 'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS' setting. We also handle the deprecation warning as specified in the GitHub issue title.
