The test case 'test_spidermanager_deprecation' is trying to check if the 'runner.spider_loader' is an instance of 'CustomSpiderLoader', but it is currently failing with an AssertionError.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the '_get_spider_loader' function where the 'loader_cls' is being retrieved and used to instantiate a SpiderLoader instance.

The bug is occurring because the 'loader_cls' is not being instantiated correctly, which is resulting in an instance of 'SpiderLoader' instead of 'CustomSpiderLoader'.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the 'loader_cls' is correctly instantiated based on the provided class path. We also need to make sure that the correct class instance is returned by the function.

Here's the corrected code for the '_get_spider_loader' function:

```python
import warnings
from scrapy.utils.deprecate import ScrapyDeprecationWarning
from zope.interface.verify import verifyClass
from scrapy.interfaces import ISpiderLoader
from scrapy.utils.misc import load_object

def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS',
                            settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'))
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls(settings)  # instantiate class with settings as argument
```

In the corrected code, the 'loader_cls' is instantiated with the 'settings' passed as an argument, and the correct class instance based on the class path is returned by the function.
