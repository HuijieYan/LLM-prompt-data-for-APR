The buggy function `_get_spider_loader` is designed to return a SpiderLoader instance based on the input settings. The issue is with the cls_path variable and how it is being used to load the loader_cls. 

The code is retrieving the cls_path from the settings and then loading the corresponding class using `load_object(cls_path)`. However, in the buggy case, the cls_path is set to `'tests.test_crawler.CustomSpiderLoader'`, which is a custom SpiderLoader class defined in a different module. This may not be the expected behavior, as the cls_path should ideally resolve to the default SpiderLoader class provided by Scrapy.

In order to fix this bug, the cls_path should be set to the correct default SpiderLoader class provided by Scrapy, and then use it to load the loader_cls.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
from scrapy.spiderloader import SpiderLoader

def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS')
    
    if not cls_path:
        loader_cls = SpiderLoader
    else:
        loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```

In this corrected code, we explicitly set the cls_path to `settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS')` and then load the corresponding loader_cls using `load_object(cls_path)`. If SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS is not defined in the settings, we default to the standard SpiderLoader provided by Scrapy. This should ensure that the correct SpiderLoader class is always used, resolving the bug.
