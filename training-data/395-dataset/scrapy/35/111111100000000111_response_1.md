The buggy function is `_get_spider_loader(settings)` which is meant to return a SpiderLoader instance from the settings. The bug is related to the deprecation warning for the `SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS` option and the usage of `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS`.

The potential error location is the use of `settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS')` and `settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS', settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'))`.

The reason behind the bug is that the function is using deprecated options and not handling the deprecation warning properly.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to handle the deprecation warning and use the correct option for `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS`. Additionally, we should consider removing the usage of deprecated options if possible.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS')
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```

In this corrected code, we have removed the usage of `settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS')` and directly used `settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS')`. We have also handled the deprecation warning properly.
