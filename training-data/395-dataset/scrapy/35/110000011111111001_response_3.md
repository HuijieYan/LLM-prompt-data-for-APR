The error occurs because the `runner.spider_loader` is not an instance of `CustomSpiderLoader`, as expected in the test case. This indicates that the `_get_spider_loader` function is not returning the correct `SpiderLoader` class.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())`. The `from_settings` method should be called on the `loader_cls` class, not an instance of it.

The bug occurs because the `from_settings` method of the loader class is being called on the class itself, rather than an instance of the class. As a result, the returned spider loader is not an instance of `CustomSpiderLoader`, causing the test to fail.

To fix this bug, the `from_settings` method should be called on an instance of the `loader_cls` class, not the class itself. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the correct `SpiderLoader` class is used based on the settings provided.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS',
                            settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'))
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    loader_instance = loader_cls()
    return loader_instance.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```

In the corrected code, an instance of the `loader_cls` class is created using `loader_cls()`, and then the `from_settings` method is called on this instance. This ensures that the correct `SpiderLoader` class is used based on the settings provided, and the test case should pass as expected.
