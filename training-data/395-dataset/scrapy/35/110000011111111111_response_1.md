The test case 'test_spidermanager_deprecation' is failing because the buggy function is returning an instance of 'scrapy.spiderloader.SpiderLoader' instead of 'tests.test_crawler.CustomSpiderLoader' as expected.

The potential error in the function is with the variable 'cls_path' and the subsequent 'loader_cls' that is instantiated using 'load_object(cls_path)'. This variable 'cls_path' is being retrieved from the settings using 'settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS', settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'))'. 

The reason behind the bug is that the 'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS' option is deprecated, and it is now expected to use 'SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS'. 

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to use the 'SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS' if available in the settings. If not available, a default value can be provided. Once the correct 'cls_path' is obtained, the 'loader_cls' should be instantiated accordingly. 

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import warnings
from scrapy.utils.misc import load_object
from scrapy.interfaces import ISpiderLoader
from scrapy.settings import Settings

def _get_spider_loader(settings: Settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS', 'scrapy.spiderloader.SpiderLoader')
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```

With this correction, the function will retrieve the correct class path from the settings, instantiate the correct loader class, and return an instance of the specified spider loader class.
