Potential error location within the problematic function:
The issue seems to be related to the `from_settings` method call in the `_get_spider_loader` function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect instantiation of the spider loader object, which is not the expected `CustomSpiderLoader` instance.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct spider loader class is instantiated and returned.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import warnings
from scrapy.utils.misc import load_object
from zope.interface.verify import verifyClass
from scrapy.interfaces import ISpiderLoader

def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS',
                            settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'))
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls(settings)
```

In the corrected code, I have changed the `from_settings` method to simply call the spider loader class with the `settings` object passed as an argument. This will ensure that the correct spider loader class is instantiated and returned.
