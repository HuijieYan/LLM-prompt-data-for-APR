The provided function `_get_spider_loader` is trying to retrieve a SpiderLoader instance from the settings. It seems that there is a deprecation warning for the 'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS' option, advising to use 'SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS' instead. Additionally, the function is attempting to load the SpiderLoader class using `load_object` and then verifying if it implements the `ISpiderLoader` interface.

The bug seems to be related to the deprecation warning checking and the class loading process. The `load_object` function seems to be missing from the provided code, so it's hard to determine if it's implemented correctly. Additionally, the warning message and the deprecation handling might not be set up properly, leading to potential errors or unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the following changes can be made to the function:
1. Use 'SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS' if it exists in the settings, otherwise fallback to using 'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'.
2. Properly handle the deprecation warning and use the correct stack level to point to the caller location.
3. Implement the `load_object` function if it's not already available to load the class dynamically.
4. Ensure that the class loaded from the settings implements the `ISpiderLoader` interface.
5. Return an instance of the loaded class using `from_settings` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_spider_loader` function:

```python
import warnings
from scrapy.exceptions import ScrapyDeprecationWarning
from scrapy.loader import ISpiderLoader

def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if 'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS' in settings:
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=3
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS', settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'))
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)  # Assuming load_object is implemented correctly
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```

With these changes, the function should handle the deprecation warning, load the correct class, and return an instance of the loaded class.
