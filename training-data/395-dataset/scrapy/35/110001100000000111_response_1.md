The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of the deprecated 'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS' setting.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is trying to access a deprecated setting, 'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS', which is no longer used and has been replaced with 'SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS'.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to use the correct 'SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS' setting and remove the deprecated 'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS' setting.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS'):
        cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS')
    else:
        cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS')
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the 'SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS' setting is present. If it is, we use that setting to get the class path. If not, we fallback to the deprecated 'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS' setting and raise a deprecation warning. Then, we load the object using the class path, verify the class interface, and return the loader instance created from the settings.
