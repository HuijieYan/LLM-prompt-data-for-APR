The error message indicates that the `runner.spider_loader` is not an instance of `CustomSpiderLoader`, as expected. This could be due to the issue within the `_get_spider_loader` function that is not returning the correct loader instance.

The potential error location within the `_get_spider_loader` function is in the line:
```python
return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```
This line is responsible for creating and returning the loader instance, but it seems to have a problem with retrieving the correct loader class from the settings.

The bug occurred because the function was using the deprecated `SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS` option instead of the updated `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS`. This resulted in the incorrect loader class being retrieved from the settings and used to create the loader instance.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to use the `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS` from the settings, as per the deprecation notice.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import warnings

def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS')
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```

With this corrected function, it should correctly use the `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS` from the settings and create the appropriate loader instance.

Additionally, the test case should now pass without any assertion errors.
