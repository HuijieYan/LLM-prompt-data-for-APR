Potential error location:
The potential error location is in the usage of the `load_object()` function which is not defined in the provided code.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the `load_object()` function is not defined in the provided code. This function needs to be defined in order for the code to work properly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define the `load_object()` function within the same file or import it from the appropriate module.
2. If the `load_object()` function is part of a library or another module, ensure that it is properly installed and imported in the code.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import warnings

def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS',
                            settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'))
    # Assuming load_object is imported from the appropriate module
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```
