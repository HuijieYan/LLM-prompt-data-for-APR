The error message indicates that the `runner.spider_loader` is not an instance of `CustomSpiderLoader` as expected. This is likely due to the `_get_spider_loader` function not returning the correct loader class instance.

The potential error location within the `_get_spider_loader` function is the line `return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())`. This line is likely not creating the correct instance of the spider loader.

The bug is occurring because the `from_settings` method is not correctly instantiating the spider loader object. Instead, it should directly call the constructor of the spider loader class and pass the settings to it.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the line `return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())` to `return loader_cls(settings.frozencopy())`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_spider_loader` function:

```python
def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS',
                            settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'))
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls(settings.frozencopy())
```
