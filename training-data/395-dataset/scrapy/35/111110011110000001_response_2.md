The error message indicates that the `runner.spider_loader` is not an instance of `CustomSpiderLoader` as expected, leading to an `AssertionError`.

The potential error location is within the `_get_spider_loader` function, specifically where the `loader_cls` is being loaded and returned.

The bug occurs because the `loader_cls` is being loaded from the settings using the `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS` key, but the `SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS` key is being deprecated and generating a warning. This leads to the incorrect loader class being used, which causes the test case to fail.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to update the code to use the `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS` key exclusively, and remove the usage of the deprecated `SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS` key. This will ensure that the correct loader class is loaded and returned.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected function
def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    loader_cls = load_object(settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS'))
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```

By using the `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS` key exclusively, the correct loader class will be loaded, and the test case should pass without any assertion errors.
