The error occurs in the test_spidermanager_deprecation function, where it's expecting the spider_loader to be an instance of CustomSpiderLoader, but it's actually an instance of scrapy.spiderloader.SpiderLoader.

The issue likely lies in the _get_spider_loader function. The bug seems to be related to the loader_cls.from_settings() call, which is instantiating the wrong SpiderLoader class.

The reason for this bug is likely that the settings are still using the deprecated SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option instead of the new SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS option.

To fix this bug, we need to update the settings to use the new SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS option.

Here's the corrected code for the _get_spider_loader function:

```python
def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning,
            stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS',
                            settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'))
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls(settings)
```

In this corrected code, we changed the last line `return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())` to `return loader_cls(settings)` to instantiate the correct SpiderLoader class based on the settings provided. This should fix the bug and make the test_spidermanager_deprecation function pass.
