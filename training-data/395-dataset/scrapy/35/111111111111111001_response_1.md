The error occurs in the test_spidermanager_deprecation function, where it checks if the spider_loader instance is an instance of CustomSpiderLoader. However, the buggy function is returning an instance of the SpiderLoader class instead of CustomSpiderLoader.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line `cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS', settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'))`. This line is responsible for getting the class path for the loader, and it seems that it's returning the wrong class.

The issue is occurring because the settings are set to use CustomSpiderLoader, but the function is returning an instance of SpiderLoader instead.

To fix this issue, the function needs to be modified to return an instance of CustomSpiderLoader instead of SpiderLoader. This can be achieved by ensuring that the correct class path is retrieved from the settings.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS')
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```
