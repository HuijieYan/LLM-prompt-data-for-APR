Potential error location: The error could be related to the use of deprecated settings 'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS' and the warning being issued.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The function is trying to access the 'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS' setting, issue a warning if it's found, and then use the 'SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS' setting instead. The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where 'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS' is not present in the settings.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if 'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS' is present in the settings, issue a warning if it is, and then use 'SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS'.
2. If 'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS' is not present, simply use 'SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS' setting.

Corrected code:
```python
from scrapy.utils.deprecate import ScrapyDeprecationWarning
from zope.interface.verify import verifyClass
from scrapy.interfaces import ISpiderLoader
from scrapy.utils.misc import load_object

def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
        cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS')
    else:
        cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS')
        
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```
