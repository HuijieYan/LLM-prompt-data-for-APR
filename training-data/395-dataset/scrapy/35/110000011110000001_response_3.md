The test case `test_spidermanager_deprecation` is trying to check if the `runner.spider_loader` is an instance of `CustomSpiderLoader`, but it fails with an AssertionError.

The potential error location within the `_get_spider_loader` function is the line:
`return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())`

The bug occurs because `from_settings` is not a class method of `loader_cls`, hence causing the AssertionError in the test case.

To fix the bug, `from_settings` should be replaced with `loader_cls(settings)`. This will instantiate `loader_cls` with the given `settings` and return the instance.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import warnings

def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS',
                            settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'))
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls(settings)
```
