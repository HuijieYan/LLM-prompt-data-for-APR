Potential Error Location: 

The potential error is occurring at the line `return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())`. The `loader_cls.from_settings` should be called as a method on an instance of `loader_cls`, not on the class itself.

Reasons behind the Bug:

The bug is occurring because the `from_settings` method is being called directly on the `loader_cls` class, rather than on an instance of the class. This is resulting in a TypeError. Additionally, the `cls_path` variable is incorrectly pointing to a custom SpiderLoader class, whereas it should be set to the default Scrapy SpiderLoader class.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:

1. Create an instance of `loader_cls` and call the `from_settings` method on that instance.
2. Set the `cls_path` variable to the default Scrapy SpiderLoader class.

Corrected Code:

```python
from scrapy.utils.misc import load_object
from scrapy.interfaces import ISpiderLoader
from scrapy.exceptions import ScrapyDeprecationWarning
import warnings

def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS', 'scrapy.spiderloader.SpiderLoader')
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    loader_instance = loader_cls()
    return loader_instance.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```

In the corrected code, we have created an instance of `loader_cls` using `loader_cls()`, and then we call the `from_settings` method on that instance. Additionally, we set the `cls_path` variable to the default Scrapy SpiderLoader class.
