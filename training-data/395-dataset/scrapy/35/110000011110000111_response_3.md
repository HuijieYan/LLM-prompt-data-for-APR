The error in the test case is due to the incorrect assertion of the `runner.spider_loader` object. The test is expecting an instance of `CustomSpiderLoader`, but it's getting an instance of `SpiderLoader`.

The bug in the `_get_spider_loader` function is likely related to the use of the deprecated `SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS` setting instead of the new `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS` setting. This is what is causing the incorrect class to be loaded.

To fix this bug:
1. Change the `SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS` setting to `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS` in the `get_spider_loader` function.
2. Update the class instantiation to use the correct class based on the `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS` setting provided in the `settings`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_spider_loader` function:

```python
import warnings
from scrapy.exceptions import ScrapyDeprecationWarning
from scrapy.interfaces import ISpiderLoader
from scrapy.utils.misc import load_object

def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS')
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```

This should resolve the issue and correctly load the specified `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS` based on the settings.
