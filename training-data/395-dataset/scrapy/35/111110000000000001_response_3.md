Potential error location: The potential error location is in the line `return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())`. The issue seems to be with the `from_settings` method being called on `loader_cls`.

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs because the `from_settings` method is being called on `loader_cls`, but it seems that the correct method to use here is `from_settings`. This is likely a typographical error.

Approach for fixing the bug: Replace the `from_settings` method call with `from_settings`.

Corrected code:
```python
def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS',
                            settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'))
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```
