The error message is indicating that the `runner.spider_loader` is an instance of `scrapy.spiderloader.SpiderLoader` instead of the expected instance of `tests.test_crawler.CustomSpiderLoader`. This suggests that the `_get_spider_loader` function is not returning the correct loader instance.

The potential error location is within the `_get_spider_loader` function, specifically in the line `return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())`. This is where the loader instance is being returned based on the settings.

The reason behind this bug is that the function is not properly handling the settings and instantiating the correct loader class.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the correct loader class is instantiated based on the settings provided. We also need to update the test case to reflect the corrected behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_spider_loader` function:

```python
def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS',
                            settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'))
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls(settings)  # Instantiate the loader class with the settings
```

We are now instantiating the `loader_cls` with the `settings`, ensuring that the correct loader class is returned based on the settings provided.

Additionally, the test case needs to be updated to reflect the corrected behavior.
