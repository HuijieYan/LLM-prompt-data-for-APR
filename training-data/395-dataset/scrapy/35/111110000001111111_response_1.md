The error occurs because the function is trying to load the SpiderLoader class from the settings, but it's using the deprecated SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option instead of the new SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS. Additionally, the function is calling a method from the loader_cls without instantiating it, which may cause issues.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to use the new SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS option and instantiate the loader_cls before calling the from_settings method.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import warnings
from zope.interface.verify import verifyClass
from scrapy.interfaces import ISpiderLoader
from scrapy.utils.misc import load_object

def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning,
            stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS')
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls(settings)
```

In the corrected code:
- We check for the presence of SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS in the settings instead of SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS.
- We use the load_object function to load the loader_cls based on the SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS from the settings.
- We verify the class with the ISpiderLoader interface.
- Finally, we instantiate the loader_cls with the settings before returning it.

This should fix the bug and ensure that the SpiderLoader class is loaded correctly from the settings.
