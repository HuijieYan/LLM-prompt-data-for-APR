The error occurs in the `test_spidermanager_deprecation` test function, where it asserts that `runner.spider_loader` is an instance of `CustomSpiderLoader`, but it fails and raises an AssertionError.

The potential error lies in the `_get_spider_loader` function, specifically in the line `loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())`. It seems that the function is not returning an instance of `CustomSpiderLoader` as expected.

The bug occurs because the `_get_spider_loader` function is not correctly using the settings to load the spider loader class. The `SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS` option is being deprecated, and it should be using `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS` instead. Additionally, the function should return an instance of `SpiderLoader` from the correct class path based on the settings.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to use the correct class path and return an instance of `SpiderLoader` as expected.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_spider_loader` function:

```python
from scrapy.utils.misc import load_object
from scrapy.interfaces import ISpiderLoader
from zope.interface.verify import verifyClass
from scrapy.settings import Settings

def _get_spider_loader(settings: Settings) -> ISpiderLoader:
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS',
                            settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'))
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls.from_settings(settings)
```

With this correction, the `_get_spider_loader` function should now correctly use the settings to load the spider loader class and return an instance of `SpiderLoader` based on the provided class path.
