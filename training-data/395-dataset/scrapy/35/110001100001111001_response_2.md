The bug in the given function `_get_spider_loader` is that it is not correctly setting the `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS` in the `settings` variable. 

The bug occurs because the function is using `settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS')` instead of `settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS')` to get the class path for the loader. This results in the deprecated warning being raised and the wrong class being loaded.

To fix the bug, we need to update the code to use `settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS')` to get the class path for the loader.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_spider_loader` function:

```python
from scrapy.utils.misc import load_object
from zope.interface.verify import verifyClass
from scrapy.interfaces import ISpiderLoader
from scrapy.exceptions import ScrapyDeprecationWarning

def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS'):
        cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS')
    elif settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
        cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS')
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly set the `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS` from the settings and return the expected SpiderLoader instance.
