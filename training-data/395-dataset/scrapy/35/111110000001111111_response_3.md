The potential error in the function is with the `cls_path` variable, which is being set to either `settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS')` or `settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS')`. 

The bug occurred because the function is using the deprecated `SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS` option, and the warning message is being triggered when this option is found in the settings.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to use the `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS` option instead of the deprecated `SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS` option. Additionally, we should remove the warning message related to the deprecated option.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import warnings

def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS')
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```

In this corrected code:
- The `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS` option is used to set the `cls_path` variable.
- The deprecated `SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS` option and the related warning message have been removed.
