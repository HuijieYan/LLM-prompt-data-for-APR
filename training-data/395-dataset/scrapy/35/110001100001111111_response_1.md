The bug is occurring in the `_get_spider_loader` function. The problem is with the `cls_path` variable, which is being set based on the value of `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS` or `SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS` from the settings. It seems that the value of `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS` or `SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS` is set to `'tests.test_crawler.CustomSpiderLoader'` instead of `'scrapy.spiderloader.SpiderLoader'`.

Given the information from the issue description, it seems like the `SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS` is deprecated and should be replaced with `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS`.

To fix the bug, we need to update the settings to have the correct value for `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS`. Additionally, we need to ensure that the correct class is loaded and returned by the function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected function
def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS', 'scrapy.spiderloader.SpiderLoader')
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```

In the corrected code, we are directly using `settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS', 'scrapy.spiderloader.SpiderLoader')` to get the correct class path, ensuring that it defaults to `scrapy.spiderloader.SpiderLoader` if not explicitly set in the settings. This should resolve the bug and return the expected class and method instances.
