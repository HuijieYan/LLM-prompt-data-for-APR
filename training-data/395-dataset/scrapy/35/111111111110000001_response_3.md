The error message is indicating an AssertionError because the `runner.spider_loader` is not an instance of `CustomSpiderLoader` as expected. This suggests that the `_get_spider_loader` function is not returning the correct loader instance.

The potential error location within the `_get_spider_loader` function is the line:
```python
return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```
This is where the loader instance is being returned.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `loader_cls` instance returned from `load_object(cls_path)` may not be an instance of `CustomSpiderLoader`. Instead, it may be an instance of `SpiderLoader`.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the correct loader class is being returned and used.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from scrapy.spiderloader import SpiderLoader

def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS',
                            settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'))
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)

    if isinstance(loader_cls, SpiderLoader):
        return loader_cls(settings)
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid SpiderLoader class")

```

In the corrected code, we explicitly check if the `loader_cls` is an instance of `SpiderLoader`. If it is, we create an instance of the loader using the provided settings. Otherwise, we raise a ValueError indicating that the SpiderLoader class is invalid. This ensures that the correct loader class is being used and returned.
