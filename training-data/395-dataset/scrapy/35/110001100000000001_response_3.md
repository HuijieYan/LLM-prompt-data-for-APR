The potential error in the given function is that it is trying to access a key 'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS' directly from the settings dictionary without any error handling, which could result in a KeyError if the key does not exist. Additionally, the function is trying to use the deprecated 'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS' option without checking if it's actually present in the settings.

To fix this, we can implement error handling to check if the key 'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS' exists and use a default value if it doesn't. We also need to update the warning message to specify the correct option 'SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS'.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_35/scrapy/crawler.py

import warnings

def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    spider_loader_class = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS', 'default_loader_class')
    if 'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS' in settings:
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=DeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
        spider_loader_class = settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS')

    loader_cls = load_object(spider_loader_class)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```

In the corrected code, we first check if 'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS' is present in the settings and issue a warning. Then we use the 'SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS' as the default value for the variable `spider_loader_class`. Finally, we use the `spider_loader_class` to load the object and return the result.

This should address the issue with accessing the key directly and provide a default value if 'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS' is not present in the settings.
