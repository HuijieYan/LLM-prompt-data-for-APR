The error is likely occurring at the line `loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())` in the provided function. This is where the `from_settings` method is being called on the `loader_cls` object.

The error occurs because the `from_settings` method is not found in the `CustomSpiderLoader` class. Instead, it should be found in the `SpiderLoader` class as specified in the expected output.

To fix this bug, the `cls_path` variable needs to be updated to point to the `SpiderLoader` class instead of the `CustomSpiderLoader` class. This will ensure that the correct class with the `from_settings` method is used.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
import warnings
from scrapy.utils.misc import load_object
from scrapy.interfaces import ISpiderLoader
from scrapy.settings import Settings

def _get_spider_loader(settings: Settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS', 'scrapy.spiderloader.SpiderLoader')
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```

In this corrected code, the `cls_path` variable is updated to point to the `SpiderLoader` class, and the `from_settings` method should now be accessible in the `loader_cls` class, as expected.
