# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
[MRG+1] rename SpiderManager to SpiderLoader
```

## The associated detailed issue description
```text
As discussed in #873.

spidermanager.SpiderManager is renamed to spiderloader.SpiderLoader;
interfaces.ISpiderManager is renamed to interfaces.ISpiderLoader;
SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS is renamed to SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS;
interface validation is added to deprecated Crawler._spider property;
docstrings are added to SpiderLoader and its methods;
def SpiderManagerWithWrongInterface(object) is changed to class SpiderLoaderWithWrongInterface(object);
unfortunately I had to rename self.spiderman to self.spider_loader in tests;
CrawlerRunner.spiders is renamed to CrawlerRunner.spider_loader;
'spiders' is removed from telnet.
What do you think about renaming CrawlerRunner.spiders to CrawlerRunner.spiderloader or CrawlerRunner.spider_loader? I'd remove it altogether, but that needs another discussion :)
```
