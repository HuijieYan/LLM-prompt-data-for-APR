The error message indicates that the `runner.spider_loader` is not an instance of `CustomSpiderLoader` as expected. This means that the function `_get_spider_loader` is not returning the correct loader instance.

The potential error location in the `_get_spider_loader` function seems to be the line where the `loader_cls` is instantiated. It's either not resolving to the correct class or not instantiating it properly.

The bug occurs because the function is not correctly resolving the class path from the settings and instantiating the correct loader class.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the function resolves the class path correctly from the settings and instantiates the class properly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import warnings

def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS', settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'))
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```

In this corrected code, we ensure that the `cls_path` is resolved from the settings correctly, and the `loader_cls` is instantiated using the resolved class path. This should resolve the issue with the test case failing due to the incorrect instance of the loader class.
