Potential error location: The problematic line is likely `loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)`.

Reason for the bug: The bug is likely due to the incorrect cls_path value being retrieved from the settings.

Approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Ensure that the correct value for 'SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS' is retrieved from the settings.
2. Use the correct class path to instantiate the loader_cls.

```python
# Corrected function
import warnings
from scrapy.utils.misc import load_object
from scrapy.interfaces import ISpiderLoader
from scrapy.exceptions import ScrapyDeprecationWarning

def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS', 'scrapy.spiderloader.SpiderLoader')
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```
