Potential error location: 
The potential error is in the line `return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())`. The issue seems to be that `loader_cls` does not have a `from_settings` method.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: 
The bug occurs because the `loader_cls` object does not have a `from_settings` method, which results in a AttributeError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
Instead of calling a `from_settings` method on the `loader_cls` object, we should create a new SpiderLoader instance and pass the settings to it.

Corrected code:
```python
from scrapy.utils.misc import load_object
from scrapy.interfaces import ISpiderLoader
from scrapy.settings import Settings
from scrapy.spiderloader import SpiderLoader

def _get_spider_loader(settings:Settings) -> SpiderLoader:
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS',
                            settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'))
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return SpiderLoader.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```
