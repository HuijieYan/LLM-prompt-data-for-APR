Potential Error Location: The error is likely occurring in the line that retrieves the value for `cls_path`. This line is responsible for getting the value for `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS` or falling back to `SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS` if the former is not present.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug: The bug might be caused by the incorrect value retrieved for `cls_path`. The incorrect value might lead to the creation of an instance of the wrong class or method.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: We need to ensure that the correct value is retrieved for `cls_path` by directly accessing the `SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS` setting and then returning an instance of the correct class. We also need to remove the deprecated `SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS` check and warning. 

# Corrected Code
```python
import deprecation

def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS', 'scrapy.spiderloader.SpiderLoader')
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls.from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```
