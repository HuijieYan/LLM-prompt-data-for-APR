The potential error location in the code is the usage of `from_settings` at the end of the function. This method does not exist for `loader_cls`, and it seems like the intention was to call `from_settings` on the instance of the loader class, not on the class itself.

The error occurs because the method `from_settings` is being called on the class `loader_cls` instead of an instance of that class. As a result, the method `from_settings` does not exist for the class, leading to an AttributeError.

To fix this bug, we need to create an instance of the `loader_cls` class and then call the `from_settings` method on that instance.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_spider_loader(settings):
    """ Get SpiderLoader instance from settings """
    if settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'):
        warnings.warn(
            'SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS option is deprecated. '
            'Please use SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS.',
            category=ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2
        )
    cls_path = settings.get('SPIDER_LOADER_CLASS',
                            settings.get('SPIDER_MANAGER_CLASS'))
    loader_cls = load_object(cls_path)
    verifyClass(ISpiderLoader, loader_cls)
    return loader_cls().from_settings(settings.frozencopy())
```

In the corrected code, we instantiate the `loader_cls` class with `loader_cls()` and then call the `from_settings` method on that instance.
