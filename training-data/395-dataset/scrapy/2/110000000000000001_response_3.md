The potential error in the provided code is the incorrect usage of the `__setitem__` method. It seems like this code is meant to be a method within a class, as it refers to `self`, but it is written as a standalone function.

The error is occurring because the `__setitem__` method is not properly defined within a class and is trying to use `self` to access the instance and perform operations on it.

To fix this, we need to define the `__setitem__` method within a class and correctly use `self` to access the instance attributes and methods.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class LocalCache:
    def __init__(self, limit):
        self.limit = limit
        self.cache = {}

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        while len(self.cache) >= self.limit:
            self.cache.popitem(last=False)
        self.cache[key] = value
```

In the corrected code, the `__setitem__` method is defined within the `LocalCache` class. It properly uses `self.cache` to access the cache dictionary and `self.limit` to access the limit. Then it adds the key-value pair to the cache after removing any excess items based on the limit.
