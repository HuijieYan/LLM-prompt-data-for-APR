Potential error location: 
The error is likely occurring in the while loop condition, where the length of the 'self' object is being checked.

Reasons behind the bug:
1. The code references 'self' as if it's a dictionary, but it's not clear from the given function what 'self' is.
2. The 'limit' variable is not defined in the function, so it's unclear what value is being used for comparison.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define 'self' as a dictionary or specify the type of 'self' to ensure it has a valid length property.
2. Define the 'limit' variable or pass it as an argument to the function.

Corrected code:
```python
# Corrected function
def __setitem__(self, key, value, limit):
    while len(self) >= limit:
        self.popitem(last=False)
    super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```
