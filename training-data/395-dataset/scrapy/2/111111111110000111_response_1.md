The error occurs when the test function attempts to set an item in the LocalCache. The error message indicates that there is a TypeError because the ">= self.limit" comparison is not supported between an integer and NoneType.

The potential error location within the __setitem__ function is the following line:
```python
while len(self) >= self.limit:
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the "self.limit" variable is not defined within the LocalCache class. As a result, it defaults to None, and the comparison "len(self) >= self.limit" between an integer and NoneType raises a TypeError.

To fix this bug, the "self.limit" variable needs to be defined within the LocalCache class, specifying the maximum number of items the cache can hold.

The corrected code for the problematic function __setitem__ is as follows:

```python
class LocalCache(collections.OrderedDict):
    """
    Dictionary with a finite number of keys.
    
    Older items expires first.
    """

    # Establishing the limit for the cache
    def __init__(self, limit=None, *args, **kw):
        if limit is not None:
            self.limit = limit
        super().__init__(*args, **kw)

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        # Check if the limit is defined, and if not, set a default limit
        if not hasattr(self, 'limit'):
            self.limit = 100  # default limit of 100 items

        while len(self) >= self.limit:
            self.popitem(last=False)
        super().__setitem__(key, value)
```
In this corrected code:
- The initialization of the LocalCache class includes an optional "limit" parameter, which sets the maximum number of items the cache can hold.
- If the "limit" is not provided, a default limit of 100 items is set.
- The __setitem__ function now checks if the "limit" attribute is defined and sets a default limit if it is not present.
- The comparison "len(self) >= self.limit" can now be safely performed without raising a TypeError.
