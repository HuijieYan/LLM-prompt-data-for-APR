Potential Error Location: The while loop inside the __setitem__ function does not have a reference to self.limit, which is not defined in the given code.

Reasons behind the bug: The while loop is trying to compare the length of self with self.limit, but self.limit is not defined anywhere in the given code. This will result in a NameError.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define self.limit in the class as a class variable.
2. Pass self.limit as a parameter to the constructor of the class.

Corrected code:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class LocalCache(collections.OrderedDict):
    """
    Dictionary with a finite number of keys.
    
    Older items expires first.
    """

    # Initialize the class with a limit
    def __init__(self, limit):
        super().__init__()
        self.limit = limit

    # Override the __setitem__ function
    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        while len(self) >= self.limit:
            self.popitem(last=False)
        super().__setitem__(key, value)
```
