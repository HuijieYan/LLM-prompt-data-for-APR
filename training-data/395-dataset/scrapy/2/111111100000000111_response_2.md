The error in the given code is that the `__setitem__` method is defined three times within the `LocalCache` class, and the last one is an invalid override of the previous ones.

The reason for the bug is that the `__setitem__` method is being defined multiple times with the same signature, which is not allowed in Python. Additionally, the logic in the last `__setitem__` method is incorrect as it does not handle the possibility of `key` already existing in the dictionary.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the extra definitions of the `__setitem__` method and correct the logic in the remaining `__setitem__` method to handle the case where `key` already exists in the dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the `__setitem__` method:

```python
def __setitem__(self, key, value):
    if key in self:
        del self[key]  # Remove the existing key, so it can be re-added, moving it to the end
    while len(self) >= self.limit:
        self.popitem(last=False)
    super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```

With this correction, the `__setitem__` method first checks if the `key` already exists in the dictionary. If it does, it removes the existing key-value pair before adding the new one. Then, it proceeds to the original logic of ensuring the length of the dictionary does not exceed the limit, and finally adding the new key-value pair to the dictionary.
