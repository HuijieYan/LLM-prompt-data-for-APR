Potential error location: The while loop condition `while len(self) >= self.limit` is causing the TypeError since `self.limit` is not defined in the provided code.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the code is trying to compare the length of `self` (which is a dictionary) with `self.limit`, but `self.limit` is not defined.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define `self.limit` within the `LocalCache` class or as a part of the constructor to ensure that it is initialized with a valid value.
2. Use the `len` function with a specific value or condition as the loop termination condition.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected function with a defined limit
class LocalCache(dict):
    def __init__(self, limit=None):
        super().__init__()
        self.limit = limit

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        if self.limit is None or len(self) >= self.limit:
            self.popitem(last=False)
        super().__setitem__(key, value)

# test function remains unchanged
def test_cache_without_limit(self):
        max = 10**4
        cache = LocalCache()
        for x in range(max):
            cache[str(x)] = x
        self.assertEqual(len(cache), max)
        for x in range(max):
            self.assertIn(str(x), cache)
            self.assertEqual(cache[str(x)], x)
```
