1. The test case is trying to populate a LocalCache object with keys and values using a for loop. The error message indicates that there is a TypeError occurring within the __setitem__ method of the LocalCache class.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the while loop where the length of the LocalCache object is compared to its limit property.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code is trying to compare the length of the LocalCache object with its limit property, but the limit property is not defined. This results in a TypeError because 'int' (length of the cache) and 'NoneType' (limit property) cannot be compared using the ">=" operator.

4. To fix the bug, the code needs to check if the limit property is defined before comparing it with the length of the LocalCache object. If the limit property is not defined, the code should not attempt to limit the cache size.

5. Below is the corrected code for the __setitem__ method of the LocalCache class:

```python
def __setitem__(self, key, value):
    if hasattr(self, 'limit') and self.limit is not None:  # Check if limit is defined
        while len(self) >= self.limit:
            self.popitem(last=False)
    super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```
