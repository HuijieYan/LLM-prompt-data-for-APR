Potential Error Location: The while loop inside the __setitem__ function where it checks the length of the LocalCache and pops items if it exceeds the limit.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The while loop is not necessary as the `collections.OrderedDict` already maintains the order of insertion and has a finite capacity. 

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Remove the unnecessary while loop and directly call `super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)`.

Corrected code:
```python
def __setitem__(self, key, value):
    if len(self) >= self.limit:
        self.popitem(last=False)
    super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```
