Potential error location: The conditional statement "while len(self) >= self.limit" is incorrect.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The while loop checks if the length of the container is greater than or equal to the limit, and if so, it pops an item. However, it should be checking if the length is greater than the limit, as popping an item should only occur when the length exceeds the limit.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Change the while loop condition to "while len(self) > self.limit", and also add a check to remove the oldest item if the length equals the limit.

Corrected code:
```python
def __setitem__(self, key, value):
    if len(self) >= self.limit:
        self.popitem(last=False)
    super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```
