The error message indicates that there is an issue with the comparison operation in the `__setitem__` function of the `LocalCache` class. The error message specifically mentions that the comparison of the length of the cache with its limit is causing a `TypeError` due to comparing 'int' with 'NoneType'.

The potential error location is within the comparison operation in the while loop:

```python
while len(self) >= self.limit:
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `self.limit` attribute is not defined within the `LocalCache` class, resulting in a `NoneType` value. This makes the comparison with the length of the cache (`len(self)`) invalid, hence resulting in a `TypeError`.

To fix the bug, the `limit` attribute needs to be defined within the `LocalCache` class to ensure that the comparison in the while loop is valid.

Corrected code for the `__setitem__` function:

```python
def __setitem__(self, key, value):
    if not hasattr(self, 'limit') or self.limit is None:  # Check if 'limit' attribute is defined and not None
        super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)  # If 'limit' is not defined or None, set the item directly
    else:
        while len(self) >= self.limit:  # Check if the length of the cache exceeds the limit
            self.popitem(last=False)  # If it exceeds, remove the oldest item
        super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)  # Set the new item
```

In this corrected code, we first check if the `limit` attribute is defined and not `None`. If it is not defined or `None`, we directly set the item without comparing the length of the cache. If the `limit` is defined, we then perform the comparison and possibly remove the oldest item from the cache.
