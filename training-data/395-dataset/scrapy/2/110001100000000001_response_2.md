The potential error in the provided function is that the while loop condition should be checking for greater than rather than greater than or equal to. The current condition does not allow the function to add elements to the cache if the limit is reached, as the loop will continue to run even when the length is at the limit.

This bug occurs because the condition in the while loop is not properly checking for the length of the cache compared to the limit.

To fix the bug, we need to change the condition in the while loop to check for `len(self) > self.limit` instead of `len(self) >= self.limit`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __setitem__(self, key, value):
    while len(self) > self.limit:
        self.popitem(last=False)
    super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```
