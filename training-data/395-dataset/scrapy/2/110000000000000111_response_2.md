Potential error: The while loop condition to check if the length of the cache is greater than or equal to the limit is incorrect.

Reason for the bug: The condition is using the wrong comparison operator. It should be checking if the length is greater than the limit, not greater than or equal to the limit.

Approach for fixing the bug: Modify the while loop condition to check if the length of the cache is greater than the limit.

Corrected code:

```python
def __setitem__(self, key, value):
    while len(self) > self.limit:
        self.popitem(last=False)
    super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```
