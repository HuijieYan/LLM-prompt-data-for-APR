Potential Error:
The while loop that checks if the length of the LocalCache is greater than or equal to the limit is incorrect. The condition should be len(self) >= self.max_limit, where max_limit is the maximum number of keys allowed in the LocalCache.

Reason behind the Bug:
The current while loop condition is just len(self) >= self.limit, which does not take into account the maximum limit set for the LocalCache. This will lead to an infinite loop if the limit is not properly checked.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
Change the while loop condition to check against the max_limit instead of self.limit, and make sure to initialize the max_limit attribute for the LocalCache class.

Corrected Code:
```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class LocalCache(collections.OrderedDict):
    """
    Dictionary with a finite number of keys.
    
    Older items expires first.
    """

    def __init__(self, max_limit):
        super().__init__()
        self.max_limit = max_limit

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        while len(self) >= self.max_limit:
            self.popitem(last=False)
        super().__setitem__(key, value)
```
