The potential error in the code is the redefinition of the `__setitem__` method multiple times without any actual implementation inside the LocalCache class.

The reason behind the bug is that the `__setitem__` method is being redefined without any implementation, leading to unexpected behavior when calling the method.

To fix the bug, the redundant redefinitions of the `__setitem__` method should be removed and the actual implementation should be added.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs_non_pandas/repos/scrapy_2/scrapy/utils/datatypes.py

import collections

class LocalCache(collections.OrderedDict):
    """
    Dictionary with a finite number of keys.
    
    Older items expires first.
    """

    def __init__(self, limit):
        super(LocalCache, self).__init__()
        self.limit = limit

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        while len(self) >= self.limit:
            self.popitem(last=False)
        super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```

In this corrected code, the `__setitem__` method is properly implemented within the LocalCache class, and the redundant redefinitions have been removed.
