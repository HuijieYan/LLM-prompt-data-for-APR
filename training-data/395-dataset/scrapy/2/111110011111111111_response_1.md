1. The test case is trying to create a `LocalCache` object and populate it with values using a loop. It then checks if the length of the cache is equal to the maximum value and whether each value is present in the cache.

2. The potential error location is the comparison `while len(self) >= self.limit` within the `__setitem__` function in the `LocalCache` class.

3. The error message indicates that there is an issue with comparing the length of the cache with the `limit` attribute, which results in a `TypeError`. This suggests that the `limit` attribute is not defined, or its value is `None`, causing the comparison to fail.

4. To fix the bug, we need to properly define the `limit` attribute in the `LocalCache` class and use it for comparison within the `__setitem__` function.

5. The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
import collections

# class declaration containing the buggy function
class LocalCache(collections.OrderedDict):
    """
    Dictionary with a finite number of keys.
    
    Older items expires first.
    """

    def __init__(self, limit=None, *args, **kwargs):
        self.limit = limit
        super(LocalCache, self).__init__(*args, **kwargs)

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        if self.limit is not None and len(self) >= self.limit:
            self.popitem(last=False)
        super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```

In this corrected code, the `__init__` method is defined to initialize the `limit` attribute. Then, within the `__setitem__` method, we check if the `limit` attribute is not `None` before comparing the length of the cache with the limit. If the limit is reached, we pop an item from the cache before setting the new item. This ensures that the limit is properly enforced.
