Potential Error Location: 
The error seems to occur at the line `while len(self) >= self.limit` in the `__setitem__` method of the `LocalCache` class.

Reason for the Bug: 
The error message indicates that there is a TypeError because the comparison `>=` is not supported between an instance of 'int' and 'NoneType'. This suggests that `self.limit` is not defined, leading to the comparison between the length of the cache and `None`.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Define a `limit` attribute for the `LocalCache` class and initialize it in the class constructor.
2. Use a default limit value to be used when a specific limit is not provided during the initialization of the `LocalCache` instance.

Corrected Code:
```python
class LocalCache(collections.OrderedDict):
    """
    Dictionary with a finite number of keys.
    
    Older items expires first.
    """

    def __init__(self, limit=None, *args, **kwargs):
        self.limit = limit or float('inf')
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        while len(self) >= self.limit:
            self.popitem(last=False)
        super().__setitem__(key, value)
```
