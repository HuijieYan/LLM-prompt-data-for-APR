The error occurs when the __setitem__ function in the LocalCache class tries to compare the length of the cache with a limit that has not been defined, resulting in a comparison between an integer and a NoneType.

To fix this bug, we need to define a limit for the cache and modify the comparison in the __setitem__ function to use the limit instead of comparing the length of the cache directly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def __setitem__(self, key, value):
    if self.limit is not None and len(self) >= self.limit:
        self.popitem(last=False)
    super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```

By adding a check for self.limit not being None and fixing the comparison in the if statement, we ensure that the __setitem__ function works correctly with a defined limit for the cache.
