Potential error location: The error likely occurs in the while loop condition, where it should be checking if the length of `self` is greater than the `limit` instead of checking if it is greater than or equal to the `limit`.

Reason for bug: The while loop condition is checking for the wrong condition, leading to the loop not executing as expected. This could potentially cause the cache to grow larger than the defined limit.

Approach for fixing the bug: Change the while loop condition to check if the length of the `self` is greater than the `limit`.

Corrected code:

```python
def __setitem__(self, key, value):
    while len(self) > self.limit:
        self.popitem(last=False)
    super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```
