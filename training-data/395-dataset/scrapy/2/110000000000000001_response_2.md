Potential Error Location: The problematic part of the code seems to be the while loop condition `while len(self) >= self.limit`.

Reason for the Bug: The while loop condition is using the comparison operator `>=` which is causing the loop to continue running even when the length is equal to the limit.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use the comparison operator `>` instead of `>=` to ensure that the loop stops when the length exceeds the limit.
2. Additionally, add a check to handle the case when the limit is 0 to avoid an infinite loop.

Corrected Code:
```python
def __setitem__(self, key, value):
    if self.limit > 0:
        while len(self) > self.limit:
            self.popitem(last=False)
        super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```
