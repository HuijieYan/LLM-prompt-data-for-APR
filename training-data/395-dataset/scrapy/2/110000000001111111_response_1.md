Potential error location: The error is occurring in the while loop condition, where the length of 'self' is compared with 'self.limit'. This might be a custom implementation of a cache or dictionary-like class.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because 'self' is being compared to 'self.limit', which is not a valid comparison.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We can use the 'if' statement instead of 'while' loop, and change the condition to check if the length of 'self' is greater than or equal to 'self.limit'. The 'while' loop was causing the code to get stuck as it was continuously checking the same condition.

Corrected code:

```python
# corrected function
def __setitem__(self, key, value):
    if len(self) >= self.limit:
        self.popitem(last=False)
    super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```
