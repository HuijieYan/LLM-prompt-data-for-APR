The error message indicates that there is a TypeError because the comparison operation is being performed between an integer and NoneType. This suggests that the 'self.limit' is not initialized within the LocalCache class, causing it to have a value of None.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `while len(self) >= self.limit:` where self.limit is being compared without being initialized.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the self.limit is not initialized. As a result, when trying to compare the length of the 'self' object with self.limit, it throws a TypeError due to the comparison between an integer and NoneType.

To fix the bug, you need to initialize the self.limit attribute within the LocalCache class. This can be done by adding a limit parameter to the __init__ method of the LocalCache class and setting it as an attribute of the class.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class LocalCache:
    def __init__(self, limit=None):
        self.limit = limit
        # ... other initialization code ...

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        if self.limit is not None:
            while len(self) >= self.limit:
                self.popitem(last=False)
        super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```

In this corrected code, the __init__ method takes a 'limit' parameter which can be used to set the limit for the cache. Inside the __setitem__ method, it first checks if the limit is not None, and then performs the comparison with the length of the 'self' object. If the limit is None (i.e., not set), then the comparison and the while loop are skipped.
