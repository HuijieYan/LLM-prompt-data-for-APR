The potential error in the __setitem__ function is that it does not initialize the 'limit' attribute. This could lead to an AttributeError when trying to compare the length of the LocalCache to the 'limit' attribute.

To fix this bug, the 'limit' attribute needs to be initialized either in the __init__ method or directly in the class body.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
import collections

class LocalCache(collections.OrderedDict):
    """
    Dictionary with a finite number of keys.
    
    Older items expires first.
    """

    # Initialize the limit attribute
    def __init__(self, limit, *args, **kwds):
        super(LocalCache, self).__init__(*args, **kwds)
        self.limit = limit

    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        while len(self) >= self.limit:
            self.popitem(last=False)
        super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```
