Potential error location: The while loop condition `while len(self) >= self.limit` may cause an infinite loop if `self.limit` is not initialized properly or if the length of `self` never decreases.

Reason for the bug: The bug occurs because the while loop condition is not evaluated correctly, and it may lead to an infinite loop if the condition is never false.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if `self.limit` is initialized properly and if it is being updated when necessary.
2. Add a check to ensure that the length of `self` actually decreases when items are removed, so that the while loop can terminate.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def __setitem__(self, key, value):
    while len(self) > 0 and len(self) >= self.limit:
        self.popitem(last=False)
    super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```
