Potential error location: The while loop is not functional because it doesn't have a condition to exit the loop. It will keep running indefinitely since the condition will always be true (len(self) will always be greater than or equal to self.limit).

Reasons behind the bug: The while loop doesn't have a condition to break out of the loop, leading to an infinite loop and potential memory issues.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Add a condition to the while loop to check if the length of the cache is greater than the limit. If it's not, then break out of the loop.

Corrected code:

```python
def __setitem__(self, key, value):
    if len(self) >= self.limit:
        self.popitem(last=False)
    super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```
