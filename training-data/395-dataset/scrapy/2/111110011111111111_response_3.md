Potential Error:
The error is likely occurring in the while loop within the __setitem__ function. The error message suggests that there is an issue with comparing the length of the cache to the 'limit' attribute.

Reason for the Bug:
The current implementation is attempting to compare the length of the cache to a 'limit' attribute, but the 'limit' attribute is not defined within the LocalCache class. This causes the comparison to fail and results in a TypeError.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Define a 'limit' attribute within the LocalCache class and initialize it to the desired maximum number of keys.
2. Use the 'max' variable from the test function as the limit for the cache.

Corrected Code:
```python
class LocalCache(collections.OrderedDict):
    """
    Dictionary with a finite number of keys.

    Older items expires first.
    """

    def __init__(self, limit=None, *args, **kwargs):
        self.limit = limit
        super().__init__(*args, **kwargs)

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        if self.limit is not None:
            while len(self) >= self.limit:
                self.popitem(last=False)
        super().__setitem__(key, value)
```
