The potential error location within the problematic function is the while loop condition: `while len(self) >= self.limit`. The error message indicates that there is a TypeError related to the comparison between the length of `self` and the `self.limit`, which implies that `self.limit` is likely not initialized properly.

The bug occurred because the `self.limit` attribute is not initialized or set anywhere in the provided code, causing it to be `NoneType` by default. This leads to a comparison between an integer and a `NoneType`, resulting in a `TypeError`.

To fix the bug, we need to first initialize and set the `self.limit` attribute. Then, we can modify the while loop condition to compare the length of `self` with the `self.limit`.

Here's the corrected function/method:

```python
def __setitem__(self, key, value):
    if not hasattr(self, 'limit'):
        setattr(self, 'limit', 100)  # Set the default limit to 100, you can change this value as per requirement
    while len(self) >= self.limit:
        self.popitem(last=False)
    super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```

In this corrected code, we first check if the `self.limit` attribute exists. If it doesn't, we set a default limit of 100. Then, we use the `self.limit` attribute in the while loop condition to compare the length of the cache with the limit.
