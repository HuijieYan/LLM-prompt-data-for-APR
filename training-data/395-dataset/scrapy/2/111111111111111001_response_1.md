The error message indicates that there is a TypeError occurring at the line `while len(self) >= self.limit:` in the `__setitem__` method of the LocalCache class. The error is due to the comparison between the length of the LocalCache instance (`len(self)`) and `self.limit`, where `self.limit` is not defined.

The potential error location is within the `while` loop in the `__setitem__` method of the LocalCache class, where the comparison with `self.limit` is causing the TypeError.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `self.limit` attribute is not defined in the LocalCache class, but it is being used in the `__setitem__` method.

To fix the bug, the `limit` attribute needs to be defined in the LocalCache class, and an appropriate value needs to be set for it.

```python
class LocalCache(collections.OrderedDict):
    """
    Dictionary with a finite number of keys.
    
    Older items expires first.
    """

    def __init__(self, limit=1000):
        super().__init__()
        self.limit = limit

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        while len(self) >= self.limit:
            self.popitem(last=False)
        super().__setitem__(key, value)
```

In the corrected code, a default value of 1000 is set for the `limit` attribute in the `__init__` method of the LocalCache class. Then, in the `__setitem__` method, the comparison with `self.limit` is valid as it is now defined. This should resolve the TypeError issue.
