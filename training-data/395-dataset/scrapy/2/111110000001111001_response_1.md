Potential Error Location: The while loop is not properly handling the case where the cache limit is exceeded.

Reason for the Bug: The while loop condition is checking if the length of the cache is greater than or equal to the limit before attempting to add a new item. However, the new item has already been added by the time the while loop condition is checked, resulting in the cache size exceeding the limit.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: The while loop condition needs to be adjusted to check if the length of the cache is greater than the limit after adding the new item.

Corrected Code:
```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class LocalCache(collections.OrderedDict):
    """
    Dictionary with a finite number of keys.
    
    Older items expires first.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # corrected function
    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
        while len(self) > self.limit:
            self.popitem(last=False)
```
