Potential Error and Explanation:
The potential error lies in the use of the `super()` function. The `super()` function is used to call a method of the base class, but in this case, it is not being used correctly. The `super()` function should be used inside a class definition, but here it is being used outside of any class definition. Additionally, the method `__setitem__` should be a part of a class, and it seems like this function is intended to be a part of a class, but is not defined within a class.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
1. Define the `LocalCache` class with the `__setitem__` method within it.
2. Use the `super()` function inside the `__setitem__` method to call the same method from the base class.

Corrected Code:
```python
class LocalCache(dict):
    def __init__(self, limit):
        self.limit = limit
        super().__init__()

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        while len(self) >= self.limit:
            self.popitem(last=False)
        super().__setitem__(key, value)
```
