Potential error location: The while loop that checks if the length of the self is greater than or equal to self.limit.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The while loop condition needs to be greater than, not greater than or equal to. If the length is equal to the limit, the code will still try to remove an item from the cache, which is unnecessary.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Change the while loop condition to check if the length is greater than the limit, not greater than or equal to.

Corrected code:

```python
def __setitem__(self, key, value):
    while len(self) > self.limit:
        self.popitem(last=False)
    super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```
