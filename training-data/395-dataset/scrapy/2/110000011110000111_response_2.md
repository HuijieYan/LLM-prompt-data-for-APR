Potential error location: The error seems to be occurring in the while loop condition where the length of the LocalCache object is compared to the 'limit' attribute, which is not defined in the code provided. This is causing a TypeError.

Reasons for the occurrence of the bug: The 'limit' attribute is not defined in the LocalCache class, and the while loop is trying to compare the length of the LocalCache with an undefined 'limit', causing a TypeError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define a 'limit' attribute in the LocalCache class and use it as the comparison value in the while loop.
2. Alternatively, if the intention is to not have a limit, remove the while loop and directly set the key-value pair in the LocalCache object.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
# Corrected __setitem__ method
def __setitem__(self, key, value):
    if hasattr(self, 'limit') and self.limit is not None:
        while len(self) >= self.limit:
            self.popitem(last=False)
    super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```

In the corrected code, we check if the 'limit' attribute is defined and not None before entering the while loop. If 'limit' is not defined or None, the while loop is skipped, allowing the key-value pair to be set directly. This accounts for both cases where the LocalCache has a limit and where it doesn't.
