The error message is indicating a TypeError when comparing the length of the cache with its limit. This suggests that the `limit` attribute might be None or not initialized.

The potential error location is within the while loop where `self.limit` is being used to compare the length of the cache.

The occurrence of the bug is due to the fact that the `limit` attribute is not being initialized in the `__init__` method of the LocalCache class.

To fix the bug, you need to initialize the `limit` attribute in the `__init__` method of the LocalCache class.

```python
# Corrected function source code
class LocalCache(collections.OrderedDict):
    """
    Dictionary with a finite number of keys.
    
    Older items expires first.
    """

    def __init__(self, limit=1000, *args, **kwds):
        self.limit = limit
        super(LocalCache, self).__init__(*args, **kwds)

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        while len(self) >= self.limit:
            self.popitem(last=False)
        super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```

In the corrected code, we have added an `__init__` method that initializes the `limit` attribute with a default value of 1000. This allows the comparison in the `__setitem__` method to work without any errors.
