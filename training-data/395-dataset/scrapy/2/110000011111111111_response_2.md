The error message indicates a TypeError occurring in the '__setitem__' method of the LocalCache class. The error occurs at the line 'while len(self) >= self.limit', indicating that 'self.limit' is not defined.

The potential error location is at the line 'while len(self) >= self.limit'.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that 'self.limit' is not defined in the LocalCache class, which leads to a TypeError when trying to compare the length of 'self' with 'self.limit'.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that 'self.limit' is defined in the LocalCache class or pass the limit as a parameter. 

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected function
def __setitem__(self, key, value):
    if hasattr(self, 'limit') and self.limit is not None and len(self) >= self.limit:
        self.popitem(last=False)
    super().__setitem__(key, value)
```

In this corrected code, we first check if 'self.limit' is defined and not None before comparing it with the length of 'self'. If it meets the condition, we remove an item from the cache using 'popitem'. Then, we use 'super()' to call the '__setitem__' method from the superclass.
