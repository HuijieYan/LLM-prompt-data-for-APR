Potential error location: The while loop within the __setitem__ function is causing an issue.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug is likely occurring because the while loop was designed to remove items from the cache if its size exceeds a certain limit. However, the condition within the while loop does not seem to take the limit into account properly, which may result in an incorrect number of items being removed.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the while loop condition to correctly check if the size of the cache exceeds the limit.
2. Check if the 'limit' variable is properly defined and if it is being used correctly within the while loop condition.
3. Ensure that the 'popitem' and '__setitem__' functions are being called correctly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __setitem__(self, key, value):
    if len(self) >= self.limit:
        self.popitem(last=False)
    super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```
