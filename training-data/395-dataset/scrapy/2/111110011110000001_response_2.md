Potential error location: The error seems to be occurring within the while loop in the __setitem__ method of the LocalCache class.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
1. The error message indicates a "TypeError" in the while loop, specifically with the comparison operator ">=" between the length of the cache and self.limit.
2. The code snippet inside the while loop seems to be trying to limit the size of the cache by removing older items when it reaches a certain limit. However, the self.limit attribute is not defined in the current implementation of the LocalCache class.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define and initialize a self.limit attribute within the LocalCache class to specify the maximum number of items the cache can hold.
2. Modify the while loop condition to compare the length of the cache with the defined self.limit attribute.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
class LocalCache(collections.OrderedDict):
    """
    Dictionary with a finite number of keys.
    
    Older items expires first.
    """
    def __init__(self, limit=None):
        super().__init__()
        self.limit = limit

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        if self.limit is not None and len(self) >= self.limit:
            self.popitem(last=False)
        super().__setitem__(key, value)
```

In this corrected code, the LocalCache class now initializes the self.limit attribute in the __init__ method. Additionally, the while loop condition has been replaced with an if statement that checks whether the limit has been reached before adding a new item to the cache.
