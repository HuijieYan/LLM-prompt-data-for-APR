The potential error in the provided function is that it is defining the `__setitem__` method multiple times within the `LocalCache` class. This will only consider the last defined function as the actual method and override any previous definitions. This is a logical error and will cause unexpected behavior when the function is called.

To fix this issue, the multiple definitions of the `__setitem__` method within the `LocalCache` class should be removed and only one correct definition should be retained.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class LocalCache(collections.OrderedDict):
    """
    Dictionary with a finite number of keys.
    
    Older items expires first.
    """

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        while len(self) >= self.limit:
            self.popitem(last=False)
        super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```
