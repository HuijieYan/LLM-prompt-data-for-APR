Potential Error:
The error occurs at the line `while len(self) >= self.limit:` within the `__setitem__` method of the `LocalCache` class. The error message indicates a "TypeError" due to the comparison between the length of `self` (which is an integer) and `self.limit` (which is NoneType).

Reason for the Bug:
The error occurs because the `limit` attribute of the `LocalCache` class is not initialized, resulting in it being set as `None`. When the comparison `len(self) >= self.limit` is performed, it results in a TypeError since the comparison operator '>=' is not supported between an integer and NoneType.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Initialize the `limit` attribute of the `LocalCache` class to a default value, such as `float('inf')` for an unbounded cache.
2. Alternatively, include a parameter for `limit` in the constructor of the `LocalCache` class, allowing the user to specify a limit for the cache size.

Corrected Code:
```python
class LocalCache:
    def __init__(self, limit=None):
        self.limit = limit
        # ... other initializations ...

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        if self.limit is None:
            super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
        else:
            while len(self) >= self.limit:
                self.popitem(last=False)
            super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```
