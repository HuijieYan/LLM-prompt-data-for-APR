The potential error in the given function is with the usage of `self.popitem(last=False)`. This is likely causing an AttributeError because the `popitem` method is not available within the `LocalCache` class.

The reason for the bug is that the `popitem` method is not a method of the `LocalCache` class. It seems like the intent of the code is to remove the oldest item from the cache if the limit is reached, and then add the new key-value pair.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to use a different approach to remove the oldest item from the cache when the limit is reached.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __setitem__(self, key, value):
    while len(self) >= self.limit:
        oldest_key = next(iter(self))
        del self[oldest_key]
    super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```

In the corrected code, we are getting the oldest key from the cache using `next(iter(self))`, and then using `del self[oldest_key]` to delete that key-value pair. Then, we proceed to add the new key-value pair using `super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)`.
