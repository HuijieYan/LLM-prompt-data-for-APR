1. The test case is trying to add items to the `LocalCache` without a set limit.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the while loop condition `while len(self) >= self.limit`.

3. The error message indicates a `TypeError` caused by comparing the length of `self` (which is an instance of `LocalCache`) to the `limit` attribute, which is not defined.

4. To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to check if the `limit` attribute is defined before entering the while loop. Additionally, if the limit is not set, the function should work as a regular dictionary and not limit the number of items. 

5. Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected function
def __setitem__(self, key, value):
    if hasattr(self, 'limit') and self.limit is not None:  # Check if limit is defined
        while len(self) >= self.limit:
            self.popitem(last=False)
    super(LocalCache, self).__setitem__(key, value)
```

This corrected function includes a check to see if the `limit` attribute is defined before entering the while loop. If the `limit` is not set, the function works as a regular dictionary and does not limit the number of items.
