The potential error in the provided code is that the function __setitem__ is using a while loop to check the length of self, but the code doesn't define what self is. Additionally, the variable self.limit is not defined in the code, so it will produce an error.

The error occurs because the code is trying to use a method (popitem) and a variable (limit) that have not been defined or provided in the code.

To fix the bug, we need to define the self variable and the limit variable. We can assume that self is a dictionary, and we can set a default value for the limit variable. If self is meant to be a custom data type or class, we would need to access the parent class and its methods in the correct way, and we have to ensure that the necessary methods and attributes are available.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class LocalCache:
    def __init__(self, limit=10):
        self.cache = {}
        self.limit = limit

    def __setitem__(self, key, value):
        while len(self.cache) >= self.limit:
            self.cache.popitem(last=False)
        self.cache[key] = value
```
