The potential error in the provided code is that the __init__ method is being defined multiple times with the same signature, which is not allowed in Python. Additionally, the super() function is being used incorrectly.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is the multiple definitions of the __init__ method with the same signature. Also, the super() function is not being used correctly to call the __init__ method of the superclass.

To fix this bug, we can remove the multiple definitions of the __init__ method and use the correct syntax for calling the __init__ method of the superclass using super().

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class CrawlerProcess:
    def __init__(self, settings):
        super().__init__(settings)
        install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
        configure_logging(settings)
        log_scrapy_info(settings)
```

In the corrected code, we have removed the multiple definitions of the __init__ method and used super() without explicitly passing the class name and self. This ensures that the __init__ method of the superclass is called correctly.
