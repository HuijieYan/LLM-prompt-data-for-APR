The error occurred because the `log_scrapy_info` function is trying to access the 'BOT_NAME' key in the `settings` dictionary, but it does not exist. This is because the `settings` dictionary passed to the `CrawlerProcess` class during initialization is missing essential keys such as 'BOT_NAME'.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that all required keys are present in the `settings` dictionary before invoking the `log_scrapy_info` function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self, settings):
    if 'BOT_NAME' not in settings:
        settings['BOT_NAME'] = 'Scrapy'

    super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
    install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
    configure_logging(settings)
    log_scrapy_info(settings)
```

In this corrected code, we first check if the 'BOT_NAME' key is present in the `settings` dictionary. If it is not, we set a default value of 'Scrapy' for the 'BOT_NAME' key. After that, we proceed with the rest of the original code. This ensures that the `log_scrapy_info` function will always have the required 'BOT_NAME' key in the `settings` dictionary and will not cause the KeyError.
