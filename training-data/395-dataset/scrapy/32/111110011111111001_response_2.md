The error message indicates that the 'BOT_NAME' key is missing in the settings dictionary when the function log_scrapy_info is called. This likely means that the settings are not properly initialized before being used in the function.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the order in which the operations are performed. It seems that the settings are being used before they are fully initialized.

The bug occurs because the log_scrapy_info function is trying to access the 'BOT_NAME' key from the settings dictionary, but the 'BOT_NAME' key is not present in the input settings dictionary. This causes a KeyError.

To fix the bug, the order of operations within the __init__ function needs to be adjusted so that the settings are properly initialized before they are used in the log_scrapy_info function.

Here's the corrected code for the __init__ function:

```python
def __init__(self, settings):
    super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
    install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
    self.settings = settings  # Initialize settings
    configure_logging(self.settings)  # Use the initialized settings
    log_scrapy_info(self.settings)  # Use the initialized settings
```

In this corrected code, the settings are first initialized by setting `self.settings = settings`, and then the initialized settings are used in the `configure_logging` and `log_scrapy_info` functions. This ensures that the settings are properly initialized before they are used.
