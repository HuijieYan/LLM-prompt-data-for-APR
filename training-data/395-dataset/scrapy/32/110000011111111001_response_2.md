The error seems to be related to the `BOT_NAME` key missing in the `settings` dictionary, which leads to a `KeyError` when the `log_scrapy_info` function is called.

The problem is occurring because the `settings` dictionary passed to the `CrawlerProcess` class does not contain the required key `BOT_NAME`. This key is expected by the `log_scrapy_info` function, and its absence is causing the KeyError.

To fix this issue, the `settings` dictionary needs to include the `BOT_NAME` key and its corresponding value. One possible approach to fixing the bug is to ensure that the `BOT_NAME` key is present in the `settings` dictionary when it is passed to the `CrawlerProcess` class.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Fix for the buggy function
def __init__(self, settings):
    settings.setdefault('BOT_NAME', 'scrapybot')  # Adding default value for BOT_NAME if not present
    super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
    install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
    configure_logging(settings)
    log_scrapy_info(settings)
```

By using the `setdefault` method on the `settings` dictionary, we can ensure that the `BOT_NAME` key is present with a default value if it is not already set.

With this fix, the `BOT_NAME` key will always be present in the `settings` dictionary, preventing the KeyError when the `log_scrapy_info` function is called.
