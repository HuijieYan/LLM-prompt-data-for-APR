The potential error in the provided code is that the `__init__` method does not have the `self` parameter as the first parameter, which is necessary for instance methods in Python.

The reason for the bug is that the `self` parameter is missing in the `__init__` method, which is essential for instance methods to access the instance attributes and methods.

To fix the bug, we need to add the `self` parameter as the first parameter in the `__init__` method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self, settings):
    super().__init__(settings)
    install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
    configure_logging(settings)
    log_scrapy_info(settings)
```
