The error message indicates a KeyError on 'BOT_NAME' within the log_scrapy_info function. This error occurs because the 'BOT_NAME' key is not present in the settings dictionary that is passed into the CrawlerProcess constructor.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the missing initialization of 'BOT_NAME' key in the settings dictionary.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the 'BOT_NAME' key is present in the settings dictionary when the CrawlerProcess constructor is called. We can achieve this by either adding a default value for 'BOT_NAME' in the settings or by checking for the existence of 'BOT_NAME' key and initializing it with a default value if it does not exist.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self, settings):
    if 'BOT_NAME' not in settings:
        settings['BOT_NAME'] = 'ScrapyBot'
    super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
    install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
    configure_logging(settings)
    log_scrapy_info(settings)
```

By ensuring that the 'BOT_NAME' key is present in the settings dictionary with a default value, we prevent the KeyError from occurring during the log_scrapy_info function call.
