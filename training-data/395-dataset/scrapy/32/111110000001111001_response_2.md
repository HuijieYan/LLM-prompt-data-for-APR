The issue with the provided code is that the `__init__` method is defined twice in the `CrawlerProcess` class. The first `__init__` method is being overridden by the second one, which leads to unexpected behavior.

To fix the issue, the second `__init__` method should be removed, and its content should be merged into the first `__init__` method. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class CrawlerProcess(CrawlerRunner):
    """
    A class to run multiple scrapy crawlers in a process simultaneously.

    This class extends :class:`~scrapy.crawler.CrawlerRunner` by adding support
    for starting a Twisted `reactor`_ and handling shutdown signals, like the
    keyboard interrupt command Ctrl-C. It also configures top-level logging.

    This utility should be a better fit than
    :class:`~scrapy.crawler.CrawlerRunner` if you aren't running another
    Twisted `reactor`_ within your application.

    The CrawlerProcess object must be instantiated with a
    :class:`~scrapy.settings.Settings` object.

    This class shouldn't be needed (since Scrapy is responsible of using it
    accordingly) unless writing scripts that manually handle the crawling
    process. See :ref:`run-from-script` for an example.
    """

    def __init__(self, settings):
        super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
        install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
        configure_logging(settings)
        log_scrapy_info(settings)

    # ... omitted code ...
```

By removing the second `__init__` method and merging its content into the first one, we ensure that the initialization logic is correctly executed when an instance of `CrawlerProcess` is created.
