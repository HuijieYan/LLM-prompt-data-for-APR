1. The test case is trying to create a `CrawlerProcess` instance with a dictionary of settings, and then it is asserting the values of some settings.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the incorrect initialization of the `CrawlerProcess` class.

3. The error is occurring because the `log_scrapy_info` function is trying to access the 'BOT_NAME' key in the settings dictionary, but the 'BOT_NAME' key is not present in the provided settings.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the 'BOT_NAME' key is present in the settings before calling the `log_scrapy_info` function. Additionally, we need to initialize the `CrawlerProcess` class correctly to accept the settings dictionary.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected function
class CrawlerProcess:
    def __init__(self, settings=None):
        if settings is None:
            settings = {}
        super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
        install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
        configure_logging(settings)
        log_scrapy_info(settings)
```

With this correction, we ensure that the `CrawlerProcess` class accepts a settings dictionary as an optional argument. If no settings are provided, an empty dictionary is used. This prevents the KeyError from occurring and initializes the `CrawlerProcess` class correctly.
