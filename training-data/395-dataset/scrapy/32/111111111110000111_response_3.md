The error message indicates that there is a KeyError when trying to access the 'BOT_NAME' key from the settings dictionary. This means that the 'BOT_NAME' key is missing in the settings dictionary. 

The root cause of this bug is that the 'BOT_NAME' key is not being set in the settings object before it is used in the log_scrapy_info function.

To fix this issue, the 'BOT_NAME' key needs to be set in the settings object before it is passed to the log_scrapy_info function.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self, settings):
        super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
        install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
        settings.set('BOT_NAME', 'Scrapy')  # Set the 'BOT_NAME' key in the settings object
        configure_logging(settings)
        log_scrapy_info(settings)
```
