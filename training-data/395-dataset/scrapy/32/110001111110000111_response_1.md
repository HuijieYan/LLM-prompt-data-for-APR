The error message indicates a KeyError when trying to access the 'BOT_NAME' key in the `settings` dictionary in the `log_scrapy_info` function. This suggests that the 'BOT_NAME' key is missing from the `settings` dictionary.

The potential error location within the problematic function is when the `log_scrapy_info` function is called with the `settings` dictionary that does not contain the 'BOT_NAME' key.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the 'BOT_NAME' key is not being set in the `settings` dictionary when it is passed to the `CrawlerProcess` constructor.

To fix the bug, the 'BOT_NAME' key needs to be set in the `settings` dictionary before it is passed to the `CrawlerProcess` constructor.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected function
def __init__(self, settings):
    if 'BOT_NAME' not in settings:
        settings['BOT_NAME'] = 'scrapybot'  # Default value for 'BOT_NAME' if it's not present in settings
    super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
    install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
    configure_logging(settings)
    log_scrapy_info(settings)
```

With this correction, the 'BOT_NAME' key is checked and added to the `settings` dictionary if it is not already present. This should resolve the KeyError issue when calling `log_scrapy_info` with the `settings` dictionary.
