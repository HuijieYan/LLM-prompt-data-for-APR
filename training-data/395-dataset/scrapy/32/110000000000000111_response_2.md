The potential error in the provided function is that it is missing the class definition for the CrawlerProcess. This function seems to be the constructor for the CrawlerProcess class, but it is not properly defined.

The error occurs because the function is written as if it is inside a class, but it is not properly defined as a class method.

To fix this, we need to properly define the CrawlerProcess class and then define the __init__ method within the class.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class CrawlerProcess:
    def __init__(self, settings):
        super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
        install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
        configure_logging(settings)
        log_scrapy_info(settings)
```

In this corrected code, we properly define the CrawlerProcess class and then define the __init__ method within the class. Now the function should work as intended.
