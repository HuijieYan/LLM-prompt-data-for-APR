The error message indicates that the 'BOT_NAME' key is missing in the 'settings' dictionary when the 'log_scrapy_info' function is called. This is causing a KeyError.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the 'log_scrapy_info(settings)' line.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the 'settings' dictionary passed to the __init__ method is not containing the required 'BOT_NAME' key.

To fix the bug, the 'settings' dictionary passed to the __init__ method needs to be updated to include the 'BOT_NAME' key.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self, settings):
    super().__init__(settings)
    settings.set('BOT_NAME', 'MyBot')  # Add 'BOT_NAME' key to the settings
    install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
    configure_logging(settings)
    log_scrapy_info(settings)
```

In this corrected code, we use the `set` method to add the 'BOT_NAME' key to the settings before calling other functions that rely on it.
