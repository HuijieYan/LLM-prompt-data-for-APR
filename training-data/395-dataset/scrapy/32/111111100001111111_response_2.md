The main issue with the provided code is the presence of multiple `__init__` methods within the `CrawlerProcess` class, which is causing confusion and potential conflicts. Additionally, the `__init__` method provided at the end attempts to override the super class `__init__` method, but it does not match the signature of the super class method.

To fix this issue, the duplicate `__init__` methods should be removed, and the signature of the overridden `__init__` method should match the signature of the super class method.

Here's the corrected code for the `CrawlerProcess` class with the corrected `__init__` method:

```python
class CrawlerProcess(CrawlerRunner):
    """
    A class to run multiple scrapy crawlers in a process simultaneously.
    
    This class extends :class:`~scrapy.crawler.CrawlerRunner` by adding support
    for starting a Twisted `reactor`_ and handling shutdown signals, like the
    keyboard interrupt command Ctrl-C. It also configures top-level logging.
    
    This utility should be a better fit than
    :class:`~scrapy.crawler.CrawlerRunner` if you aren't running another
    Twisted `reactor`_ within your application.
    
    The CrawlerProcess object must be instantiated with a
    :class:`~scrapy.settings.Settings` object.
    
    This class shouldn't be needed (since Scrapy is responsible of using it
    accordingly) unless writing scripts that manually handle the crawling
    process. See :ref:`run-from-script` for an example.
    """

    # signature of the corrected __init__ function of this class
    def __init__(self, settings):
        super().__init__(settings)  # call the super class __init__ method
        install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
        configure_logging(settings)
        log_scrapy_info(settings)
```
