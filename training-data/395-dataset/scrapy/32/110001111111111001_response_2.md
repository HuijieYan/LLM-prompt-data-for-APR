The error occurs because the function `log_scrapy_info(settings)` tries to access a key 'BOT_NAME' in the `settings` dictionary which is not present.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `log_scrapy_info(settings)` call, where it tries to access the 'BOT_NAME' key.

The bug occurred because the settings dictionary passed to the `CrawlerProcess` constructor does not contain the 'BOT_NAME' key.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the 'BOT_NAME' key is present in the settings dictionary before calling `log_scrapy_info(settings)`. We can either add the 'BOT_NAME' key to the settings dictionary that is passed as a parameter, or we can modify the `log_scrapy_info` function to handle the case where 'BOT_NAME' key is not present.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def __init__(self, settings):
    super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
    settings.setdict({
        'BOT_NAME': 'Scrapy'  # default value for BOT_NAME
    }, priority='project')
    install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
    configure_logging(settings)
    log_scrapy_info(settings)
```

In this corrected code, we use `settings.setdict()` to set the default value for 'BOT_NAME' if it's not already present in the settings dictionary. This ensures that the 'BOT_NAME' key is always present before calling `log_scrapy_info(settings)`.
