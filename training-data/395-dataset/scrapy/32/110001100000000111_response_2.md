Potential error location: The error is likely occurring because the `CrawlerProcess` class is not defined properly and the `__init__` method inside the class is not properly implemented.

Reason behind the bug: The `__init__` method inside the `CrawlerProcess` class is not implemented correctly. It is missing the `self` parameter and is not calling the `__init__` method of the parent class.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, we need to properly define the `CrawlerProcess` class and implement the `__init__` method with the correct parameters and call the parent class' `__init__` method using `super()`.

Corrected code:

```python
class CrawlerProcess:
    def __init__(self, settings):
        super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
        install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
        configure_logging(settings)
        log_scrapy_info(settings)
    
    def _signal_shutdown(self, signum, _):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass
```
In the corrected code, we define the `CrawlerProcess` class with the correct `__init__` method that calls the parent class' `__init__` method using `super()`. We also define the `_signal_shutdown` method within the class.
