The potential error in the buggy function is that it has multiple __init__ methods with the same signature in the CrawlerProcess class, which is not allowed in Python.

The reason for the bug is that the __init__ method is defined multiple times with the same signature, causing confusion for the interpreter about which method to use.

To fix the bug, we should remove the duplicate __init__ method definitions and consolidate them into a single __init__ method that incorporates the functionality from all the duplicate methods.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self, settings):
    super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
    install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
    configure_logging(settings)
    log_scrapy_info(settings)
```
