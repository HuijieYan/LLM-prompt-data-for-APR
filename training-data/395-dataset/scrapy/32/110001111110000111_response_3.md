The error message indicates that there is a KeyError when trying to access the 'BOT_NAME' key in the settings dictionary. This error occurs within the `log_scrapy_info` function which is called inside the `__init__` method of the `CrawlerProcess` class.

The potential error location within the `CrawlerProcess` class is that the 'BOT_NAME' key is missing from the settings dictionary when the `log_scrapy_info` function is called.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the 'BOT_NAME' key is not present in the settings dictionary when it is passed to the `CrawlerProcess` class.

To fix this bug, the 'BOT_NAME' key needs to be added to the settings dictionary before it is passed to the `CrawlerProcess` class. Additionally, the `log_scrapy_info` function should be called after the settings dictionary has been updated with the 'BOT_NAME' key.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `CrawlerProcess` class:

```python
def __init__(self, settings):
    super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
    settings.setdict('BOT_NAME', 'my_scrapy_bot')  # Add BOT_NAME to settings
    install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
    configure_logging(settings)
    log_scrapy_info(settings)
```

With these changes, the 'BOT_NAME' key is added to the settings dictionary before calling the `log_scrapy_info` function, thus resolving the KeyError.
