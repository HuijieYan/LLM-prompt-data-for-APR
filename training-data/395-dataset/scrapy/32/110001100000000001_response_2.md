Potential error location: The error is occurring in the `__init__` method of the `CrawlerProcess` class.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The error is occurring because the `__init__` method is creating multiple conflicting definitions of the `__init__` method within the same class.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Remove the duplicate `__init__` methods and consolidate all the code within a single `__init__` method.
2. Update the method signature to include the required parameters for the `CrawlerProcess` class.

Corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_32/scrapy/crawler.py

class CrawlerProcess:
    def __init__(self, settings, spidercls=None):
        # ... omitted code ...
        super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
        install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
        configure_logging(settings)
        log_scrapy_info(settings)
    
    def _signal_shutdown(self, signum, _):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass
```
