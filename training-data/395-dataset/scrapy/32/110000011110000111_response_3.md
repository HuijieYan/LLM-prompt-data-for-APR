The problem with the provided code is that the __init__ method is not correctly implemented and does not take the 'self' parameter, which is essential for any class method in Python.

Given the error message from the test function, it appears that the 'settings' dictionary passed to the CrawlerProcess is missing the 'BOT_NAME' key, which is causing a KeyError when the log_scrapy_info function tries to access it.

To fix this issue, the __init__ method needs to be re-implemented to correctly initialize the object and ensure that the 'BOT_NAME' key is present in the settings dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class CrawlerProcess:
    def __init__(self, settings):
        self.settings = settings
        install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
        configure_logging(settings)
        log_scrapy_info(settings)
```

In this corrected code, the __init__ method is defined with the 'self' parameter as the first argument to properly initialize the object. The settings are stored as an attribute of the object, and then used within the method to configure the logging and log the Scrapy info.
