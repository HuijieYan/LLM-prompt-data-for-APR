The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `CrawlerProcess` class. This method is intended to initialize the `CrawlerProcess` object with the provided settings and perform some additional setup related to signal handling and logging.

The bug in this function is that it is redefining the `__init__` method with a different signature and not calling the parent class's `__init__` method properly.

To fix the bug, the corrected code for the `__init__` method would be:
```python
class CrawlerProcess(CrawlerRunner):
    def __init__(self, settings):
        super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
        install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown) # assuming _signal_shutdown is a valid function defined in the class
        configure_logging(settings)
        log_scrapy_info(settings)
```

In this corrected code, we are properly calling the parent class's `__init__` method using `super()` to ensure that the necessary initialization from the parent class is executed. Then, the additional setup steps are performed as intended.
