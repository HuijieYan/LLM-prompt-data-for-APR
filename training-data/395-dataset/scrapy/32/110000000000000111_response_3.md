The error in the provided code is that the `__init__` method is not properly defined within a class. The `__init__` method should be defined within a class and it seems like it's missing the class definition.

To fix the bug:
1. We need to define a class and then define the `__init__` method within that class.
2. Use the correct syntax to call the superclass's `__init__` method using `super()`.
3. Ensure that the `install_shutdown_handlers`, `configure_logging`, and `log_scrapy_info` functions are either defined within the class or are called with the correct context.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class CrawlerProcess:
    def __init__(self, settings):
        super().__init__(settings)
        install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
        configure_logging(settings)
        log_scrapy_info(settings)
```

In this corrected code, we define the `CrawlerProcess` class and correctly define the `__init__` method within the class. We call the superclass's `__init__` method using `super()`.
