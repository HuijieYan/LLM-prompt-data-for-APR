The error message indicates a KeyError on the line `settings['BOT_NAME']` in the `log_scrapy_info` function. This error occurs because the 'BOT_NAME' key is not present in the `settings` dictionary.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the 'BOT_NAME' key is present in the `settings` dictionary before accessing it in the `log_scrapy_info` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method and the `log_scrapy_info` function:

```python
# Corrected __init__ method
def __init__(self, settings):
    super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
    install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
    configure_logging(settings)
    if 'BOT_NAME' not in settings:
        settings['BOT_NAME'] = 'ScrapyBot'
    log_scrapy_info(settings)


# Corrected log_scrapy_info function
def log_scrapy_info(settings):
    bot_name = settings.get('BOT_NAME', 'ScrapyBot')
    logger.info("Scrapy %(version)s started (bot: %(bot)s)",
                {'version': scrapy.__version__, 'bot': bot_name})
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the 'BOT_NAME' key exists in the `settings` dictionary. If it does not exist, we set a default value of 'ScrapyBot'. Then, in the `log_scrapy_info` function, we use the `get` method to retrieve the value of 'BOT_NAME' from the `settings` dictionary with a default value of 'ScrapyBot'.

These changes ensure that the code does not throw a KeyError when accessing the 'BOT_NAME' key in the `log_scrapy_info` function.
