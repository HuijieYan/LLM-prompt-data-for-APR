Potential Error Location:
The error occurred in the `log_scrapy_info` function when trying to access the 'BOT_NAME' key in the `settings` dictionary. This indicates that the 'BOT_NAME' key is missing from the settings dictionary, leading to a KeyError.

Reason behind the Bug:
The bug is caused by the missing 'BOT_NAME' key in the settings dictionary that is being used by the `log_scrapy_info` function. It seems that the settings object is not properly initialized or configured with the required keys and values.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the settings object is properly initialized and configured with the required keys and values, including the 'BOT_NAME' key.
2. Verify that the `CrawlerProcess` class is correctly initializing and passing the settings object.

Corrected Code:
```python
class CrawlerProcess(CrawlerRunner):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def __init__(self, settings):
        super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)

        if 'BOT_NAME' not in settings:
            settings['BOT_NAME'] = 'scrapybot'

        install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
        configure_logging(settings)
        log_scrapy_info(settings)
```
In the corrected code, before using the `settings` object, we first check if the 'BOT_NAME' key exists. If it does not exist, we set a default value for 'BOT_NAME' as 'scrapybot'. This ensures that the `log_scrapy_info` function won't encounter a KeyError when trying to access the 'BOT_NAME' key.
