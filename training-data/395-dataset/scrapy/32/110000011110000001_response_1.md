The error message indicates a KeyError in the log_scrapy_info function, specifically due to the missing key 'BOT_NAME' in the settings dictionary. 

Upon analyzing the code, it is evident that the __init__ method of the CrawlerProcess class does not properly handle the settings passed to it. The error occurs when the log_scrapy_info function tries to access the 'BOT_NAME' key in the settings dictionary, which is not present.

To fix this issue, the __init__ method needs to initialize the settings properly and ensure that all required keys are present. One possible approach is to provide default values for settings that aren't explicitly provided.

Here's the corrected code for the __init__ method:

```python
def __init__(self, settings=None):
    if settings is None:
        settings = {}
    settings.setdefault('BOT_NAME', 'Scrapy')
    super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
    install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
    configure_logging(settings)
    log_scrapy_info(settings)
```

By setting the default value for 'BOT_NAME' within the settings and initializing the settings dictionary if it's not provided, the KeyError in the log_scrapy_info function should be resolved.
