The error message indicates a KeyError on the line where the function log_scrapy_info is called. The error occurs because the settings dictionary passed to the function does not contain the key 'BOT_NAME'.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the configure_logging or log_scrapy_info functions, where it is trying to access 'BOT_NAME' from the settings dictionary.

To fix the bug, the 'BOT_NAME' key needs to be present in the settings dictionary. We can either add the 'BOT_NAME' key to the dictionary before passing it to the function, or we can modify the function to handle the case where 'BOT_NAME' is not present.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self, settings):
    super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
    install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
    if 'BOT_NAME' not in settings:
        settings['BOT_NAME'] = 'Scrapy'
    configure_logging(settings)
    log_scrapy_info(settings)
```

In this corrected code, before calling the configure_logging and log_scrapy_info functions, we first check if the 'BOT_NAME' key is present in the settings dictionary. If it's not present, we assign a default value 'Scrapy' to it. This prevents the KeyError from occurring.
