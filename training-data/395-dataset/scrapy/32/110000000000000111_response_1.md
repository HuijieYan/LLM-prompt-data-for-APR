The error in the given code is that the `__init__` method is not properly defined in the class. The `__init__` method is used to initialize the object's attributes. 

Here are the potential fixes for this bug:

1. Define the `__init__` method inside a class by removing the `self` parameter from the method.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
class CrawlerProcess:
    def __init__(self, settings):
        super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
        install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
        configure_logging(settings)
        log_scrapy_info(settings)
```
