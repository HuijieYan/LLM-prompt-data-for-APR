Potential error location: The buggy function is the `__init__` method of the `CrawlerProcess` class.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `__init__` method is defined twice in the `CrawlerProcess` class, which is causing the second definition to override the first one.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Remove the second definition of the `__init__` method and combine the code from both definitions into a single `__init__` method.

Corrected code:
```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class CrawlerProcess(CrawlerRunner):
    """
    A class to run multiple scrapy crawlers in a process simultaneously.
    
    This class extends :class:`~scrapy.crawler.CrawlerRunner` by adding support
    for starting a Twisted `reactor`_ and handling shutdown signals, like the
    keyboard interrupt command Ctrl-C. It also configures top-level logging.
    
    This utility should be a better fit than
    :class:`~scrapy.crawler.CrawlerRunner` if you aren't running another
    Twisted `reactor`_ within your application.
    
    The CrawlerProcess object must be instantiated with a
    :class:`~scrapy.settings.Settings` object.
    
    This class shouldn't be needed (since Scrapy is responsible of using it
    accordingly) unless writing scripts that manually handle the crawling
    process. See :ref:`run-from-script` for an example.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # corrected definition of the __init__ method
    def __init__(self, settings):
        super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
        install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
        configure_logging(settings)
        log_scrapy_info(settings)
```
In the corrected code, we have removed the second definition of the `__init__` method and combined the code into a single `__init__` method.
