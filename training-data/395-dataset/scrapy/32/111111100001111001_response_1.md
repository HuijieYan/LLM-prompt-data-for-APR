The potential error in the given code is that there are three different __init__ methods with different parameter signatures in the class CrawlerProcess. This is not allowed in Python as it does not support method overloading. Only the last __init__ method will be considered and the previous ones will be overridden.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that there are multiple __init__ methods with different signatures, and only the last one will be used, leading to the loss of the functionality defined in the previous __init__ methods.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the duplicate __init__ methods and consolidate the functionality into a single __init__ method with the correct signature. Also, we need to ensure that the necessary code is called only once.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class CrawlerProcess(CrawlerRunner):
    """
    A class to run multiple scrapy crawlers in a process simultaneously.
    
    This class extends :class:`~scrapy.crawler.CrawlerRunner` by adding support
    for starting a Twisted `reactor`_ and handling shutdown signals, like the
    keyboard interrupt command Ctrl-C. It also configures top-level logging.
    
    This utility should be a better fit than
    :class:`~scrapy.crawler.CrawlerRunner` if you aren't running another
    Twisted `reactor`_ within your application.
    
    The CrawlerProcess object must be instantiated with a
    :class:`~scrapy.settings.Settings` object.
    
    This class shouldn't be needed (since Scrapy is responsible of using it
    accordingly) unless writing scripts that manually handle the crawling
    process. See :ref:`run-from-script` for an example.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, settings):
        super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
        install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
        configure_logging(settings)
        log_scrapy_info(settings)
    
    def _signal_shutdown(self, signum, _):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass
```
