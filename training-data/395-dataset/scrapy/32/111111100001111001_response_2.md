The bug in the provided code is that there are multiple `__init__` methods with the same signature in the `CrawlerProcess` class. This will cause confusion and ambiguity, as the interpreter won't know which `__init__` method to use when instantiating the object.

To fix this bug, you should remove the extra `__init__` methods and combine their functionality into a single `__init__` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `CrawlerProcess` class:

```python
class CrawlerProcess(CrawlerRunner):
    """
    A class to run multiple scrapy crawlers in a process simultaneously.
    
    This class extends :class:`~scrapy.crawler.CrawlerRunner` by adding support
    for starting a Twisted `reactor`_ and handling shutdown signals, like the
    keyboard interrupt command Ctrl-C. It also configures top-level logging.
    
    This utility should be a better fit than
    :class:`~scrapy.crawler.CrawlerRunner` if you aren't running another
    Twisted `reactor`_ within your application.
    
    The CrawlerProcess object must be instantiated with a
    :class:`~scrapy.settings.Settings` object.
    
    This class shouldn't be needed (since Scrapy is responsible of using it
    accordingly) unless writing scripts that manually handle the crawling
    process. See :ref:`run-from-script` for an example.
    """

    def __init__(self, settings):
        super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
        install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
        configure_logging(settings)
        log_scrapy_info(settings)

    def _signal_shutdown(self, signum, _):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass
```

In this corrected code, the extra `__init__` methods have been removed, and the functionality from those methods has been combined into the single `__init__` method. The `_signal_shutdown` method has been retained as is.
