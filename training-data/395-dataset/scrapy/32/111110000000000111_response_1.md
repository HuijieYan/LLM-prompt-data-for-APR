The issue with the provided code is that the `CrawlerProcess` class has two `__init__` methods, which is not allowed in Python. The second `__init__` method is attempting to override the first one, which causes the error.

To fix this issue, we need to combine the functionality of both `__init__` methods into a single one. We can do this by moving the code from the second `__init__` method into the first one and removing the second one.

Here's the corrected code for the `CrawlerProcess` class:

```python
class CrawlerProcess(CrawlerRunner):
    """
    A class to run multiple scrapy crawlers in a process simultaneously.
    
    This class extends :class:`~scrapy.crawler.CrawlerRunner` by adding support
    for starting a Twisted `reactor`_ and handling shutdown signals, like the
    keyboard interrupt command Ctrl-C. It also configures top-level logging.
    
    This utility should be a better fit than
    :class:`~scrapy.crawler.CrawlerRunner` if you aren't running another
    Twisted `reactor`_ within your application.
    
    The CrawlerProcess object must be instantiated with a
    :class:`~scrapy.settings.Settings` object.
    
    This class shouldn't be needed (since Scrapy is responsible of using it
    accordingly) unless writing scripts that manually handle the crawling
    process. See :ref:`run-from-script` for an example.
    """

    def __init__(self, settings):
        super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
        install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
        configure_logging(settings)
        log_scrapy_info(settings)

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def _signal_shutdown(self, signum, _):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass
```

In the corrected code, we've combined the functionality of both `__init__` methods into a single one, and removed the second `__init__` method. Now the class should work without any issues related to duplicate `__init__` methods.
