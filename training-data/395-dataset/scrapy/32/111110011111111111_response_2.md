The error occurs because the `settings` dictionary passed to the `CrawlerProcess` constructor does not contain the key `'BOT_NAME'`, which is expected by the `log_scrapy_info` function. This causes a `KeyError` when the function tries to access `settings['BOT_NAME']`.

To fix this issue, the `CrawlerProcess` constructor should ensure that all required keys are present in the settings dictionary before calling functions that rely on those keys.

Here's the corrected code for the `CrawlerProcess` class:

```python
class CrawlerProcess(CrawlerRunner):
    """
    A class to run multiple scrapy crawlers in a process simultaneously.
    
    This class extends :class:`~scrapy.crawler.CrawlerRunner` by adding support
    for starting a Twisted `reactor`_ and handling shutdown signals, like the
    keyboard interrupt command Ctrl-C. It also configures top-level logging.
    
    This utility should be a better fit than
    :class:`~scrapy.crawler.CrawlerRunner` if you aren't running another
    Twisted `reactor`_ within your application.
    
    The CrawlerProcess object must be instantiated with a
    :class:`~scrapy.settings.Settings` object.
    
    This class shouldn't be needed (since Scrapy is responsible of using it
    accordingly) unless writing scripts that manually handle the crawling
    process. See :ref:`run-from-script` for an example.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def __init__(self, settings):
        # Ensure 'BOT_NAME' is present in settings
        if 'BOT_NAME' not in settings:
            raise KeyError("'BOT_NAME' is missing in settings")
        
        super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
        install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
        configure_logging(settings)
        log_scrapy_info(settings)
```

With this correction, the `CrawlerProcess` class will now enforce that the `'BOT_NAME'` key is present in the `settings` dictionary before using it, preventing the `KeyError` that was occurring.
