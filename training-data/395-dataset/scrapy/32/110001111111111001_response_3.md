Potential error location:
The error occurs in the "log_scrapy_info" function within the "__init__" method of the CrawlerProcess class. It is trying to access the 'BOT_NAME' key from the settings dictionary, but it is not present in the input settings.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The 'BOT_NAME' key is missing from the input settings dictionary, which is causing a KeyError when the log_scrapy_info function tries to access it.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the input settings to include the 'BOT_NAME' key with an appropriate value before passing it to the CrawlerProcess class.
2. Handle the absence of the 'BOT_NAME' key within the log_scrapy_info function to prevent the KeyError.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def __init__(self, settings):
    super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
    install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
    configure_logging(settings)
    
    if 'BOT_NAME' not in settings:
        settings['BOT_NAME'] = 'default_bot'

    log_scrapy_info(settings)
```
