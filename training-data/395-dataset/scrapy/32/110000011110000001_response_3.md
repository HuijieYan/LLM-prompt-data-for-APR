The error message indicates a KeyError on the line where the function log_scrapy_info is called. The error occurs because the 'BOT_NAME' key is not present in the settings dictionary.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the 'BOT_NAME' key is present in the settings dictionary before calling the log_scrapy_info function. One approach to fix this bug is to check if 'BOT_NAME' exists in the settings dictionary before using it.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def __init__(self, settings):
    super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
    install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
    configure_logging(settings)
    if 'BOT_NAME' in settings:
        log_scrapy_info(settings)
```
