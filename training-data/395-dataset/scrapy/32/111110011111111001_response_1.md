The error message indicates that there is a KeyError when trying to access the 'BOT_NAME' key in the settings dictionary. This indicates that the 'BOT_NAME' key is missing in the settings dictionary.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `log_scrapy_info(settings)` line, where it is trying to access the 'BOT_NAME' key.

The reason behind this bug is that the 'BOT_NAME' key is not present in the settings dictionary being passed to the `CrawlerProcess` class.

To fix this bug, one possible approach is to ensure that the 'BOT_NAME' key is present in the settings dictionary. This can be achieved by either passing a complete settings dictionary with all required keys, or by dynamically adding the 'BOT_NAME' key if it is missing.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected CrawlerProcess class
class CrawlerProcess(CrawlerRunner):
    """
    A class to run multiple scrapy crawlers in a process simultaneously.
    
    This class extends :class:`~scrapy.crawler.CrawlerRunner` by adding support
    for starting a Twisted `reactor`_ and handling shutdown signals, like the
    keyboard interrupt command Ctrl-C. It also configures top-level logging.
    
    This utility should be a better fit than
    :class:`~scrapy.crawler.CrawlerRunner` if you aren't running another
    Twisted `reactor`_ within your application.
    
    The CrawlerProcess object must be instantiated with a
    :class:`~scrapy.settings.Settings` object.
    
    This class shouldn't be needed (since Scrapy is responsible of using it
    accordingly) unless writing scripts that manually handle the crawling
    process. See :ref:`run-from-script` for an example.
    """

    def __init__(self, settings):
        super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
        install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
        if 'BOT_NAME' not in settings:
            settings['BOT_NAME'] = 'scrapybot'
        configure_logging(settings)
        log_scrapy_info(settings)
```
