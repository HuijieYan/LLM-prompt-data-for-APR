Potential error location:
The error occurs in the `log_scrapy_info(settings)` function call within the `__init__` method. The error message indicates a KeyError related to the 'BOT_NAME' key in the settings dictionary.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The error occurs because the 'BOT_NAME' key is not present in the settings dictionary that is passed to the `log_scrapy_info` function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the 'BOT_NAME' key exists in the settings dictionary before accessing it within the `log_scrapy_info` function.
2. Ensure that the 'BOT_NAME' key is present in the settings dictionary before calling the `log_scrapy_info` function.

Corrected code:

```python
def __init__(self, settings):
    super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
    install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
    configure_logging(settings)
    if 'BOT_NAME' in settings:
        log_scrapy_info(settings)
```

In this corrected code, we have added a check to ensure that the 'BOT_NAME' key exists in the settings dictionary before calling the `log_scrapy_info` function. This will prevent the KeyError from occurring.
