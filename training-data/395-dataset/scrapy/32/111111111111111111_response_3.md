The bug occurs in the `CrawlerProcess` class's `__init__` method. When the `CrawlerProcess` class is initialized with a settings dictionary, it calls the `__init__` method to set up the crawler process. Within this method, it attempts to log Scrapy info using the `log_scrapy_info` function, which requires the 'BOT_NAME' setting to be present in the `settings` dictionary. 

However, the 'BOT_NAME' setting is missing from the input `settings` dictionary, causing a KeyError when trying to access it in the `log_scrapy_info` function.

To fix this bug, the 'BOT_NAME' setting needs to be added to the input `settings` dictionary. Additionally, the super call to the `CrawlerRunner` should also be removed as it is unnecessary.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, settings):
    from scrapy.utils.project import get_project_settings
    settings = get_project_settings() if settings is None else settings
    install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
    configure_logging(settings)
    log_scrapy_info(settings)
```

In this corrected code, we used the `get_project_settings` method which will ensure that the required settings, including 'BOT_NAME', are present. This will fix the KeyError issue when trying to access the 'BOT_NAME' setting.
