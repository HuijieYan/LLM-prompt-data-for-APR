The provided code seems to be a part of a class definition, specifically the constructor (__init__) for a class named CrawlerProcess. It seems to be intended to initialize the CrawlerProcess object with the given settings and perform some additional setup tasks like installing shutdown handlers, configuring logging, and logging Scrapy information.

The error in the provided code seems to be related to the usage of the super() function. In Python, when using super(), it should be called within a class definition and should be used to access the methods and properties of a parent class. However, in the provided code, it is not being used within a class definition. Additionally, the install_shutdown_handlers, configure_logging, and log_scrapy_info functions are not defined within the provided code, so it's assumed they are external functions.

To fix the code, the following changes can be made:
1. Define the CrawlerProcess class and its __init__ method properly.
2. Call the super() method within the __init__ method of the CrawlerProcess class to properly initialize the CrawlerProcess object with the given settings.
3. Define the install_shutdown_handlers, configure_logging, and log_scrapy_info functions or import them from their respective modules if they are external functions.

The corrected code for the problematic function would be:

```python
class CrawlerProcess:
    def __init__(self, settings):
        super().__init__(settings)  # Assuming CrawlerProcess inherits from a parent class
        install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)  # Assuming install_shutdown_handlers is defined
        configure_logging(settings)  # Assuming configure_logging is defined
        log_scrapy_info(settings)  # Assuming log_scrapy_info is defined
```

Please note that the assumptions made about the inheritance of CrawlerProcess and the definitions of external functions should be adjusted according to the actual code and requirements.
