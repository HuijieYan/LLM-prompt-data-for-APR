# class declaration containing the fixed function
class CrawlerProcess(CrawlerRunner):
    """
    A class to run multiple scrapy crawlers in a process simultaneously.
    
    This class extends :class:`~scrapy.crawler.CrawlerRunner` by adding support
    for starting a Twisted `reactor`_ and handling shutdown signals, like the
    keyboard interrupt command Ctrl-C. It also configures top-level logging.
    
    This utility should be a better fit than
    :class:`~scrapy.crawler.CrawlerRunner` if you aren't running another
    Twisted `reactor`_ within your application.
    
    The CrawlerProcess object must be instantiated with a
    :class:`~scrapy.settings.Settings` object.
    
    This class shouldn't be needed (since Scrapy is responsible of using it
    accordingly) unless writing scripts that manually handle the crawling
    process. See :ref:`run-from-script` for an example.
