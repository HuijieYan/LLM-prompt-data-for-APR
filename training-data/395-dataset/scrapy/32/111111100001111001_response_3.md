The bug in the provided function is that it defines the `__init__` method multiple times and the actual initialization logic is only present in the last defined `__init__` method. This will lead to the previous `__init__` methods being overridden and not being executed.

To fix this bug, we need to remove the redundant `__init__` methods and consolidate all the initialization logic into a single `__init__` method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self, settings):
    super(CrawlerProcess, self).__init__(settings)
    install_shutdown_handlers(self._signal_shutdown)
    configure_logging(settings)
    log_scrapy_info(settings)
```

In this fixed code, we have removed the redundant `__init__` methods and consolidated the initialization logic into a single `__init__` method. Now the function will correctly initialize the `CrawlerProcess` object with the provided settings.
