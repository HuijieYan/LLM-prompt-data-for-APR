The error message indicates that there is an issue with the "requestTunnel" function in the "TunnelingTCP4ClientEndpoint" class. Specifically, the error message points to the "write" method within the "requestTunnel" function.

The bug in the "requestTunnel" function could be related to the encoding type of the data being written, which is causing a "Data must not be unicode" error.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the data being written using the "write" method is encoded as bytes, not unicode. We can use the "encode" method to convert the string to bytes before writing it.

Here's the corrected code for the "requestTunnel" function:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost, self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq.encode())  # encode the string to bytes before writing
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```
