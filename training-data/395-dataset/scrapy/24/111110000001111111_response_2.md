The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `requestTunnel` method where the `protocol.dataReceived` is being reassigned.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `protocol.dataReceived` is being reassigned to `self.processProxyResponse`, which will override the original `dataReceived` method of the protocol.

To fix this bug, we should store the original `dataReceived` method before reassigning it, and also ensure that the `tunnelReq` is encoded properly before sending it.

Here's the corrected code for the `requestTunnel` method:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost.decode('utf-8'), self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    
    original_dataReceived = protocol.dataReceived  # store the original dataReceived method
    
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq.encode('utf-8'))  # encode tunnelReq before sending
    self._protocolDataReceived = original_dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```

In this corrected code, we have stored the original `dataReceived` method to `original_dataReceived` before reassigning it, and we have also encoded the `tunnelReq` before sending it.
