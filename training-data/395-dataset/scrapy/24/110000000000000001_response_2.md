Potential error: The potential error in the code is with the line `protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)`. It seems that the `protocol` object may not have a `transport` attribute, which could cause an AttributeError.

Reason for the bug: The `protocol` object may not have a `transport` attribute, or it may not support the `write` method, leading to an AttributeError when the function is called.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We can modify the function to accept the `transport` object as an argument, rather than trying to access it directly from the `protocol` object.

Corrected code:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol, transport):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost,
                                              self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    transport.write(tunnelReq)
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```

In this corrected code, the `requestTunnel` method now takes an additional `transport` argument. This allows the function to write the `tunnelReq` to the `transport` object, which should resolve the AttributeError issue.
