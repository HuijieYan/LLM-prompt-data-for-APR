The error message indicates that there is an issue with the data format being passed into the write method. This likely originates from the `requestTunnel` method in the `TunnelingTCP4ClientEndpoint` class.

The potential error location within the `requestTunnel` method is the line `protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)`. The `tunnelReq` variable contains the string `CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n`, and it appears that it should be encoded to bytes before being passed to `write`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `tunnelReq` string is being passed directly to the `write` method without being encoded to bytes, causing a `unicode` type error.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to encode the `tunnelReq` string to bytes before passing it to `write`. This can be achieved using the `encode` method, which converts the string to bytes using the specified encoding (e.g., UTF-8).

Here's the corrected code for the `requestTunnel` method:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost, self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq.encode('utf-8'))  # Encode to bytes
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```
