The error occurs inside the `requestTunnel` method of the `TunnelingTCP4ClientEndpoint` class. It seems that the `tunnelReq` variable is being declared as a bytes object, but is then being sent to the `protocol.transport.write()` method, leading to a TypeError stating "Data must not be unicode."

The reason behind this bug is that the `tunnelReq` variable is being encoded as bytes, but the `protocol.transport.write()` method expects a string, not bytes.

To fix this issue, the `tunnelReq` variable should be decoded to a string before being passed to `protocol.transport.write()` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `requestTunnel` method:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%d HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost.decode(), self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader.decode()
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq.encode())  # Sending encoded string instead of bytes
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```
