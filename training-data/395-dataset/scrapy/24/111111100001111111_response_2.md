The bug seems to be related to the `requestTunnel` function in the `TunnelingTCP4ClientEndpoint` class. The function tries to open a tunnel to a proxy, but it sets `protocol.dataReceived` to `self.processProxyResponse`, and then returns the `protocol` without reverting `protocol.dataReceived` back to its original value. This could cause unexpected behavior in the subsequent usage of the `protocol`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we revert `protocol.dataReceived` back to its original value after using `self.processProxyResponse`.

Here's the corrected code for the `requestTunnel` function:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost, self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    original_dataReceived = protocol.dataReceived  # Store the original value
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    # Revert protocol.dataReceived back to its original value
    protocol.dataReceived = original_dataReceived
    return protocol
```

By storing the original value of `protocol.dataReceived` and then reverting it back after using `self.processProxyResponse`, we ensure that the protocol's behavior is not unexpectedly altered after calling `requestTunnel`. This should fix the issue.
