Potential Error Location:
The error is likely occurring when the `processProxyResponse` method is assigned to `protocol.dataReceived`. This is because `processProxyResponse` has a different signature than `dataReceived`, and they might not be compatible.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The `processProxyResponse` method has a different signature than the `dataReceived` method that it is trying to replace. This could lead to compatibility issues and cause the program to break.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Change the signature of the `processProxyResponse` method to match the signature of `dataReceived`.
2. Create a new method that has the same signature as `dataReceived` and use that as the replacement.
3. Use a wrapper function to convert the signature of `processProxyResponse` to match the signature of `dataReceived`.

Corrected Code:
```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost, self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```
