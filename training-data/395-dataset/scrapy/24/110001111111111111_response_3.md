The error seems to be related to the data type being a Unicode string when it should be bytes.

1. The error message indicates that a TypeError is being raised because the data must not be Unicode.
2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the `protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)` line, where `tunnelReq` should be of type `bytes` but might be of type `str` (Unicode string).
3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that `tunnelReq` is being concatenated with string literals and stored as a Unicode string. It should instead be encoded as bytes before being sent over the network.
4. To fix the bug, the `tunnelReq` string should be encoded into bytes before being sent using `protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq.encode())`.
5. Here's the corrected code for the `requestTunnel` function:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost, self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq.encode())  # Encode tunnelReq into bytes
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```
