The potential error in the `requestTunnel` function is that it sets the `dataReceived` method of the `protocol` to `self.processProxyResponse`, without saving the original `dataReceived` method. This means that the original `dataReceived` method is lost and cannot be restored.

The reason for the bug is that the function does not save the original `dataReceived` method before overwriting it, making it impossible to revert to the original behavior after the tunneling is complete.

To fix the bug, the original `dataReceived` method should be saved before it is overwritten, and then restored once the tunneling is complete.

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost, self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)
    
    # Save the original dataReceived method
    self._originalDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    
    # Overwrite the dataReceived method
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse

    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```

By saving the original `dataReceived` method in the `requestTunnel` function, and restoring it after the tunneling is complete, we can ensure that the behavior of the `protocol` is not permanently altered by the tunneling process.
