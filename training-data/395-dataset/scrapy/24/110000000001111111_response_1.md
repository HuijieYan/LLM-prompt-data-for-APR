The potential error in the `requestTunnel` function is the line `protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)`. This line is likely causing an error because the `protocol.transport` is not a valid attribute or method, which is why the error occurs when trying to call `write` on it.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `protocol` object does not have a `transport` attribute/method. It seems like the intention of the code is to send the `tunnelReq` to the server, but the current implementation is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we can use `protocol.makeConnection` to establish the connection and send the `tunnelReq` to the server.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost, self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    protocol.makeConnection(Protocol)
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```
