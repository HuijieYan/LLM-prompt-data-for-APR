The error message indicates that the `write` method of the `protocol` object is failing due to a TypeError: "Data must not be unicode". This error is occurring in the `requestTunnel` method, specifically when writing the `tunnelReq` to the `protocol.transport`.

The issue is likely due to the data type of `tunnelReq`. It seems that the `tunnelReq` is a Unicode string, which is causing the `TypeError` when trying to write it to the transport.

To fix this issue, the `tunnelReq` should be encoded to bytes before writing it to the transport. This can be accomplished by using the `encode` method on the string.

Here's the corrected code for the `requestTunnel` method:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = ('CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost, self._tunneledPort)).encode('utf-8')
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += ('Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader).encode('utf-8')
    tunnelReq += b'\r\n'
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```

By encoding `tunnelReq` to UTF-8 bytes, it ensures that the data being written to the transport is in the correct format and should resolve the "Data must not be unicode" TypeError.
