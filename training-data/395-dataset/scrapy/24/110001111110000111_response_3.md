The error message suggests that there is an issue with the data handling when writing, indicating a potential Unicode-related error. 

The problematic function is `requestTunnel`, and the error arises from the line `protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)` within this function. It is likely that the `tunnelReq` string is being treated as a Unicode object, causing this error during writing.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `tunnelReq` string is encoded properly before writing. We can use the `encode()` method to encode the string as bytes before writing it to the transport.

Here's the corrected function with the encoding modification:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost, self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq.encode('utf-8'))  # Encode the string to bytes before writing
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```

By encoding the `tunnelReq` string into bytes using `encode('utf-8')`, we can prevent the Unicode-related error and fix the bug.
