The error message indicates that the issue occurs within the `requestTunnel` method of a class, especially when the `protocol.transport.write` is called.

The root cause of the error is that the provided input domain (no-such-domain.nosuch) does not exist, which causes the connection attempt to fail when establishing a tunnel with the proxy. The string `b'no-such-domain.nosuch'` is of type bytes, which can potentially lead to a Unicode-related error. Additionally, the attempted use of the non-existent domain resulted in a `TimeoutError`.

To fix this issue, the function should handle potential errors related to establishing a tunnel with the proxy and ensure that the data types being used are consistent to avoid conversion errors.

Here's the corrected code for the `requestTunnel` method:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel with error handling."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost.decode('utf-8'),
                                              self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader.decode('utf-8')
        
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    
    try:
        protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq.encode('utf-8'))
        self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
        protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
        self._protocol = protocol
        return protocol
    except Exception as e:
        # Handle the exception, e.g., print an error message or log the error.
        print(f"An error occurred while requesting tunnel: {e}")
```

In the corrected code:
- The `tunneledHost` and `proxyAuthHeader` are decoded from bytes to UTF-8 strings before being used in the tunnel request.
- The `tunnelReq` is encoded to bytes using UTF-8 before calling `protocol.transport.write`.
- An exception handling block is added to handle potential errors when requesting the tunnel, allowing you to handle and log the errors appropriately.
