The error occurs when the `requestTunnel` function is called. This function opens a tunnel to the proxy using the `CONNECT` method. The error message indicates that there is a type error, specifically: "Data must not be unicode."

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the `write` method is being passed Unicode data instead of bytes. This is likely causing a type error when trying to write the tunnel request to the transport.

To fix this bug, you can encode the `tunnelReq` variable to bytes using the UTF-8 encoding before writing it to the transport.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost, self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    tunnelReq_bytes = tunnelReq.encode('utf-8')  # Convert to bytes
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq_bytes)
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```

By encoding `tunnelReq` to bytes using UTF-8 encoding, we ensure that it is sent as bytes to the transport, preventing the "Data must not be unicode" error.
