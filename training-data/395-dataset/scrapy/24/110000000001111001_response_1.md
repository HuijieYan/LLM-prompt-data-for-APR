The potential error is occurring at the line `protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)` because the `protocol` object does not have a `transport` attribute.

The reason behind the bug is that the `protocol` object passed to the `requestTunnel` function is expected to have a `transport` attribute, but in this case, it does not. This could be due to the incorrect type of protocol object being passed or some other issue.

To fix this bug, we need to make sure that the correct protocol object with a `transport` attribute is passed to the function. Additionally, we should consider handling the case where the protocol object does not have a `transport` attribute, possibly by raising an error or returning None.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    if hasattr(protocol, 'transport'):
        tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost, self._tunneledPort)
        if self._proxyAuthHeader:
            tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
        tunnelReq += '\r\n'
        protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)
        self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
        protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
        self._protocol = protocol
        return protocol
    else:
        print("Protocol object does not have a transport attribute")
        return None
```
