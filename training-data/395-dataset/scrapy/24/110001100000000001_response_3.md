The potential error in the provided function is related to the way the `processProxyResponse` function is being assigned to the `protocol.dataReceived`. It seems like the intention is to temporarily replace the `protocol.dataReceived` with `processProxyResponse` and then restore it later. However, the current implementation does not properly restore the original `dataReceived` function.

To fix this bug, we can store the original `dataReceived` function before replacing it with `processProxyResponse`, and then restore it after the `tunnelReq` is sent.

Here's the corrected code for the `requestTunnel` function:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    def restoreDataReceived():
        protocol.dataReceived = self._protocolDataReceived
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost, self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    reactor.callLater(0, restoreDataReceived)  # Restore original dataReceived later
    return protocol
```

In the corrected code, we first define a `restoreDataReceived` function that restores the original `dataReceived` function. After sending the `tunnelReq`, we use `reactor.callLater` to schedule the `restoreDataReceived` function to be called later, ensuring that the original `dataReceived` is properly restored.
