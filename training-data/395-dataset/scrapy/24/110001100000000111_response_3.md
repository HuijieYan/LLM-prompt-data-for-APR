Potential Error:
The potential error in the code is that the `processProxyResponse` function is being called without the required `self` parameter.

Reason for the Bug:
The `processProxyResponse` function is a method of the class, and it requires the `self` parameter to be passed when called. However, in the current code, it is being called without `self`, which leads to a TypeError.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `self` parameter is passed when calling the `processProxyResponse` function. We also need to ensure that the function itself has the correct signature.

Corrected Code:
```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost, self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol

def processProxyResponse(self, bytes):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def dataReceived(self, bodyBytes):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass
```
