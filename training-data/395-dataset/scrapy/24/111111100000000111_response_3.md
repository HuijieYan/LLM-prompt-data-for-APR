Potential error location: 

The error occurs in the `requestTunnel` function where the `protocol.dataReceived` attribute is being reassigned with `self.processProxyResponse`.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:

The bug occurs because when `protocol.dataReceived` is reassigned to `self.processProxyResponse`, any subsequent data received by the `protocol` will be handled by `self.processProxyResponse` instead of the original `protocol.dataReceived` method. This can lead to unexpected behavior in the handling of the `protocol` data.

Approaches for fixing the bug:

To fix the bug, we need to preserve the original `protocol.dataReceived` method and reassign it back after sending the tunnel request. This can be done by saving the original `protocol.dataReceived` method before reassigning it and then restoring it afterwards. 

Additionally, it's good practice to use `try/finally` block to ensure that the original `protocol.dataReceived` method is always restored, even if an exception occurs.

Corrected code:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
        """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
        tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost, self._tunneledPort)
        if self._proxyAuthHeader:
            tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
        tunnelReq += '\r\n'

        original_data_received = protocol.dataReceived

        try:
            protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)
            self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
            protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
            self._protocol = protocol
            return protocol
        finally:
            protocol.dataReceived = original_data_received
```
This code saves the original `protocol.dataReceived` method in `original_data_received`, reassigns it to `self.processProxyResponse` while sending the tunnel request, and then restores it in a `try/finally` block to ensure it always gets restored.
