The buggy function `requestTunnel` seems to be causing an issue that ultimately results in a `Unicode` data type error. The function tries to write the `tunnelReq` byte string to the `protocol.transport`, which causes the error.

The reason behind this bug occurring is that the function doesn't handle encoding issues properly while writing to the transport. It directly concatenates `bytes` and `str` types, leading to the encoding mismatch.

To fix this bug, we should ensure that the `tunnelReq` byte string is encoded correctly, and then write it to the transport. This can be achieved using `tunnelReq.encode('utf-8')` to convert `tunnelReq` to a byte string with UTF-8 encoding.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost.decode('utf-8'),
                                              self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq.encode('utf-8'))
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```
