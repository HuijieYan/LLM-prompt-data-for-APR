The potential error location within the `requestTunnel` function is the assignment of `protocol.dataReceived` to `self.processProxyResponse`, which overwrites the original `dataReceived` function of the `protocol`.

The bug occurs because the `dataReceived` function for the `protocol` is being replaced with the `processProxyResponse` function. This will cause issues with handling data received from the protocol, as it is no longer using the original `dataReceived` function.

To fix the bug, the original `dataReceived` function of the `protocol` needs to be preserved and restored after the `processProxyResponse` function has been used. This can be done by saving the original `dataReceived` function before it is replaced, and then restoring it when necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the `requestTunnel` function:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost, self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    
    original_dataReceived = protocol.dataReceived  # Save the original dataReceived function
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)
    self._protocolDataReceived = original_dataReceived  # Save the original dataReceived function
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    
    # Define a function to restore the original dataReceived function
    def restoreDataReceived():
        protocol.dataReceived = original_dataReceived

    # Return the protocol and the restore function
    return protocol, restoreDataReceived
```

This corrected code saves the original `dataReceived` function, replaces it with `processProxyResponse`, and returns the protocol along with a function to restore the original `dataReceived` function when it is needed.
