The error message indicates that the data being written is of type unicode, which is causing a TypeError. This error occurs within the `requestTunnel` method of the class `TunnelingTCP4ClientEndpoint`. 

The reason behind this bug is that the data being written to the transport is expected to be of type bytes, but it is of type unicode instead, which causes a TypeError when trying to write it.

To fix this bug, the unicode data should be encoded to bytes before writing it to the transport.

Here's the corrected code for the `requestTunnel` method:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost, self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq.encode('utf-8'))  # Encode unicode to bytes before writing
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```

In the corrected code, the `tunnelReq` is encoded to bytes using the `encode('utf-8')` method before writing it to the protocol's transport. This ensures that the data being written is of type bytes, thereby resolving the TypeError.
