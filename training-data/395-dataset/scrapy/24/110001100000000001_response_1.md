The potential error in the function `requestTunnel` is that `protocol.dataReceived` is being assigned the value of `self.processProxyResponse` without saving a reference to the original `protocol.dataReceived` function. This means that if `self.processProxyResponse` is ever removed or changed, it won't be possible to revert back to the original `protocol.dataReceived` function.

To fix this, we should save a reference to the original `protocol.dataReceived` function before assigning `self.processProxyResponse` to it. Then, we can assign the new value and later use the saved reference if needed.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost,
                                              self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)
    
    # Save reference to the original dataReceived function
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    
    # Assign the new function to dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    
    # Save the reference to the protocol
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```

With this change, we have saved the original `protocol.dataReceived` function and can revert back to it if needed.
