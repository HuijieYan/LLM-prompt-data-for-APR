The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` related to data being unicode. This error happens when the `requestTunnel` function tries to write data to the connection transport. It suggests that the data being written is unicode, which is not acceptable in that context.

To fix this issue, the `tunnelReq` string should be encoded to bytes before writing it to the transport. This can be done using the `encode` method in Python.

Here's the corrected code for the `requestTunnel` function:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = f'CONNECT {self._tunneledHost}:{self._tunneledPort} HTTP/1.1\r\n'
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += f'Proxy-Authorization: {self._proxyAuthHeader}\r\n'
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq.encode())
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
``` 

By using the `encode()` method on the `tunnelReq` string, it is converted to bytes, ensuring that the data being written to the transport is in the correct format and preventing the `TypeError` related to unicode data.
