Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the line `protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)` as it could potentially produce an error related to writing to a transport that may be unavailable or not properly set up.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug may occur because the `protocol` object may not have a valid `transport` attribute, leading to an AttributeError. This can happen if the `protocol` has not been properly initialized or if the connection has not been established.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Verify that the `protocol` object has a valid `transport` attribute before attempting to write to it.
2. Ensure that the `protocol` object is properly initialized with a valid transport before calling the `requestTunnel` method.
3. Handle the possibility of an invalid or missing transport attribute gracefully within the `requestTunnel` method by adding error checking and appropriate error handling.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    if protocol.transport:
        tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost,
                                                  self._tunneledPort)
        if self._proxyAuthHeader:
            tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
        tunnelReq += '\r\n'
        protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)
        self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
        protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
        self._protocol = protocol
        return protocol
    else:
        # Handle the case where the protocol's transport is not available
        # This could involve logging an error, raising an exception, or taking other appropriate action
        return None
```
