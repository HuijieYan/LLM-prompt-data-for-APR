The test case 'test_download_with_proxy_https_timeout' is using the 'download_request' function to make a request with a proxy and a specified download timeout. The error message indicates a TypeError related to data being unicode, which suggests that the issue may be with the request or response data being handled or processed incorrectly.

The function 'requestTunnel' is the source of the error. This function is used to ask the proxy to open a tunnel. The bug occurs in this function when handling the response from the proxy server.

The reason behind the bug is that when assigning the 'processProxyResponse' method to 'protocol.dataReceived', the reference to 'self.processProxyResponse' method is lost, which causes the TypeError when 'self' attributes are accessed within 'processProxyResponse'.

To fix this bug, the 'processProxyResponse' method should be bound to the 'requestTunnel' instance. This can be achieved using the 'functools.partial' method to create a bound method and assign it to 'protocol.dataReceived'.

Here's the corrected code for the 'requestTunnel' function:

```python
import functools

def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost,
                                                self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)

    # Bind the processProxyResponse method to the instance
    process_proxy_response_bound = functools.partial(self.processProxyResponse, self)
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived

    # Assign the bound method to protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = process_proxy_response_bound

    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```

By binding the 'processProxyResponse' method to the instance using the 'functools.partial' method, the bug is fixed as the 'self' reference will be correctly passed to 'processProxyResponse' even after it's assigned to 'protocol.dataReceived'.
