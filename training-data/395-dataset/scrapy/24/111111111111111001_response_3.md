The error message suggests that the issue lies in the `requestTunnel` function of the `TunnelingTCP4ClientEndpoint` class, specifically in the `protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)` line, which is consistent with the observation that the failure is related to writing data.

The bug occurs because the function `requestTunnel` is not handling unicode data properly. It seems to be treating unicode data as bytes, leading to a `TypeError` when writing data over the transport.

To fix this bug, you should make sure that `tunnelReq` is encoded properly so that it can be written to the transport. You can encode `tunnelReq` to bytes using the correct encoding (e.g., UTF-8) before writing it to the transport.

Here's the corrected code for the `requestTunnel` function:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost.decode('utf-8'), self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    encodedReq = tunnelReq.encode('utf-8')  # Encode to bytes using UTF-8 encoding
    protocol.transport.write(encodedReq)
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```

In this corrected code, `tunnelReq` is encoded to bytes using the UTF-8 encoding before writing it to the transport. This ensures that the data is properly handled and avoids the `TypeError` related to unicode data.
