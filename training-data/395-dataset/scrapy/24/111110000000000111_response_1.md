Potential Error Location:
The potential error is in the `requestTunnel` function where the `protocol.dataReceived` is being assigned to `self.processProxyResponse`. This will overwrite the `protocol.dataReceived` with `self.processProxyResponse` and might result in unexpected behavior.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug is occurring because the `processProxyResponse` function is being assigned to `protocol.dataReceived` which might not be the intended behavior. This can lead to issues with the processing of data received by the protocol.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we can create a wrapper function that combines the functionality of both `processProxyResponse` and the original `protocol.dataReceived` function. This way, both functions can be called in the correct sequence without overwriting each other.

Corrected Code:
```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost, self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'

    def combinedDataReceived(data):
        self.processProxyResponse(data)
        protocol.dataReceived(data)

    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)
    protocol.dataReceived = combinedDataReceived
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```
