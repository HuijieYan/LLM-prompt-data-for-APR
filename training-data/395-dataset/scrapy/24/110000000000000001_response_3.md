Potential error location: The error might be caused by the usage of 'self._protocolDataReceived' and 'self._protocol' without their corresponding definitions in the provided code.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The variables 'self._protocolDataReceived' and 'self._protocol' are used without being defined or initialized in the code, which can cause unexpected behavior or errors.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Define and initialize the variables 'self._protocolDataReceived' and 'self._protocol' before using them in the function.
2. Ensure that the 'protocol' argument passed to the function has the necessary attributes and methods, or handle potential errors if they are missing.

Corrected code:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost,
                                              self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```
In the corrected code, I have assumed that 'self._tunneledHost', 'self._tunneledPort', and 'self._proxyAuthHeader' are defined elsewhere in the class, and therefore, I have focused on initializing and using 'self._protocolDataReceived' and 'self._protocol' correctly within the 'requestTunnel' function.
