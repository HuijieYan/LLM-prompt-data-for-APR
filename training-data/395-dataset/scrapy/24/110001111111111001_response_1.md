The error message indicates a `TypeError` with the message "Data must not be unicode" which is raised during the execution of the `requestTunnel` function. The issue likely arises from incorrectly handling the request to open a tunnel when using a proxy.

The `requestTunnel` function is responsible for sending a request to open a tunnel through a proxy. The buggy implementation might be causing this function to incorrectly handle the protocol's data, resulting in an unexpected `Unicode` data type being received.

To address this issue, the handling of the protocol's data and the conversion of data types should be reviewed. It's important to ensure that the correct data type, usually `bytes`, is being used and handled consistently throughout the function's logic.

Here's the corrected implementation of the `requestTunnel` function:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = b'CONNECT {}:{} HTTP/1.1\r\n'.format(self._tunneledHost.decode(), self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += b'Proxy-Authorization: {}\r\n'.format(self._proxyAuthHeader)
    tunnelReq += b'\r\n'
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```

In the corrected implementation:
- The `tunnelReq` is explicitly encoded as `bytes` using the `b` prefix.
- When using `self._tunneledHost` in the `tunnelReq`, it should be decoded to a string unless it's sure that it's already a string.
- The format of `tunnelReq` is modified to use the `b` prefix and format the strings as `bytes`.
- This ensures that all involved data types are consistent and handled correctly.
