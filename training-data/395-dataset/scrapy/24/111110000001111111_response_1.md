The potential error in the `requestTunnel` function is that the `protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)` line is attempting to write to the transport before checking if the connection is actually established. This can lead to a race condition where the write occurs before the connection is fully established, causing unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that we only send the `tunnelReq` once the connection is established. We can achieve this by using `protocol.makeConnection` and `protocol.connectionMade` to handle the connection setup.

Here's the corrected code for the `requestTunnel` function:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    def _sendTunnelRequest():
        tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost, self._tunneledPort)
        if self._proxyAuthHeader:
            tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
        tunnelReq += '\r\n'
        protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)
        self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
        protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
        self._protocol = protocol

    if protocol.transport and protocol.transport.connector and protocol.transport.connector.state == "connected":
        _sendTunnelRequest()
    else:
        protocol.makeConnection(protocol.transport)
        protocol.connectionMade = lambda: (protocol.connectionMade(), _sendTunnelRequest())

    return protocol
```

With this change, we're checking if the connection is already established before sending the tunnel request. If the connection is not yet established, we set up a callback to send the tunnel request once the connection is made. This will ensure that the tunnel request is sent at the appropriate time, avoiding the race condition and potential bugs.
