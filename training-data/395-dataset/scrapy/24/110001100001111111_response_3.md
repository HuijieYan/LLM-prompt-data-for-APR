The error seems to be in the `requestTunnel` function, which is responsible for sending a tunnel request to the proxy server. The bug occurs when trying to write the tunnel request to the protocol's transport using `protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)`. This can cause issues such as corrupted data being sent to the server or the request not being sent at all.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the tunnel request is sent properly and that the protocol's dataReceived method is overridden with `self.processProxyResponse`. 

Here's the corrected code for the `requestTunnel` function:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost.decode('utf-8'),
                                                   self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq = 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader + tunnelReq
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq.encode('utf-8'))
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```

In the corrected code, the `tunnelReq` variable is properly encoded before sending it using `protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)`. Additionally, the method `decode('utf-8')` is used to handle the bytes data for `self._tunneledHost`. The `tunnelReq` string is also properly concatenated with the `Proxy-Authorization` header if it exists.

These changes should address the issue and ensure that the tunnel request is sent correctly and that the protocol's `dataReceived` method is overridden as intended.
