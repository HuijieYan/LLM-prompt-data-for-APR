The potential error in the provided function is that it attempts to access the `transport` attribute of the `protocol` object, but it is not explicitly defined in the function or passed as an argument.

The error message that could be associated with this issue is something like "AttributeError: 'Protocol' object has no attribute 'transport'."

To fix this issue, you can modify the function to explicitly accept the `transport` parameter and use it to access the `write` method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol, transport):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost,
                                              self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    transport.write(tunnelReq)
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```

In this corrected code, the `transport` parameter is added to the function signature and used to call the `write` method, fixing the issue of accessing the `transport` attribute directly from the `protocol` object.
