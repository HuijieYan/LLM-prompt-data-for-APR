Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the `requestTunnel` function, specifically in how the `tunnelReq` variable is being constructed and used, as well as how the `protocol.dataReceived` function is being modified.

Reason for the bug: The `tunnelReq` variable is being incorrectly constructed, and the way the `protocol.dataReceived` function is being modified could be causing the bug.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: The `tunnelReq` variable should be constructed in a way that represents a valid HTTP request. Additionally, the modification of `protocol.dataReceived` should be handled carefully to ensure it doesn't cause unintended side effects.

Corrected code:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost.decode('utf-8'), self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq = 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n%s' % (self._proxyAuthHeader, tunnelReq)
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq.encode('utf-8'))
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```

In the corrected code:
1. The `tunnelReq` variable is constructed using byte strings and encoded to UTF-8 for compatibility with the `write` method.
2. The `Proxy-Authorization` header is properly formatted.
3. The `dataReceived` method is assigned the `processProxyResponse` function without overwriting the original `dataReceived` method.
