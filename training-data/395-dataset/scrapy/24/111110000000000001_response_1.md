The potential error in the `requestTunnel` function is that it is setting `protocol.dataReceived` to `self.processProxyResponse` without properly saving the original `dataReceived` method. This means that the original `dataReceived` method is not being preserved and could lead to unexpected behavior.

The reason behind this bug is that the original `protocol.dataReceived` method needs to be preserved in case it is needed later.

To fix this bug, we can save the original `dataReceived` method before setting it to `self.processProxyResponse`, and then restore it when needed.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
# this is the corrected function
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost,
                                              self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    
    original_data_received = protocol.dataReceived  # save the original dataReceived method
    def new_data_received(bytes):
        self.processProxyResponse(bytes)
    protocol.dataReceived = new_data_received  # set the new dataReceived method

    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```
