Potential error location: The error may be occurring in the `requestTunnel` function, specifically in the line `protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)`. 

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug may be caused by the `protocol.transport` not being available or not properly configured to handle the `write` method.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the `protocol.transport` is properly initialized and if it has the `write` method available.
2. Ensure that the `protocol.transport` is connected and ready to send data.

Corrected code for the `requestTunnel` function:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = b'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost, self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += b'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```
In the corrected code, we have added `b` in front of the string literals to make sure they are treated as bytes. Additionally, we added an extra `\r\n` at the end of the `tunnelReq` to properly indicate the end of the HTTP header.
