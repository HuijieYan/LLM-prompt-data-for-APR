The potential error in the function 'requestTunnel' is that it is trying to assign a method to 'protocol.dataReceived', but it should actually first unbind the existing method before doing so.

The error occurs because the method 'processProxyResponse' is being assigned to 'protocol.dataReceived' without unbinding the existing method first. This can cause unexpected behavior as both methods might get called when 'dataReceived' is triggered.

To fix this, we need to unbind the existing method from 'protocol.dataReceived' before assigning 'processProxyResponse' to it.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost, self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```
