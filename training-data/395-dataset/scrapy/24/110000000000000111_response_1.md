Potential error location: The potential error is located in the line `protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)`. This line tries to access the `transport` attribute of the `protocol` object, which may not be available or may not be implemented in the `protocol` class.

Reasons behind the bug: The error may occur because the `protocol` object does not have a `transport` attribute, or it may not have the `write` method.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We can modify the `requestTunnel` function to accept a `transport` parameter, which will be used to write the `tunnelReq` data. Additionally, we can check if the `protocol` object has a `transport` attribute before trying to access it.

Corrected code:
```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol, transport):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost, self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    transport.write(tunnelReq)
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```
