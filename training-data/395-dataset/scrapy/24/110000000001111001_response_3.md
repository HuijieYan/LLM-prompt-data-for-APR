The potential error location within the function is at the line `protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)`. The error is occurring because the `protocol.transport` attribute does not have a `write` method, which is causing the function to fail.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `protocol` object does not have a `transport` attribute with a `write` method, which is necessary for sending the tunnel request.

To fix the bug, we need to use the `write()` method of the transport attribute of `protocol`, which is obtained by calling `get_info()` method on the `protocol`. Then, we can use the transport's write method to send the tunnel request.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost, self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'
    transport = protocol.get_info('transport')
    transport.write(tunnelReq)
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```
