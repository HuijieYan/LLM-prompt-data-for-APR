The error message indicates a `TypeError` related to the data being unicode, which suggests that the bug is likely to be located in the `requestTunnel` function. Specifically, the bug is probably caused by the way the `tunnelReq` is being constructed and sent.

The issue arises because the `tunnelReq` is being formatted using the `%` operator. In Python 3, the `%` operator is used for string formatting, and the use of `%s` may cause issues related to Unicode strings.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the way the `tunnelReq` is constructed and sent. We can use string concatenation instead of the `%` operator to prevent the Unicode-related issues.

Here's the corrected code for the `requestTunnel` function:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
        """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
        tunnelReq = 'CONNECT ' + str(self._tunneledHost) + ':' + str(self._tunneledPort) + ' HTTP/1.1\r\n'
        if self._proxyAuthHeader:
            tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: ' + str(self._proxyAuthHeader) + '\r\n'
        tunnelReq += '\r\n'
        protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq.encode('utf-8'))
        self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
        protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
        self._protocol = protocol
        return protocol
```

In the corrected code, we have used string concatenation to construct the `tunnelReq` and also encode the string using `utf-8` before writing it to the transport. This should resolve the `TypeError` related to Unicode strings.
