The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` related to handling unicode data in the `requestTunnel` function of the `TunnelingTCP4ClientEndpoint` class, specifically when attempting to write to the protocol's transport.

The bug is likely occurring because the function is trying to write unicode data to the protocol's transport, which expects bytes. This is causing a `TypeError` and leading to the failure in the test case.

To fix this, the function needs to encode the `tunnelReq` string into bytes before writing it to the protocol's transport.

Here's the corrected code for the `requestTunnel` function:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    """Asks the proxy to open a tunnel."""
    tunnelReq = ('CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost,
                                                 self._tunneledPort)).encode('utf-8')
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += ('Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader).encode('utf-8')
    tunnelReq += b'\r\n'
    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```

By encoding the `tunnelReq` string into bytes before writing it to the protocol's transport, we ensure that the correct data type is being passed, which should resolve the `TypeError` and the failure in the test case.
