The error message indicates that the issue is within the `requestTunnel` method, specifically at the line `protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)`. The error is a `TypeError` stating "Data must not be unicode". This suggests that the `tunnelReq` might be of the wrong data type when trying to write it to the transport.

The bug occurs likely because `tunnelReq` is of the wrong data type. It is possibly stored as a Unicode string instead of a byte string, which is the appropriate data type for writing to the transport.

One approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that `tunnelReq` is encoded as a byte string before it is written to the transport. This can be achieved using the `encode()` method to convert the string to bytes before writing it to the transport.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def requestTunnel(self, protocol):
    tunnelReq = 'CONNECT %s:%s HTTP/1.1\r\n' % (self._tunneledHost, self._tunneledPort)
    if self._proxyAuthHeader:
        tunnelReq += 'Proxy-Authorization: %s\r\n' % self._proxyAuthHeader
    tunnelReq += '\r\n'

    # Encode the string as bytes
    tunnelReq = tunnelReq.encode('utf-8')

    protocol.transport.write(tunnelReq)
    self._protocolDataReceived = protocol.dataReceived
    protocol.dataReceived = self.processProxyResponse
    self._protocol = protocol
    return protocol
```
