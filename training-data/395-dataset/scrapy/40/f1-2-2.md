# buggy class docstring

```text
The idea behind this exporter is to have a mechanism to serialize items
to built-in python types so any serialization library (like
json, msgpack, binc, etc) can be used on top of it. Its main goal is to
seamless support what BaseItemExporter does plus nested items.
