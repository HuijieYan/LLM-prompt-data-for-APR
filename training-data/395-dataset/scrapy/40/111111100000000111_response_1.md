The potential error in the given code is at the `_serialize_value` function. The function is supposed to serialize the value based on its type, but there are some issues with the `if` conditions.

The bug arises because the code is using `isinstance` to check if the value is an instance of `BaseItem`, but `BaseItem` is not defined anywhere in the provided code. Additionally, there is a missing implementation for the `is_listlike` function, which might also cause issues.

To fix the bug, the `BaseItem` class needs to be imported or defined, and the `is_listlike` function needs to be implemented or imported if it exists elsewhere.

Here's the corrected code for the `_serialize_value` function:

```python
def _serialize_value(self, value):
    if isinstance(value, dict):
        return {k: self._serialize_value(v) for k, v in value.items()}
    elif isinstance(value, (list, tuple)):
        return [self._serialize_value(v) for v in value]
    elif self.binary:
        return to_bytes(value, encoding=self.encoding)
    else:
        return to_unicode(value, encoding=self.encoding)
```

In this corrected code, the `isinstance` check is modified to handle dictionaries, lists, and tuples properly. The code then recursively calls itself to serialize nested values. Additionally, the `is_listlike` check is removed and replaced with a check for lists and tuples directly.
