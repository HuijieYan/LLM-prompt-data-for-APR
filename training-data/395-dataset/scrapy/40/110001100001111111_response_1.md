The issue with the given function is that the conditional statements for different data types are not mutually exclusive. As a result, the function can return multiple types of output depending on the input, which can lead to unexpected behavior. Additionally, the function `_serialize_value` is nested within the `export_item` method, which doesn't seem logically correct based on the function name.

To fix the function:
1. Rearrange the logic to make sure that the conditionals are mutually exclusive and that only one type of value is returned.
2. Move the `_serialize_value` function outside of the `export_item` method and make it a standalone function, as it seems to be a separate utility function.
3. Improve code readability by following PEP 8 styling guidelines (e.g., includes proper spacing and indentation).

Here's the corrected code for the `_serialize_value` function:

```python
def _serialize_value(self, value):
    if isinstance(value, BaseItem):
        return PythonItemExporter.export_item(self, value)
    elif isinstance(value, dict):
        return {k: self._serialize_value(v) for k, v in value.items()}
    elif is_listlike(value):
        return [self._serialize_value(v) for v in value]
    elif self.binary:
        return to_bytes(str(value), encoding=self.encoding)
    else:
        return to_unicode(str(value), encoding=self.encoding)
```

In this corrected code, the if-elif-else conditional statements ensure that only one type of value is returned based on the input. The function `_serialize_value` is now a standalone function and has been modified to handle the different data types properly.
