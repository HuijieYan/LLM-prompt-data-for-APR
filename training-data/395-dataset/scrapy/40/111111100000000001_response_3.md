The potential error in the provided code is in the _serialize_value function. The function checks the type of the 'value' parameter and then attempts to perform an action based on the type. However, the function is not properly structured to handle all possible types of 'value'.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the 'value' parameter properly. It is missing a check for list-like types and does not handle non-list non-dict types effectively.

To fix the bug, we need to update the _serialize_value function to properly handle all types of values. We also need to update the export_item function to ensure it is properly implemented.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class PythonItemExporter(BaseItemExporter):
    """
    The idea behind this exporter is to have a mechanism to serialize items
    to built-in python types so any serialization library (like
    json, msgpack, binc, etc) can be used on top of it. Its main goal is to
    seamless support what BaseItemExporter does plus nested items.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def _serialize_value(self, value):
        if isinstance(value, BaseItem):
            return self.export_item(value)
        elif isinstance(value, dict):
            return {key: self._serialize_value(val) for key, val in value.items()}
        elif is_listlike(value):
            return [self._serialize_value(v) for v in value]
        elif self.binary:
            return to_bytes(value, encoding=self.encoding)
        else:
            return to_unicode(value, encoding=self.encoding)
            
    def export_item(self, item):
        # implementation goes here
        pass
```

In the corrected code:
- In the _serialize_value function, we have added an elif block for dict type to properly serialize dictionary values. We also updated the is_listlike check, and added an else block to handle non-list non-dict types.
- We have also included the export_item function with the placeholder "implementation goes here" as it was not provided in the original code.
