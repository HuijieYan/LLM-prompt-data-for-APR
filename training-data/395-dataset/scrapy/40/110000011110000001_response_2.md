The error occurs when the `export_item` method is called within the `test_other_python_types_item` test function. The error message indicates that the `to_unicode` function is being passed a boolean value, which it does not support.

The potential error location within the `_serialize_value` method is the `else` statement at the end of the function, where `to_unicode` is being called. This is where the boolean value is being incorrectly passed to the `to_unicode` function.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `else` statement is being triggered for boolean values, which should not be happening. The function should handle boolean values differently.

To fix the bug, we need to check for boolean values before attempting to convert them to unicode. We also need to use a different approach to handle boolean values and return them as required without attempting to convert them to unicode.

Here's the corrected code for the `_serialize_value` method:

```python
def _serialize_value(self, value):
    if isinstance(value, BaseItem):
        return self.export_item(value)
    if isinstance(value, dict):
        return dict(self._serialize_dict(value))
    if is_listlike(value):
        return [self._serialize_value(v) for v in value]
    if self.binary:
        return to_bytes(value, encoding=self.encoding)
    if isinstance(value, bool):
        return str(value)  # Convert boolean values to strings
    return to_unicode(value, encoding=self.encoding)  # For other non-boolean values
```
