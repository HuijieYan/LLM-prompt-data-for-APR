Potential error location: The error is occurring when creating the `MyItem` class using `six.with_metaclass(ItemMeta, Item)`. This error indicates that the metaclass `ItemMeta` is not handling the class creation correctly, resulting in a `TypeError` related to the class cell propagation requirement.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The buggy function is not handling the metaclass creation and inheritance correctly, leading to issues in class cell propagation.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the metaclass `ItemMeta` handles the class creation and inheritance properly.
2. Check the implementation of `six` and `ItemMeta` to see if there are any conflicts or issues that may be causing the error.
3. Ensure that the metaclass `ItemMeta` correctly handles the class cell propagation requirement when creating new classes.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super().__new__(mcs, class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for n, v in attrs.items():
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        else:
            new_attrs[n] = v

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super().__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, bases, new_attrs)

# Note: Assuming that the super().__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, bases, new_attrs) line is properly handling the metaclass creation requirements.
```
