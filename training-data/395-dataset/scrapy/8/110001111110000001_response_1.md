Potential error location: The original function `__new__` is creating a new class with modified attributes but is not inheriting from the correct base class.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug may be occurring because the new class is not correctly inheriting from the base class, which results in the error message when the test case is executed.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: The `__new__` function should correctly inherit from the base class to avoid the TypeError. Additionally, the function should correctly update the class attributes as intended.

Corrected code:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    new_attrs = attrs.copy()

    for base in bases:
        if hasattr(base, 'fields'):
            if 'fields' not in new_attrs:
                new_attrs['fields'] = {}
            new_attrs['fields'].update(base.fields)

    _class = super().__new__(mcs, class_name, new_bases, new_attrs)
    _class.fields.update((name, value) for name, value in new_attrs.items() if isinstance(value, Field))

    return _class
```
