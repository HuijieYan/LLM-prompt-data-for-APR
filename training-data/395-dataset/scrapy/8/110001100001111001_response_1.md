The buggy function seems to be intended to create a new class with certain attributes based on the input parameters. The error is likely to be caused by incorrect use of the `super()` function and incorrect variable naming.

One potential error location in the buggy code is using `ItemMeta` as the first argument to the `super()` function instead of `mcs`. This could lead to a recursion issue.

The cause of the bug is that the `super()` function is not being called correctly, and there may be a confusion between different classes due to the inconsistent variable naming.

To fix the bug, the following steps can be taken:
1. Call the `super()` function properly, using `mcs` as the first argument instead of `ItemMeta`.
2. Use consistent variable naming to avoid confusion.
3. Use nested `if` blocks to avoid recursion issues.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# relative function's signature in this file
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super().__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super().__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```
