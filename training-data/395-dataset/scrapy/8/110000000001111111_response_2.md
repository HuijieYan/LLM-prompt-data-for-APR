The bug seems to be occurring in the overridden `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` class. It is trying to create a new class by filtering and adding attributes, but it appears to be doing so incorrectly.

The bug occurs because when creating the new class, it passes modified attributes back to the `__new__` method, resulting in an infinite loop. This causes a `TypeError` when the `__class__` attribute is set.

To fix this, we can modify the method to correctly filter and add attributes, and then call the base class method to create the new class.

Here's the corrected `__new__` method:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super().__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
    new_attrs = {}
    for n, v in attrs.items():
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        else:
            new_attrs[n] = v

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super().__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

With this correction, the method should no longer result in an infinite loop and the `__class__` attribute should be set correctly, resolving the `TypeError` issue.
