The bug is occurring in the `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` class. The `__new__` method is intended to create a new instance of the class, but the implementation in the buggy code is incorrect and causing the TypeError.

The error message suggests that there is an issue with setting the '__class__' attribute, and this is likely related to the incorrect implementation of the `__new__` method.

The `__new__` method should be modified to properly handle the creation of a new class instance, including setting the correct attributes such as '__class__'.

One possible approach to fixing the bug could be to modify the `__new__` method to create a new class instance with the correct attributes and handle inheritance properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` method:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super().__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in attrs:
        v = attrs[n]
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        else:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super().__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

This corrected code properly handles the creation of a new class instance, sets the correct attributes, and handles inheritance as expected.
