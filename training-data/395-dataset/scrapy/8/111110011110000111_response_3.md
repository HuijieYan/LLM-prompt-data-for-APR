1. The test case is attempting to create a class `MyItem` that inherits from `Item` using `six.with_metaclass(ItemMeta, Item)`. However, it is resulting in a TypeError related to the __class__.

2. The potential error location is within the `ItemMeta` class and specifically in the `__new__` method, where the new class is being created.

3. The bug occurs because the `ItemMeta` class is not properly handling the creation of the new class when inheritance is involved. This results in the incorrect handling of the __class__ attribute, leading to the TypeError.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include properly handling the creation of the new class, ensuring that inheritance is handled correctly, and not causing issues with the __class__ attribute.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class ItemMeta(ABCMeta):
    def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
        new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
        _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

        fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
        new_attrs = {}
        for n in dir(_class):
            v = getattr(_class, n)
            if isinstance(v, Field):
                fields[n] = v
            elif n in attrs:
                new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

        new_attrs['fields'] = fields
        new_attrs['_class'] = _class
        return type.__new__(mcs, class_name, tuple(bases), new_attrs)
```
In the corrected code, the usage of super() has been replaced with type.__new__ to properly create the new class when inheritance is involved. This should fix the TypeError and ensure that class creation and inheritance are handled correctly.
