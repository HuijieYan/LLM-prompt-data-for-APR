Potential error location: The problematic function seems to be the `__new__` method of the ItemMeta metaclass.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug seems to be related to the incorrect usage of the `__new__` method for creating new classes and propagating class cell. The current implementation does not handle class cell properly, which leads to the `TypeError` in the test function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the metaclass `__new__` method to properly create the new class with the updated attributes and bases.
2. Ensure that class cell propagation is handled correctly within the `__new__` method.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    new_attrs = {}
    fields = {}

    for name, value in attrs.items():
        if isinstance(value, Field):
            fields[name] = value
        else:
            new_attrs[name] = value

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = None
    
    # Create a new class with updated attributes and bases
    new_class = super().__new__(mcs, class_name, new_bases, new_attrs)
    new_class.fields = fields
    new_class._class = new_class

    return new_class
```

In the corrected code:
- The new class is created using `super().__new__` with the updated attributes and bases.
- The class cell is assigned to the new class after its creation.
- The attributes are properly separated into fields and other attributes.
