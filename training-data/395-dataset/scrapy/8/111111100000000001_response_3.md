The potential error in the given function is that it is trying to call the `__new__` method of the superclass `ItemMeta` using the `mcs` class. However, it is also modifying the `attrs` parameter before calling the superclass's `__new__` method.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the function is modifying the `attrs` parameter before calling the superclass's `__new__` method, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to first create a modified `attrs` dictionary before calling the superclass's `__new__` method, and then use this modified dictionary to create the new class.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, new_attrs)
```
