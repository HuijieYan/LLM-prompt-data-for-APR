The potential error in the provided code lies in the `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` class. The issue seems to be with the redefinition of the `__new__` method and the incorrect usage of the `super()` function.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `__new__` method is being overridden in a way that is not preserving the intended functionality of the method.

To fix the bug, the corrected code for the `__new__` method is provided below:

```python
class ItemMeta(ABCMeta):
    def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
        new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
        _class = super().__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

        fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
        new_attrs = {}
        for n in dir(_class):
            v = getattr(_class, n)
            if isinstance(v, Field):
                fields[n] = v
            elif n in attrs:
                new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

        new_attrs['fields'] = fields
        new_attrs['_class'] = _class
        return super().__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, new_attrs)
```

In the corrected code, `super()` is used without specifying the class name, as it automatically refers to the superclass of the current class. This ensures that the `__new__` method is properly overridden and the intended functionality is preserved.
