Based on the provided information, the issue seems to be with the `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` class. The `__new__` method creates a new class, and it appears to be incorrectly initializing the new class.

The issue may be caused by the creation of the new class (`_class`) within the `__new__` method, as well as the return statement at the end of the method. The `__new__` method should be used to create a new instance of a class, not to create a new class.

To fix the bug, you can modify the `__new__` method to properly handle the creation of a new class. Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` method:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super().__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in attrs:
        v = attrs[n]
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        else:
            new_attrs[n] = v

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return type(class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

In the corrected code, the `__new__` method correctly creates a new dictionary `new_attrs` that contains the attributes for the new class. Finally, the `type` function is used to create a new class based on the provided class name, bases, and attributes.

This should address the bug and resolve the issue with item inheritance failing in Python 3.6.
