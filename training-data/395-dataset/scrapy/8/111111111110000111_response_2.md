1. The test case `test_item_meta_classcell_regression` creates a class `MyItem` which inherits from `six.with_metaclass(ItemMeta, Item)` and then calls `super()` within its `__init__` method. The error message indicates that the `__class__` is being set to a different class than expected.

2. The potential error location is the `__new__` function within the `ItemMeta` class. This function is responsible for creating a new instance of the class. It seems that the code within this function is not handling class inheritance properly.

3. The error occurs because the `__new__` function is not correctly handling the creation of the new class (`_class`). It seems to be creating a new class with a modified name (`x_` + `class_name`) and then attempting to blend the attributes of the base class and the new class. This process is likely causing the new class to not inherit properly, resulting in the `__class__` error.

4. To fix the bug, the `__new__` function should create the new class (`_class`) without modifying the name, and then properly inherit the attributes from the base class and the new class.

5. Corrected code for the `__new__` function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base for base in bases if hasattr(base, 'fields'))
    new_class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, new_bases, attrs)
    
    fields = {}
    for base in new_bases:
        fields.update(getattr(base, 'fields', {}))
        
    for name, value in attrs.items():
        if isinstance(value, Field):
            fields[name] = value
            
    new_class.fields = fields
    
    return new_class
```
