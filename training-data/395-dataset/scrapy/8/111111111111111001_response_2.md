The error occurs when the `ItemMeta` metaclass is used in the `MyItem` class. The bug is in the `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` class. The bug occurs because the `new_attrs` dictionary overwrites the provided `attrs` dictionary when calling the superclass's `__new__` method for the second time. This causes the `__class__` of the `MyItem` class to be set incorrectly, leading to the `TypeError`.

To fix the bug, the `new_attrs` dictionary should be updated with the values from both `attrs` and the fields from the `_class` attribute. This way, the provided class attributes are retained, and the fields from the `_class` attribute are added to the `new_attrs` dictionary.

Here's the corrected `__new__` method for the `ItemMeta` class:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)
    
    fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
    new_attrs = dict(attrs)
    for base in bases:
        if hasattr(base, '_class'):
            for n in dir(base._class):
                v = getattr(base._class, n)
                if isinstance(v, Field):
                    fields[n] = v
    
    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

This corrected method fixes the bug by correctly updating the `new_attrs` dictionary with the values from `attrs` and the fields from the `_class` attribute. This ensures that the provided class attributes are preserved, and the fields from the `_class` attribute are added without overwriting the original attributes.
