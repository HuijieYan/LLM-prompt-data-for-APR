The error is likely occurring in the `ItemMeta` class. 

The error message indicates a `TypeError`, which suggests that there is a problem with the class definition of `MyItem` in the `test_item_meta_classcell_regression` test function. 

The issue seems to be related to the use of `six.with_metaclass` and the way the `ItemMeta` class is handling the creation of new classes.

The bug in the provided `ItemMeta` function is that it is not handling class creation correctly. The `__new__` method is trying to create a new class with the name 'x_' + class_name and the modified attributes. This is causing the `TypeError` because it's not taking into account the class cell propagation.

To fix the bug, the `__new__` method should be modified to correctly handle the class creation process using metaclasses.

Here's the corrected code for the `ItemMeta` class:

```python
class ItemMeta(type):
    def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
        new_bases = tuple(base for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
        _class = super().__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

        fields = {}
        new_attrs = {}
        for n, v in attrs.items():
            if isinstance(v, Field):
                fields[n] = v
            else:
                new_attrs[n] = v

        _class.fields = fields
        _class._class = _class
        return _class
```

This corrected `__new__` method correctly handles the class creation process by using `super().__new__` and modifying the `fields` and `attrs` appropriately. This should resolve the issue with class cell propagation and the `TypeError` described in the test function.
