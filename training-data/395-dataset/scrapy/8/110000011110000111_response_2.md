The error message indicates that the `MyItem` class is being defined as a local class, causing the `__class__` attribute to be set to the local class instead of the expected class.

The potential error within the problematic function is in the use of `super()` to instantiate the class. It seems that the `__new__` method is not correctly handling the class instantiation and inheritance.

The bug occurs because the `__new__` method is using the wrong arguments for instantiating the class. It should be using the `class_name` and `attrs` to create the new class instead of using the current `class_name` and `bases`.

To fix the bug, we need to correct the arguments used in the `super().__new__` call within the `__new__` method. Additionally, we also need to use the `class_name` and `attrs` to create the new class instead of the current `class_name` and `bases`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super().__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return type(class_name, (Item,), new_attrs)
```

With these changes, the `__new__` method should correctly instantiate the class and inherit from the appropriate bases.
