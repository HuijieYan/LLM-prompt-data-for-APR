The bug is located in the `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` class. The bug occurs because the `__new__` method tries to create a new class with modified bases and attributes, but it does not handle the `class_name` parameter properly, leading to errors when trying to create the new class.

The bug occurs because the `class_name` parameter is not used when creating the new class, causing the `TypeError` mentioned in the error message. The new class should be created using the modified `class_name` instead of the original one.

To fix the bug, the `__new__` method should use the modified `class_name` parameter when creating the new class. Additionally, the logic for handling bases and attributes should be carefully reviewed to ensure that it correctly constructs the new class.

Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` method:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, new_attrs)
```

In this corrected code, the `class_name` parameter is used to create the new class, and the bases and attributes are handled correctly. This should resolve the `TypeError` issue mentioned in the error message and make the `Item` inheritance work as expected.
