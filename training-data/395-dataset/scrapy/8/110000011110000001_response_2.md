Potential Error Location:
The error is occurring when the test function tries to create a new class `MyItem` using `six.with_metaclass(ItemMeta, Item)`. This indicates that the metaclass `ItemMeta` has a bug in its implementation.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug is likely occurring because the `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` metaclass is not handling the class creation process correctly. It seems to be missing the proper handling of class creation, leading to the error when creating a new class using `six.with_metaclass`.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that the `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` metaclass correctly handles the class creation process and inheritance from the base classes, including the proper handling of attributes and fields.

Corrected Code:
```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super().__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super().__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```
In the corrected code, the `super().__new__` method is invoked correctly to handle the class creation process and inheritance from the base classes. This should resolve the issue with the metaclass and allow the test function to execute without errors.
