Potential Error:
The potential error is in the overridden `__new__` method. The code is trying to create a new class by modifying the provided class attributes and bases, but it is not constructing the new class correctly.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `__new__` method is not constructing the new class with the correct attributes and bases. Additionally, the function is using the wrong class name and missing the correct ordering of parameters when calling the superclass `__new__` method.

Approach to Fix the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we are correctly constructing the new class with the modified attributes and bases. Additionally, we need to provide the correct parameters when calling the superclass `__new__` method.

Corrected Code:
```python
class ItemMeta(type):
    def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
        new_bases = tuple(base for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
        _class = super().__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

        fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
        new_attrs = {}
        for n in dir(_class):
            v = getattr(_class, n)
            if isinstance(v, Field):
                fields[n] = v
            elif n in attrs:
                new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

        new_attrs['fields'] = fields
        new_attrs['_class'] = _class
        return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```
