The issue occurs because the function is returning the wrong class. The `__new__` method of the metaclass `ItemMeta` is receiving the parameters `mcs, class_name, bases, attrs` in order to create a new class. However, the second `return` statement should be using the `_class` variable instead of calling `super()` to create the new class.

To fix the issue, the second `return` statement should be updated to use the `_class` variable instead of calling `super()` to create the new class. Below is the corrected code:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return _class
```
