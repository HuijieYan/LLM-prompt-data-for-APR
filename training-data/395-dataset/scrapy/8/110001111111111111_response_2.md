The issue is likely caused by the incorrect usage of the `super()` function in the `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` class. This causes the `TypeError` when using inheritance on the `Item`.

To fix the bug, the `super()` function should be used to call the `__new__` method from the parent class and pass the appropriate parameters. Additionally, it seems that the code is trying to handle attributes related to fields, so it's important to ensure that these attributes are properly handled and assigned to the new class.

Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` class:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_8/scrapy/item.py

def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = attrs.copy()

    for base in bases:
        fields.update(getattr(base, 'fields', {}))
    
    for n, v in attrs.items():
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return _class
```

In this corrected code, the attributes are properly handled and assigned to the new class. The `super()` function is used to call the `__new__` method from the parent class `mcs` with the correct parameters. This should resolve the `TypeError` issue when using inheritance on the `Item`.
