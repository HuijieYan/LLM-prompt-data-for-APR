The error message "TypeError: __class__ set to <class 'tests.test_item.ItemMetaClassCellRegression.test_item_meta_classcell_regression.<locals>.MyItem'> defining 'MyItem' as <class 'tests.test_item.MyItem'>" indicates that there is an issue with the class creation in the test function `test_item_meta_classcell_regression`. The function `__new__` in the `ItemMeta` class is likely the cause of the problem.

The bug occurs because in the `ItemMeta` class, when creating a new class, the metaclass's `__new__` method is not correctly handling the class creation process. Specifically, the class name is being modified before using it to call the parent metaclass's `__new__` method. This could potentially cause the type mismatch issue reported in the test case.

To fix the bug, we should correct the class name handling and ensure that the new class is created properly.

Here is the corrected `__new__` method:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    # Update fields and attributes
    fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return type(class_name, new_bases, new_attrs)
```

In the corrected code, the `class_name` is used directly to create the new class instead of modifying it before calling the parent metaclass's `__new__` method. This should address the issue reported in the test case.
