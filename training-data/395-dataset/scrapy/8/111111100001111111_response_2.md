The issue seems to be with the `__new__` method inside the `ItemMeta` class. The function is expected to create a new class based on the input parameters `class_name`, `bases`, and `attrs`, but the implementation is incorrect.

The bug occurs because the function is creating a new class without properly handling the inheritance and attribute merging. This results in the incorrect behavior seen in the test cases.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the inheritance and attribute merging when creating a new class. We can achieve this by using the `super` function to call the `__new__` method of the super class, and then merging the attributes accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` method inside the `ItemMeta` class:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    new_class = super().__new__(mcs, class_name, new_bases, attrs)
    
    fields = {}
    for base in bases:
        fields.update(getattr(base, 'fields', {}))
    
    fields.update({name: value for name, value in attrs.items() if isinstance(value, Field)})
    
    setattr(new_class, 'fields', fields)
    setattr(new_class, '_class', new_class)
    
    return new_class
```

In this corrected implementation, we properly handle the inheritance and attribute merging by using the `super` function to create the new class and merge the fields from the base classes.

This should fix the bug and allow the `ItemMeta` class to properly handle class creation and attribute merging.
