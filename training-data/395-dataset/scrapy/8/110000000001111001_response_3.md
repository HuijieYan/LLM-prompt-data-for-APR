The issue with the provided function is that it is trying to use the metaclass `__new__` method to create a new class, but it is doing so incorrectly. The function should be using the `__new__` method to return a new instance of the class, instead of trying to create a new class using `__new__`.

To fix the function, the corrected logic should be to create a new instance of the class using `__new__` and then modify its attributes.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_class = super().__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs)

    fields = getattr(new_class, 'fields', {})
    for n, v in attrs.items():
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v

    new_class.fields = fields
    new_class._class = new_class
    return new_class
```

In this corrected code, the `super()` function is used to create a new instance of the class. Then, the attributes are modified as required, by adding fields to the `fields` attribute of the new class. Finally, the modified class instance is returned.
