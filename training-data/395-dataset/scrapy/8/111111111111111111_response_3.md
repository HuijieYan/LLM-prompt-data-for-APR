It appears that the bug is occurring because the function `__new__` in the `ItemMeta` class is not handling the class cell correctly, which is resulting in the `TypeError` during inheritance.

The bug may be occurring in the section where the `__new__` function is processing the attributes of the class. The `__classcell__` attribute is not being handled properly, which causes the inheritance to fail.

To fix this bug, the `__new__` function should be modified to properly handle the `__classcell__` attribute.

Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            if n == "__classcell__":
                new_attrs[n] = getattr(_class, n)
            else:
                new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

This fix includes handling the `__classcell__` attribute properly by explicitly checking for it and setting it in the `new_attrs` dictionary.

This fix should resolve the `TypeError` during inheritance related to the `__classcell__` attribute.
