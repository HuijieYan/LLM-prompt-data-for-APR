The problematic function is the `__new__` method, which is a method of a metaclass. This method is responsible for creating and returning a new class based on the input parameters and attributes passed to it.

The bug occurs because the method attempts to create two different classes and return the second one rather than just manipulating the attributes and returning the original class.

To fix the bug, we should only create and modify one class and return it. Here is the corrected code:

```python
# Corrected function
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
    for n, v in attrs.items():
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
    _class.fields = fields

    return _class
```

This corrected code properly handles the input parameters and only creates and modifies the original class, returning it at the end.
