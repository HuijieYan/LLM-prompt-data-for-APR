The potential error location within the problematic function is the `__new__` method which is used to create a new class instance. The bug seems to be in the way the new class instance is being created and returned.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `__new__` method is incorrectly attempting to create a new class instance and is not handling the inheritance correctly, resulting in a TypeError when trying to use inheritance on Item.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `__new__` method to correctly handle the inheritance by returning the new class instance with the correct bases and attributes.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return type.__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

In the corrected code, we have modified the method to correctly handle the bases and return the new class instance using `type.__new__` method. This should resolve the issue of inheritance failing in Python 3.6.
