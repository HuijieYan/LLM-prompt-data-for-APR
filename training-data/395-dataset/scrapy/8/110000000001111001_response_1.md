The bug in the given code is due to the incorrect usage of the `super` method. The issue lies in the usage of `super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, ...)` and its return value. It seems that the intention is to call the `__new__` method of the superclass, but the current implementation is incorrect.

There are two instances of using `__new__` with the `super` method:
1. `_class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)`
2. `return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)`

The corrected usage of the `super` method requires the class and instance of the class as arguments. So the correct usage should be:
1. `_class = super(mcs, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)`
2. `return super(mcs, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)`

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(mcs, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(mcs, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```
