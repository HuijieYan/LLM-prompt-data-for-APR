The error `TypeError: __class__ set to <class 'tests.test_item.ItemMetaClassCellRegression.test_item_meta_classcell_regression.<locals>.MyItem'> defining 'MyItem' as <class 'tests.test_item.MyItem'>` in the test function `test_item_meta_classcell_regression` is likely caused by the discrepancy between the expected value and the actual value of the `_class` attribute, which is used in the buggy function.

The `_class` attribute seems to be incorrectly assigned in the buggy function, causing it to differ from the expected behavior. This discrepancy leads to the propagation error mentioned in the test function.

To fix this bug, the `_class` attribute assignment within the buggy function should be handled with caution to ensure that it corresponds to the expected value based on the input parameters.

Additionally, it seems that the current implementation of the `_class` attribute and its interaction with the `ItemMeta` metaclass might be causing issues with class cell propagation, leading to the error.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    bases_with_classcell = new_bases + bases
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, bases_with_classcell, attrs)

    fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

This correction includes using the `bases_with_classcell` tuple to combine new bases with the existing bases, ensuring that the class cell propagation occurs correctly. Additionally, this approach combines the attributes of both new_bases and bases, addressing the propagation issue mentioned in the test function.
