Potential Error Location: The issue may be with the use of `super()` for class `ItemMeta` within the `__new__` method. 

Reason for the Bug: The buggy function is trying to create and return a new class instance using the `__new__` method, but it is not handling the return value from `super().__new__` correctly. It is also modifying the `new_attrs` dictionary without considering the attributes of the original class.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug: The function should properly handle the return value from `super().__new__` and merge the `attrs` with `new_attrs` using the `update` method.

Corrected Code:
```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super().__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
    new_attrs = attrs.copy()  # Creating a copy of original attrs
    for n, v in attrs.items():
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
            
    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super().__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```
