The bug occurs in the __new__ method of the ItemMeta class. The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of the super() function and the return value. The __new__ method is intended to create a new instance of the class, but the return value is incorrect.

To fix this bug, the following changes can be made to the __new__ method:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super().__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for n, v in attrs.items():
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        else:
            new_attrs[n] = v

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return type(class_name, new_bases, new_attrs)
```

This fixed version of the function removes the unnecessary super() calls and uses type() to create the new class instance with the correct input parameters. This should resolve the TypeError and allow for proper inheritance with the Item class.
