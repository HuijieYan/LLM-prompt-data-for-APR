The error is occurring due to the use of the `__classcell__` attribute, which needs to be handled properly in the metaclass `ItemMeta`.

The buggy part of the code is the way the `__classcell__` attribute is being handled within the `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` metaclass. When a class is defined within a method (like in the test case provided), the cell object `__classcell__` is used to hold a reference to the newly created class. This is to correctly handle closures and inner classes defined within methods.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the `__classcell__` attribute when creating a new class using the metaclass.

Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` method of the `ItemMeta` metaclass:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in attrs:
        v = attrs[n]
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        else:
            new_attrs[n] = v

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class

    if '__classcell__' in attrs:
        new_attrs['__classcell__'] = attrs['__classcell__']

    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

In the corrected code, we explicitly handle the `__classcell__` attribute if it's present in the `attrs` parameter. We make sure to include it in the `new_attrs` of the newly created class, so that the reference to the class is handled properly.

With this fix, the `TypeError` related to the `__class__` set should be resolved.
