The error is occurring in the `__new__` method of the ItemMeta class. The bug seems to be related to how the new_bases and new_attrs are handled. The function is not correctly inheriting the attributes and bases from the superclass.

The bug occurs because the new_bases are being set to an empty tuple in both cases, and new_attrs are not being handled correctly when inheriting from the base class.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `__new__` method to correctly handle the inheritance of attributes and bases from the superclass.

Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` method:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        else:
            new_attrs[n] = v

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

This revised code ensures that new_bases are correctly inherited from the base classes, and new_attrs are handled properly to include all the relevant attributes from the base classes.
