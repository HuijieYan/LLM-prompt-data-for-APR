Potential Error Location and Reasons:
The error is occurring because the `__new__` method in the `ItemMeta` class is not properly handling the class creation and propagation of the `__classcell__` attribute, which is required for proper class inheritance and initialization.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Properly handle the creation of the new class and the propagation of the `__classcell__` attribute to ensure that class inheritance and initialization are done correctly.
2. Make sure to use the correct base classes and attributes when creating the new class.

Corrected Code:
```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class

    # Properly handle the creation of the new class and propagation of __classcell__
    new_class = super().__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
    new_class.__classcell__ = new_attrs.get('__classcell__')

    return new_class
```
