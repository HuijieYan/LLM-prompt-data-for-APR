The error seems to be occurring in the __new__ method of the ItemMeta class. The method is intended to create a new instance of the class, but it doesn't handle the input parameters correctly.

The bug seems to be in the return statement. Instead of returning a new instance using the super() method, the method should create a new instance of the class using the '__new__' method of the super() class.

Here's the corrected code for the __new__ method:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)
    
    fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return _class.__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```
