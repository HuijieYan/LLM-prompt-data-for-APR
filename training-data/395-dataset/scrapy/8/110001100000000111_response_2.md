Potential error location: The error seems to be related to the way ItemMeta is being used to create new classes, specifically with inheritance.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug appears to be caused by the incorrect use of the super() function and the incorrect creation of new classes with inheritance.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use super() correctly to call the parent class's __new__ method.
2. Ensure proper handling of inheritance when creating new classes.

```python
# corrected function
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super().__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super().__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```
