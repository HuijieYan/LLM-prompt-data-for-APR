The problematic part of the code is the `return` statement at the end of the `__new__` function. This return statement is creating a new class instance with the original `class_name` and `bases`, but with the modified `new_attrs` dictionary. This is not the intended behavior.

The reason for the bug is that the return statement should be creating a new instance of the class `ItemMeta` instead of using the original class name and bases.

To fix the bug, we can create a new class instance using the `type` function instead of calling the `__new__` method of the superclass. This way we are creating a new class with the correct attributes and bases.

Here's the corrected code for the `__new__` method:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = type('x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return _class
```
