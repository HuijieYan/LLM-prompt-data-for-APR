The error message is indicating that the `MyItem` class is causing a `TypeError` related to the `__class__` attribute being set incorrectly.

The potential error in the provided function is that it is not handling the class creation properly and is not setting the `__class__` attribute correctly.

The reason behind the bug is that the `__new__` method is not handling the creation of the new class properly, particularly in setting the `__class__` attribute.

To fix the bug, we need to properly create the new class and set the `__class__` attribute with the correct value.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class ItemMeta(type):
    def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
        new_bases = tuple(base for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
        _class = super().__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

        fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
        new_attrs = {}
        for n in dir(_class):
            v = getattr(_class, n)
            if isinstance(v, Field):
                fields[n] = v
            elif n in attrs:
                new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

        new_attrs['fields'] = fields
        new_attrs['_class'] = _class

        new_class = type(class_name, bases, new_attrs)
        setattr(new_class, '__class__', _class)

        return new_class
```

This corrected code properly handles the creation of a new class and sets the `__class__` attribute with the correct value.
