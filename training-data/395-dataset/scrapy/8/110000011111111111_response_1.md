The error seems to be occurring when the class name is being prefixed with 'x_' in the buggy function. This is causing issues with the class definition.

The bug seems to be occurring because the __new__ method of a metaclass is not properly creating a new class. The original implementation of the __new__ method is not handling the input parameters correctly and is not constructing the new class properly.

To fix this bug, the __new__ method should be updated to handle the input parameters correctly and construct the new class with the appropriate bases and attributes.

Here's the corrected __new__ method:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    new_class_name = 'x_' + class_name
    new_attrs = attrs.copy()

    for base in bases:
        for n in dir(base):
            if isinstance(getattr(base, n), Field):
                new_attrs[n] = getattr(base, n)

    new_class = super().__new__(mcs, new_class_name, new_bases, new_attrs)

    return new_class
```

This corrected __new__ method properly handles the input parameters, constructs the new class with the appropriate bases and attributes, and returns the new class. This should fix the TypeError related to class inheritance.
