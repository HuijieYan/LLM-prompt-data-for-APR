The error message indicates that there is a problem with setting the '__class__' attribute for the 'MyItem' class. This occurs because of the incorrect handling of the __classcell__ attribute within the metaclass ItemMeta. 

The buggy function incorrectly handles the new_bases and _class variables, causing the incorrect setting of the '__class__' attribute. This results in the TypeError when defining the 'MyItem' class.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the new_bases and _class variables are handled correctly, and that the '__classcell__' attribute is properly propagated.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super().__new__(mcs, class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = {}
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in attrs:
        if isinstance(attrs[n], Field):
            fields[n] = attrs[n]
        else:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class

    return super().__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
```

In this corrected code, we properly handle the new_bases and _class variables, and ensure that the '__class__' attribute is set correctly. This should resolve the TypeError mentioned in the error message.
