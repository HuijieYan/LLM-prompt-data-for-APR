The error message indicates a TypeError related to the class inheritance when using the ItemMeta class. The error specifically mentions that the '__class__' is being set to a specific class, which is causing the problem.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line where the '__class__' attribute is being set. Here is the problematic line:
```python
_class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the '__class__' attribute is being set incorrectly, which is causing the inheritance to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the '__class__' attribute is set correctly during class creation. This can be achieved by correctly setting the '__class__' attribute in the base class, and then using it in the new class creation.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class

    # Set the __class__ attribute correctly
    setattr(_class, '__class__', _class)

    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)
``` 

By correctly setting the '__class__' attribute in the base class and using it in the new class creation, the bug should be fixed.
