The error occurs in the return statement of the buggy function. The '__new__' method is being called recursively within itself, which leads to an infinite loop and results in a `RecursionError`. This is happening because the '__new__' method is intended for creating new instances of a class, not for modifying existing ones.

To fix this issue, the return statement needs to be modified. Instead of calling '__new__' method recursively, it should return the created class instance.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, 'x_' + class_name, new_bases, attrs)

    fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]

    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return _class  # Return the created class instance
```
