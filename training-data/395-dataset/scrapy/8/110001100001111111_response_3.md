The issue in the provided code is that the function is trying to create a new class with the name 'x_' + class_name, but it doesn't assign this new class to any variable or return it. Instead, it tries to create another new class using the original class name but with the updated attributes. This approach is incorrect and causing the issue.

The bug is occurring because the code is trying to create a new class with a modified name but is not using it further in the code. Instead, it tries to modify the original class and returns it.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to create a new class with the modified name and use it throughout the function.

```python
def __new__(mcs, class_name, bases, attrs):
    new_bases = tuple(base._class for base in bases if hasattr(base, '_class'))
    new_class_name = 'x_' + class_name  # Create a new name for the class
    _class = super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, new_class_name, new_bases, attrs)  # Create the new class
    
    fields = getattr(_class, 'fields', {})
    new_attrs = {}
    for n in dir(_class):
        v = getattr(_class, n)
        if isinstance(v, Field):
            fields[n] = v
        elif n in attrs:
            new_attrs[n] = attrs[n]
    
    new_attrs['fields'] = fields
    new_attrs['_class'] = _class
    return super(ItemMeta, mcs).__new__(mcs, class_name, bases, new_attrs)  # Return the new class
```

In the fixed code, the new class `x_' + class_name` is created and returned as the result of the function. This new class is used to gather the fields and assign them to the new attributes.
