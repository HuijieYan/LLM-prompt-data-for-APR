The error occurs when the function process_response encounters a 302 response with a headers' location that starts with three slashes (///). This causes the scrapy redirect to a URL different from what the browser would do. The behavior of scrapy is determined by the implementation in redirect.py, where it truncates three slashes to just one.

To fix this issue, the function process_response needs to be modified to handle the case where the headers' location starts with three slashes and ensure that the redirect URL is constructed correctly.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = response.headers['location'].decode('utf-8').lstrip('/')

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

In the corrected code:
- The location from the response headers is now decoded from bytes to utf-8 and the leading slashes are stripped (lstrip('/')) to handle the case where the location starts with three slashes.
- The redirected_url is then constructed using urljoin to correctly join the request URL with the stripped location.
- The remaining logic for handling different response statuses and issuing redirects remains unchanged.
