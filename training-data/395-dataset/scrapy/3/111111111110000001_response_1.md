The test case (`test_redirect_302_relative`) is checking whether the `process_response` method of the `RedirectMiddleware` class is correctly handling the `Location` header in the response. The expected outcome is that the `Location` header value is correctly joined with the request URL.

The error message indicates that the `req2.url` is incorrect. The expected URL is `http://i8n.example2.com/302` but the actual value is `http://www.example.com/i8n.example2.com/302`.

The potential error location within the `process_response` method is the handling of the `Location` header in the response. It seems that the joining of the URL parts is not producing the expected result.

The bug occurs because the `urljoin` function is not correctly handling the case where the `location` provided is a relative URL (`///i8n.example2.com/302`). The bug is in the line `redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)`.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `redirected_url` is formed correctly by handling the relative URL situation.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` method:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = safe_url_string(response.headers['location'])

    redirected_url = response.urljoin(location)

    if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

In the corrected code, the `redirected_url` is formed using `response.urljoin(location)` to ensure that relative URLs are handled correctly. This should fix the bug and produce the expected behavior for the test case.
