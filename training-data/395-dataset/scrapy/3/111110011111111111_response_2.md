The error occurs in the `process_response` function of the `RedirectMiddleware` class. The issue is related to how the `Location` header is being handled in the case where the `Location` starts with three slashes. This discrepancy in URL handling is causing the test case to fail.

The problem arises from the line:
```python
location = safe_url_string(response.headers['location'])
```
The `safe_url_string` function is not handling the case where the 'Location' header value starts with three slashes properly.

To fix the bug, the `safe_url_string` function should be updated to handle the case where the 'Location' header value starts with three slashes. Also, the URL resolution process needs to be adjusted to ensure it matches the behavior of browsers.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = response.headers.get('location').decode('utf-8')  # Handle bytes to string conversion
    if location.startswith('///'):  # Check for three slashes at the beginning
        location = 'http://' + location.lstrip('/')  # Adjust the URL to match browser behavior

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

In this corrected code, we handle the case where the 'Location' header value starts with three slashes by converting it to a valid URL by adding 'http://' and removing one of the slashes. This behavior aligns more closely with browser behavior.

By making these adjustments, the test case should now pass and the issue described in the GitHub report should be addressed.
