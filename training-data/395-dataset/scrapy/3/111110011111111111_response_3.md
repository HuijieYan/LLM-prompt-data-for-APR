The error in the given code is related to the handling of URLs starting with '///' in the `process_response` method of the `RedirectMiddleware` class. When the `process_response` function encounters a response status of 302 and the Location header value starts with '///', the resulting redirected URL is incorrect.

The error is likely occurring in the section of the code where the `redirected_url` is being generated. The `urljoin` function is used to join the request URL and the location, but it's not handling URLs starting with '///' correctly.

To fix this bug, the code should explicitly handle URLs that start with '///'. It should also remove the extra '/' that results from joining the URLs.

Below is the corrected code for the `process_response` method:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

class RedirectMiddleware(BaseRedirectMiddleware):
    """
    Handle redirection of requests based on response status
    and meta-refresh html tag.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
                response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
            return response
    
        allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
        if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
            return response
    
        location = safe_url_string(response.headers['location'])
        
        # Correct handling of URLs starting with '///'
        if location.startswith('///'):
            location = location[2:]  # Remove the extra '/'

        # Properly join the URL to handle '///' case
        if location.startswith('//'):
            location = f"{request.url.split('://')[0]}:{location}"

        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)
    
        # Rest of the function remains the same
        if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
    
        redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

With this correction, the URL starting with '///' is properly handled, and the resulting redirected URL will match the expected behavior. This should resolve the issue where the redirected URL was incorrect in the test case.
