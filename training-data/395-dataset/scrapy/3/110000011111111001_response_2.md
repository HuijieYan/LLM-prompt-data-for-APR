The test case `test_redirect_302_relative` checks whether the `process_response` method of the `RedirectMiddleware` class correctly processes a 302 status response with a relative URL in the `Location` header. The test checks if the `process_response` method constructs the correct new `Request` object after processing the response.

The error message indicates that the `req2.url` is not equal to `url3`. This means that the URL constructed in the `process_response` method is incorrect.

The bug is likely occurring in the code that constructs the `redirected_url` using the `urljoin` function, and subsequently in the code that constructs the new `Request` object.

The reason behind the bug is that the `urljoin` function is combining the base URL and the relative URL incorrectly, resulting in an incorrect `redirected_url`. Additionally, the construction of the `redirected` request is also incorrect.

To fix the bug, the `urljoin` function should be used to correctly combine the base URL and the relative URL. Then, the new `Request` object should be created with the corrected `redirected_url`.

Here is the corrected code for the `process_response` method:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin  # add this import if not already imported

def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    # existing code
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = response.headers['location'].decode('utf-8')  # assuming response.headers['location'] is bytes, decode to str

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

In this corrected code, the `urljoin` function is used to combine the base URL and the relative URL, and the `location` is decoded from bytes to a string. Then, a new `Request` object is created with the corrected `redirected_url` and returned.
