The test case `test_redirect_302_relative` creates a Request object `req` with a URL "http://www.example.com/302" and a Response object `rsp` with a status code 302 and a 'Location' header pointing to "///i8n.example2.com/302". After calling the `process_response` method of `self.mw` (which is an instance of the `RedirectMiddleware` class) with `req` and `rsp`, it compares the URL of the returned Request object `req2` with the expected URL "http://i8n.example2.com/302".

The error message shows that the actual URL "http://www.example.com/i8n.example2.com/302" does not match the expected URL "http://i8n.example2.com/302".

The potential error location in the `process_response` method is the calculation of the `redirected_url`, which seems to concatenate the original request's URL with the location from the response without considering if the location is a relative path.

The bug occurs because the `redirected_url` is not calculated correctly when the location in the response is a relative URL rather than an absolute URL.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the location in the response is a relative URL and then construct the `redirected_url` accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` method:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = safe_url_string(response.headers['location'])
    
    if location.startswith('http'):  # Check if location is an absolute URL
        redirected_url = location
    else:
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)  # Calculate full URL from relative path

    if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

With this correction, the `redirected_url` is calculated taking into account both relative and absolute URLs, resolving the bug identified in the test case.
