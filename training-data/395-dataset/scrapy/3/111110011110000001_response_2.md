The test case `test_redirect_302_relative` is checking the functionality of the `process_response` method of the `RedirectMiddleware` class. The test is failing because the final URL after redirection is not matching the expected URL.

The potential error location within the `process_response` method is likely to be in the `urljoin` function, where the original request URL and the location header are being joined.

The bug is occurring because when joining the request URL and the location header, the `urljoin` function is not handling the case of an absolute URL in the location. This causes the URL to be incorrectly combined, resulting in `http://www.example.com/i8n.example2.com/302` instead of the expected `http://i8n.example2.com/302`.

To fix the bug, the `urljoin` function should be used with the correct parameters so that it handles absolute URLs properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` method:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

# ... (other imports and class definition)

def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (
        request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False)
        or response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])
        or response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', [])
        or request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)
    ):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = safe_url_string(response.headers['location'])

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)  # Use urljoin to handle absolute URLs

    if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

Using `urljoin` as shown in the corrected code will handle the absolute URL properly and result in the correct redirected URL, addressing the bug in the original code.
