Additional context
I check the defination of Location in rfc and end with reference resolution. But I fail to findout how to resolve the Location startswith ///. So I don't know why Chrome did so.

The behavior of scrapy is determined by redirect.py#L73, which will truncate /// to /ã€‚

I'm wandering the differents betweent scarpy and browser...
