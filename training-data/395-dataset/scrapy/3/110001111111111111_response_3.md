The problem is occurring in the process_response function of the RedirectMiddleware. The issue is that when the response status is 302 and the Location header starts with three slashes, the redirection is not handled properly.

The reason behind the bug is that the original code replaces the three slashes with a single slash, which leads to an incorrect redirection URL.

To fix this bug, we can update the code to handle the case where the Location header starts with three slashes. Instead of replacing the three slashes with one, we should check if the Location header starts with three slashes, and if it does, remove those slashes and append the rest of the URL to the request's original URL.

Here's the corrected code for the process_response function:

```python
import re

def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = safe_url_string(response.headers['location'])

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    # Handle case where Location starts with three slashes
    if re.match(r'^///', location):
        pattern = r'/+'
        redirected_url = re.sub(pattern, '/', redirected_url, count=2)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

This updated code now checks if the Location header starts with three slashes using regular expression and then removes those slashes and appends the rest of the URL to the original request's URL.

With this updated code, the issue of incorrect redirection URL with three slashes at the start should be resolved, and the test case should pass without any assertion errors.
