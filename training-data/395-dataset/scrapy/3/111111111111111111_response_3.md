The error in the provided code is occurring because the 'Location' header in the response is not being handled correctly. When the 'Location' header starts with three slashes ('///'), the redirection is not being performed as expected, resulting in an incorrect redirected URL.

To fix the bug, the handling of the 'Location' header needs to be adjusted in the `process_response` method of the `RedirectMiddleware` class. Specifically, when the 'Location' header starts with '///', it should be replaced with the appropriate scheme and the original request URL.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the code in the `process_response` method to properly handle the 'Location' header when it starts with '///'. The corrected code for the `process_response` method is provided below.

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = safe_url_string(response.headers['location'])

    # Correcting the handling of 'Location' header starting with '///'
    if location.startswith('///'):
        request_scheme = request.url.split('://')[0]
        redirected_url = request_scheme + ':' + location
    else:
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

By implementing the suggested changes, the 'Location' header starting with '///' will be correctly handled, resulting in the expected behavior during redirection.
