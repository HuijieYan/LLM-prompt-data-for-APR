The error occurs when the headers' location in the response starts with three slashes (///). In such cases, the redirecting URL is being generated incorrectly, resulting in unexpected behavior. The root cause of the bug is that the function does not handle the scenario where the location starts with three slashes.

To fix the bug, the function needs to check for the three slashes at the start of the location and handle it appropriately by properly resolving the URL.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from scrapy.http import Request
from w3lib.url import safe_url_string
from urllib.parse import urljoin

# ...

class RedirectMiddleware(BaseRedirectMiddleware):
    """
    Handle redirection of requests based on response status
    and meta-refresh html tag.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # corrected function
    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
                response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
            return response
    
        allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
        if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
            return response
    
        location = safe_url_string(response.headers['location'])
    
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)
    
        if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
    
        if redirected_url.startswith('///'):
            scheme = request_scheme(request)
            redirected_url = scheme + ':' + redirected_url
    
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

In the corrected code, after generating the redirected URL, I added a conditional statement to check if the URL starts with '///'. If it does, the function determines the scheme from the original request using the `request_scheme` function and appends the scheme to the redirected URL. This fix handles the case where the location starts with three slashes and ensures that the URL is properly resolved.
