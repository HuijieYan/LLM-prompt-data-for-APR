1. The test case provided is related to the 302 redirection response with a headers location that starts with three slashes. The expected behavior is to redirect to a specific URL, but the actual behavior is redirecting to a different URL.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic used to handle the redirection response with a headers location that starts with three slashes.

3. The bug occurs because the function does not handle the scenario where the headers location starts with three slashes correctly. This leads to incorrect URL redirection.

4. To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle the headers location that starts with three slashes. This may involve checking the format of the location URL and properly constructing the redirected URL.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = safe_url_string(response.headers['location'])

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    if location.startswith('///'):
        location = location[2:]  # remove the extra slashes at the beginning
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
    else:
        redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)

    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

In the corrected code, if the headers location starts with three slashes, it is handled by removing the extra slashes at the beginning before constructing the redirected URL. This modification ensures that the URL redirection is handled correctly in the scenario described in the issue.
