The error occurs when the response status is 302 and the headers' location starts with three slashes. This results in a redirection to a URL different from what the browser would do.

The bug is likely in the section of the code where the redirected URL is being constructed and the slashes in the 'Location' header are being handled. The current code does not handle 'Location' headers that start with three slashes correctly, leading to incorrect redirection.

To fix the bug, the condition for checking if the 'Location' header is present and if the response status is in allowed_status needs to be updated to account for the case where the 'Location' header starts with three slashes. Additionally, when constructing the redirected URL, the extra slashes need to be handled properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` function:

```python
from w3lib.url import safe_url_string
from w3lib.url import urljoin

class RedirectMiddleware(BaseRedirectMiddleware):
    """
    Handle redirection of requests based on response status
    and meta-refresh html tag.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
                response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
            return response

        allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
        if 'Location' in response.headers:
            location = safe_url_string(response.headers['Location'][0].decode('utf-8'))
            if location.startswith('///'):
                location = location[2:]  # Remove the extra slashes
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

            if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
                redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
                return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

            redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        return response
```

In the corrected code, we first decode the 'Location' header from bytes to a string and then remove the extra slashes if it starts with three slashes. This ensures that the redirected URL is constructed correctly, addressing the bug where the redirection was incorrect when the 'Location' header starts with three slashes.
