The `test_redirect_302_relative` test case is checking that when a response with status 302 and a 'Location' header is received, the `process_response` method of the `RedirectMiddleware` class should return a new `Request` with the correct URL.

The error message indicates that the returned URL is incorrect, as it combines the original URL with the URL from the 'Location' header instead of replacing it.

The bug occurs because the `redirected_url` is being generated by joining the original request URL with the 'Location' header without considering the case when the 'Location' header is a complete URL.

To fix the bug, we should check if the 'Location' header is an absolute URL. If it is, we should use that URL as the redirected URL. If it is a relative URL, we should join it with the original request URL to get the redirected URL.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` method:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

class RedirectMiddleware:
    # ... other methods ...

    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
                response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
            return response

        allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
        if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
            return response

        location = safe_url_string(response.headers['location'])

        if location.startswith('http://') or location.startswith('https://'):
            redirected_url = location
        else:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

        if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

This revised code first checks if the 'Location' header contains an absolute URL. If it does, it sets `redirected_url` to that URL. If it doesn't, it joins the 'Location' header URL with the original request URL to get the `redirected_url`. This should fix the bug and ensure that the correct URL is returned in the `process_response` method.
