The bug in the provided function is that it does not handle the response.headers correctly, specifically the 'Location' header. This causes the variable 'location' to have an incorrect value, which results in the 'redirected_url' and 'redirected' variables being incorrect as well.

To fix the bug, the code needs to correctly parse the 'Location' header and form the 'redirected_url' and 'redirected' variables using the correct URL. This can be achieved by properly manipulating the 'response.headers' to extract the correct 'Location' value.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = safe_url_string(response.headers.getlist('Location')[0].decode('utf-8'))

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

In the corrected code:
- We correctly handle the 'Location' header by using response.headers.getlist('Location')[0].decode('utf-8') to extract the URL.
- We then use the urljoin function to form the 'redirected_url' by joining the original request URL with the extracted location URL.
- Finally, the 'redirected' variable is formed using the correct 'redirected_url' and is passed to the _redirect function.

This corrected code should handle the 'Location' header correctly and form the 'redirected_url' and 'redirected' variables as expected.
