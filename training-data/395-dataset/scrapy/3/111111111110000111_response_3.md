The test case `test_redirect_302_relative` is checking the behavior of the `process_response` method in the `RedirectMiddleware` class. The test creates a `Request` object with a URL, then creates a `Response` object with a status code of 302 and a `Location` header pointing to another URL. The test then checks if the `process_response` method correctly handles the redirection and returns a new `Request` with the expected URL.

The error message indicates that the actual redirected URL is different from the expected URL, specifically due to the addition of `http://www.example.com/` before the redirected URL.

The potential error location within the `process_response` method is likely the way the redirected URL is being handled, particularly when it starts with `///`.

The bug occurs because the code in the `process_response` method does not handle URLs that start with `///` correctly. This results in the redirected URL being formed improperly, leading to incorrect behavior in redirection.

To fix the bug, the code needs to properly handle URLs that start with `///` and adjust the redirected URL accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` method:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = safe_url_string(response.headers['location'])

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)
    
    # Correct handling of URLs that start with ///
    if redirected_url.startswith('///'):
        redirected_url = 'http:' + redirected_url

    if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

In the corrected code, when the redirected URL starts with `///`, it is adjusted by adding `http:` to the beginning of the URL, which ensures that the URL is formed correctly for redirection.
