1. The test case is testing the behavior of the `process_response` method of the `RedirectMiddleware` class when a 302 response is received. The expected behavior is that the method should properly handle the redirection and return a new `Request` object with the correct URL.

2. The potential error location within the `process_response` method is the part where the `redirected_url` is being generated and the new `Request` object is being constructed.

3. The bug occurs because the `urljoin` function is concatenating the `request.url` with the `location` provided in the response headers without taking into account the possibility that `location` might be a complete URL. This leads to an incorrect concatenation of the URLs, resulting in the wrong redirected URL.

4. One possible approach for fixing the bug is to check if the `location` is a complete URL or a relative URL. If it's a complete URL, use it as is. If it's a relative URL, then concatenate it with the base URL (`request.url`) using the `urljoin` function. This will ensure that the redirected URL is constructed correctly.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` method:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = safe_url_string(response.headers['location'])

    if urlparse(location).scheme:  # check if location is a complete URL
        redirected_url = location
    else:
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)  # concatenate relative URL with base URL

    if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

With this corrected code, the `urljoin` function is used to properly construct the redirected URL, taking into account both relative and complete URLs.
