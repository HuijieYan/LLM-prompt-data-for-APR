The issue seems to be related to the handling of the `Location` header in the response. When the response status is 302 and the `Location` header starts with three slashes (///), the redirection is not happening as expected. Instead, it redirects to a URL different from what the browser does.

The potential error location within the `process_response` function is the handling of the `redirected_url` when the response status is 302 and the `Location` header starts with three slashes.

The bug is occurring because the function does not handle URLs that start with three slashes properly. Instead of redirecting to the expected URL, it redirects to an incorrect URL.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the code to properly handle URLs with three slashes in the `Location` header. We can use the `urljoin` function to handle the URL concatenation properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` function:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = safe_url_string(response.headers['location'])

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

In the corrected code, we use the `urljoin` function to properly handle the concatenation of the `request.url` and the `location`. This should ensure that the redirection happens as expected, even when the `Location` header starts with three slashes.
