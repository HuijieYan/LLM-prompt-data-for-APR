The problem seems to be occurring in the `process_response` method of the `RedirectMiddleware` class. When the response status is 302 and the Location header starts with three slashes (`///`), the redirection in Scrapy is not behaving as expected.

The bug occurs because when the Location header starts with three slashes, the `urljoin` function doesn't handle it correctly, and Scrapy redirects to a different URL compared to what a browser does.

To fix this bug, one approach is to modify the code to handle the case where the Location header starts with three slashes and ensure that it is resolved correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` method of the `RedirectMiddleware` class:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (
        request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False)
        or response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', [])
        or response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', [])
        or request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)
    ):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = safe_url_string(response.headers['location'])

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    # Handle the case where the Location header starts with three slashes
    if location.startswith('///'):
        redirected_url = urlparse(request.url)._replace(path=location.lstrip('/')).geturl()
    
    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

In the corrected code, when the Location header starts with three slashes (`///`), we modify the `redirected_url` to ensure that it is resolved correctly by using `urlparse` to handle the URL with three slashes in the path. This change should address the issue with 302 redirection when the headers' location starts with three slashes.
