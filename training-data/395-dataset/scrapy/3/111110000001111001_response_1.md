The bug in the provided function is that it does not correctly handle the URL redirection based on the 'Location' header in the response. 

In the given buggy function, the 'safe_url_string' and 'urljoin' functions are not defined, so it is assumed that they are part of the Scrapy framework. 

The issue is that the 'location' extraction and URL redirection process is incorrect. It does not correctly handle the 'Location' header value and construct the redirected URL.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the 'location' value is properly extracted from the response and construct the redirected URL based on the original request URL.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin
import w3lib.url

# class declaration containing the buggy function
class RedirectMiddleware(BaseRedirectMiddleware):
    """
    Handle redirection of requests based on response status
    and meta-refresh html tag.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the fixed function
    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
                response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
            return response

        allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
        if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
            return response

        location = response.headers.get('Location').decode('utf-8')
        redirected_url = w3lib.url.safe_url_string(urljoin(request.url, location))

        if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

In this corrected function, the 'Location' is correctly extracted from the response headers, and the redirected URL is constructed using the 'urljoin' function. This ensures that the URL redirection process is handled properly.
