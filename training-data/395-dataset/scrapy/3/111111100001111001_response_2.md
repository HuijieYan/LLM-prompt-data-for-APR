The bug occurs when the 'Location' header is present in the response but the location is an absolute URL starting with 'http', 'https', or another scheme. In this case, the `urljoin` function incorrectly appends the absolute URL to the current request's URL, resulting in a broken redirect URL.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to check if the location is an absolute URL before using the `urljoin` function to construct the redirected URL. If the location is absolute, it should replace the request URL entirely.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

class RedirectMiddleware(BaseRedirectMiddleware):
    """
    Handle redirection of requests based on response status
    and meta-refresh html tag.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
                response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
            return response

        allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
        if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
            return response

        location = safe_url_string(response.headers['location']).decode('utf-8')  # Ensure location is decoded to a string
        if re.match(r'^https?://', location):  # Check if location is an absolute URL
            redirected = request.replace(url=location)  # If so, replace the request URL
        else:
            redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)
            if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
                redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            else:
                redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

In the corrected code, we ensure that the 'Location' header value is decoded to a string using `decode('utf-8')`. Then, we use a regular expression to check if the location is an absolute URL. If it is, we replace the request URL with the absolute URL. Otherwise, we construct the redirected URL as before.

This fix ensures that the redirected URL is correctly handled, taking into account both relative and absolute URLs.
