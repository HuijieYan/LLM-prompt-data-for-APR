The buggy function `process_response` is supposed to handle redirection of requests based on response status and meta-refresh HTML tag. It seems the buggy function is not correctly handling the redirection based on the `Location` header in the response.

As per the test case `test_redirect_302_relative`, the assertion fails for `req2.url` which is expected to be `'http://i8n.example2.com/302'` but the actual value is `'http://www.example.com/i8n.example2.com/302'`. This indicates that the handling of the `Location` header in the response is not done correctly.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code is not processing the `Location` header correctly. It is not joining the `request.url` and the `Location` to get the redirected URL.

The bug can be fixed by properly handling the `Location` header and joining it with the `request.url` to obtain the correct redirected URL.

The corrected code for the problematic function `process_response` is as follows:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

class RedirectMiddleware(BaseRedirectMiddleware):
    """
    Handle redirection of requests based on response status
    and meta-refresh html tag.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # corrected process_response function
    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
                response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
            return response

        allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
        if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
            return response

        location = response.headers['Location'].decode('utf-8')  # Decode byte string to regular string
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

        if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

With these changes, the corrected function should now properly handle the `Location` header and join it with the `request.url` to get the correct redirected URL, resolving the bug in the original code.
