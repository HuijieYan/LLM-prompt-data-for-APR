The bug in the provided function `process_response` is that the `safe_url_string` function is not defined, and it is used to process the `location` before `urljoin`. Additionally, the formatting of the redirected URL seems to be incorrect based on the provided input and expected output.

To fix the bug, the code can be updated to properly format the redirected URL and use the urlparse library to safely join the URLs.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, urljoin

class RedirectMiddleware:
    # ... other methods ...

    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
                response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
            return response

        allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
        if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
            return response

        location = response.headers.get('Location').decode('utf-8')
        redirected_url = urljoin(response.url, location)

        if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

With these changes, the redirected URL is properly formatted and the urlparse library is used to ensure the URLs are joined safely. This should fix the bug and provide the expected output in the test case.
