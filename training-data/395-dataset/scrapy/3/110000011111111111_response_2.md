The error occurs because the `response.headers['location']` appears to begin with three slashes ('///'), causing the incorrect redirection to a URL different from what is expected. This behavior is contrary to what a browser would do, which creates the bug.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `process_response` method to handle the case when the `response.headers['location']` starts with three slashes.

The corrected code for the `process_response` method is as follows:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin
from scrapy.http.request import Request
from scrapy.http.response import Response

def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response
    
    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = response.headers['location'].decode('utf-8')  # Decode bytes to string
    if location.startswith('///'):  # Check for three slashes at the beginning
        location = location[2:]  # Remove the additional slash
        
    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

The corrected code decodes the bytes string in `location` to a normal string and then checks if it starts with '///'. If it does, it removes the additional slash and proceeds with the redirection logic. This modification fixes the bug and ensures that the redirection behaves as expected.
