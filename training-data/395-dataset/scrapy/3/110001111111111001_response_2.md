The test case `test_redirect_302_relative` is checking the functionality of the `process_response` method of the `RedirectMiddleware` class. The error occurs when the expected URL (`url3`) does not match the actual URL (`req2.url`).

The potential error location within the `process_response` method is likely related to the construction of the `redirected_url` and the usage of the `urljoin` function.

The bug occurs because the `redirected_url` is constructed by joining the `request.url` with the `location` from the response's headers. In the original code, the `location` is directly assigned the value of `safe_url_string(response.headers['location'])` which might be causing the issue with the URL formation.

To fix the bug, it's important to ensure that the `redirected_url` is constructed correctly using appropriate methods and functions to handle URL concatenation.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` method of the `RedirectMiddleware` class:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

class RedirectMiddleware:
    # ... (other methods) ...

    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
                response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
            return response

        allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
        if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
            return response

        location = response.headers.get('Location').decode('utf-8')  # Decoding the location from bytes to string
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

        if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

In the corrected code:
1. After getting the `Location` from `response.headers`, `decoded` function is used to convert the bytes to a string.
2. The `urljoin` function is used to construct the `redirected_url` by joining the `request.url` with the decoded `location`.
3. `redirected_url` is subsequently used to form the `redirected` request for further processing.

By applying these corrections, the issue with incorrect URL formation should be resolved, and the test case `test_redirect_302_relative` should pass without errors.
