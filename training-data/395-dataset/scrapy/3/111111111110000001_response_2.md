The test case is testing the behavior of the `process_response` method of the `RedirectMiddleware` class. The error message indicates that the URL is not being correctly redirected. 

The potential error location within the `process_response` method is the line where the `redirected_url` is being calculated using `urljoin(request.url, location)`. 

The bug seems to be happening because the `redirected_url` is being calculated incorrectly, resulting in a mismatch between the expected URL and the actual URL.

To fix the bug, the `redirected_url` should be constructed using the current base URL and the new location URL. This can be achieved using the `urljoin` function provided by the Python `urllib.parse` module.

Here is the corrected code for the `process_response` method:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = safe_url_string(response.headers['location'])

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```
