The bug in the `process_response` function seems to be in the way it handles the `Location` header in the response. It appends the location to the request URL without taking into account the domain, leading to the mismatch in the test case.

The reason behind the bug is that the function is not properly resolving the relative URL in the `Location` header to an absolute URL. As a result, it is incorrectly forming the `redirected_url`.

To fix the bug, we need to use the `urljoin` function to properly resolve the relative URL. Additionally, we need to remove the redundant domain part from the `redirected_url`.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = response.headers['location'].decode()  # Decode from bytes to string
    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

With this correction, the `redirected_url` will be properly formed as an absolute URL, and it should match the expected value in the test case.
