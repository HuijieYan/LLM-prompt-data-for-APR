The test case "test_redirect_302_relative" is failing because the redirection is not happening as expected. The error message indicates that the URL after redirection is incorrect, specifically due to the presence of extra slashes.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the calculation of the redirected_url and the subsequent processing of the URL for redirection.

The bug is occurring because the function is not handling the URLs with extra slashes in the "Location" header properly. The function is not resolving the URLs correctly and is not handling the cases where the "Location" header starts with three slashes.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle the URLs with extra slashes in the "Location" header and resolve them properly.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = safe_url_string(response.headers['location'])
    location = urljoin(request.url, location)  # Resolving the location URL correctly

    if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=location)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, location)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

In the corrected code, after obtaining the "Location" header from the response, the location URL is resolved correctly using the `urljoin` function to handle extra slashes.

By resolving the location URL properly, the bug where the redirection was not happening as expected has been fixed.
