The error message from the test function indicates that the expected redirected URL is 'http://i8n.example2.com/302', but the actual redirected URL is 'http://www.example.com/i8n.example2.com/302'. This suggests that there is an issue with the way the URL is being constructed during redirection.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the logic for constructing the 'redirected_url' and handling the response status codes.

The bug occurs because the code is incorrectly constructing the 'redirected_url' by joining the request URL with the location obtained from the response headers. The incorrect result is due to the presence of three slashes ('///') at the beginning of the location URL.

To fix the bug, the function should properly handle the case where the location URL starts with three slashes. Instead of directly joining the request URL with the location, the function should first handle the case of a location URL starting with three slashes and then construct the redirected URL accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = response.headers['location']
    
    # Handle the case where the location URL starts with three slashes
    if location.startswith('///'):
        location = 'http:' + location

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

With this correction, the function now properly handles the case where the location URL starts with three slashes, ensuring that the redirected URL is constructed correctly.
