The potential error in the code is the `urljoin` function being called on an absolute URL and a relative URL without handling it properly. This could lead to incorrect URL generation.

The error occurs because the `urljoin` function should only be called with two absolute or two relative URLs. If one is absolute and the other is relative, the behavior may vary and lead to unexpected results.

To fix this issue, we can first check if the `location` obtained from the response headers is an absolute URL. If it is, we can directly use it as the `redirected_url`. If it is a relative URL, we can use the `urljoin` function to join it with the base URL obtained from the `request.url`.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = safe_url_string(response.headers['location'])

    if location.startswith(('http://', 'https://')):
        redirected_url = location
    else:
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

With this correction, the `redirected_url` will be generated correctly regardless of whether the `Location` in the response headers is an absolute or a relative URL.
