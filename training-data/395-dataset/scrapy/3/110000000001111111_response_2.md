The error in the provided function occurs when the response's headers' location starts with '///'. This causes the incorrect redirection to a URL different from what the browser would do.

The issue lies in the following line of code:
```python
location = safe_url_string(response.headers['location'])
```
When the location starts with '///', the safe_url_string function may not handle it correctly, leading to the incorrect redirection.

To fix this issue, the safe_url_string function needs to be updated to handle the '///' case and resolve the location appropriately.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = response.headers.get('location').decode('utf-8')
    if location.startswith('///'):
        location = 'https:' + location

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

In the corrected function, the 'safe_url_string' function has been replaced with decoding the 'Location' header and checking if it starts with '///'. If it does, 'https:' is appended to the location. This amended value is then used to construct the redirected URL. This ensures that the redirection is handled correctly even when the location starts with '///'.
