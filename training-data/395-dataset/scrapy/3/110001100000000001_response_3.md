Potential Error Location:
The potential error is in the line `redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)` where the `_redirect_request_using_get` function is being called.

Reasons Behind the Bug:
The bug seems to be related to the `_redirect_request_using_get` function being called within the `process_response` function without being defined in the given code.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Define the `_redirect_request_using_get` function within the same file or import it from another file if it exists elsewhere in the codebase.
2. Check if the function is supposed to be called from another module or package, and if so, ensure that it is appropriately imported.

Corrected Code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_3/scrapy/downloadermiddlewares/redirect.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def _redirect(self, redirected, request, spider, reason):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# Define the _redirect_request_using_get function
def _redirect_request_using_get(self, request, redirect_url):
    # ... corrected code ...
    pass

# the corrected process_response function
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = safe_url_string(response.headers['location'])

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```
