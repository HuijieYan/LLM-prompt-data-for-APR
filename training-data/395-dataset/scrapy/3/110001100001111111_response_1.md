The bug occurs in the `process_response` method of the `RedirectMiddleware` class. When the response status is 302 and the 'Location' header starts with '///', the redirected URL is incorrect.

The bug occurs because the 'Location' header is not parsed correctly, leading to an incorrect redirected URL being generated.

To fix the bug, we need to update the code to handle the case where the 'Location' header starts with '///' and ensure that the redirected URL is constructed correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `process_response` method of the `RedirectMiddleware` class:

```python
from w3lib.url import safe_url_string
from urllib.parse import urljoin

class RedirectMiddleware:
    # ... other methods ...

    def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
        if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
                response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
                request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
            return response

        allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
        if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
            return response

        location = safe_url_string(response.headers['location'].decode('utf-8'))  # decode the bytes to string
        if location.startswith('///'):
            # Remove the duplicated slashes before joining with the base URL
            location = location[2:]
        redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

        if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
            redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
            return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

        redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

In the corrected code, we decode the bytes of the 'Location' header to a string and remove the duplicated slashes at the beginning of the location URL. This ensures that the redirected URL is constructed correctly.

With these changes, the bug related to 302 redirection with headers location starting with '///' should be fixed.
