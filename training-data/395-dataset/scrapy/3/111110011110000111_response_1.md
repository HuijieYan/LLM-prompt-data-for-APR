Based on the error message and the provided test case, it seems that the bug is related to how the "Location" header is handled in the process_response function. The issue is specifically with the URL containing three slashes at the beginning, which is not being handled correctly by the current function.

The reason behind the bug is that the code does not properly handle the case where the "Location" header starts with three slashes. This causes the incorrect redirection of the URL.

To fix this bug, the process_response function should be updated to handle the case where the "Location" header starts with three slashes. The function should properly resolve the URL while accounting for this edge case.

Here is the corrected process_response function:

```python
def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = safe_url_string(response.headers['location'])

    # Handle the case where 'Location' starts with '///'
    if location.startswith('///'):
        location = 'http://' + location.lstrip('/')

    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)

    if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

With this correction, the process_response function should properly handle the case where the "Location" header starts with three slashes, and the redirection should work as expected.
