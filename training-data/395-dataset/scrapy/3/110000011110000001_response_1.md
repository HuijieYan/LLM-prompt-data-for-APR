The test case 'test_redirect_302_relative' is checking for a redirect from 'http://www.example.com/302' to 'http://i8n.example2.com/302' with a 302 status code. However, the error message indicates that the redirected URL is incorrect.

The issue seems to be with the construction of the 'redirected_url' in the 'process_response' function. Based on the error message, it looks like the 'redirected_url' is being formed by joining the original request URL with the location from the response headers, resulting in a malformed URL.

This bug occurs because the construction of the 'redirected_url' does not handle relative URLs correctly. The resolution of the relative URL is not being performed in a way that conforms to standard URL resolution rules.

To fix the bug, the 'redirected_url' needs to be constructed by resolving the relative URL against the original request URL properly. This can be done using Python's `urllib.parse.urljoin` function. Additionally, it's important to consider cases where the Location header contains an absolute URL, in which case the original URL should be overridden.

Here's the corrected 'process_response' function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

def process_response(self, request, response, spider):
    if (request.meta.get('dont_redirect', False) or
            response.status in getattr(spider, 'handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            response.status in request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_list', []) or
            request.meta.get('handle_httpstatus_all', False)):
        return response

    allowed_status = (301, 302, 303, 307, 308)
    if 'Location' not in response.headers or response.status not in allowed_status:
        return response

    location = response.headers['location']
    redirected_url = urljoin(request.url, location)  # Resolve relative or absolute URL

    if response.status in (301, 307, 308) or request.method == 'HEAD':
        redirected = request.replace(url=redirected_url)
        return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)

    redirected = self._redirect_request_using_get(request, redirected_url)
    return self._redirect(redirected, request, spider, response.status)
```

With this correction, the 'redirected_url' is formed by resolving the relative or absolute 'location' URL against the original request URL using `urljoin`, ensuring that the resulting URL is correctly formed.
