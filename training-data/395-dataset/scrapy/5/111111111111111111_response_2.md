The test case 'test_follow_None_url' is trying to test the behavior of the 'follow' function when called with a None value for the 'url' parameter. The test expects that a ValueError should be raised, but it's currently not being raised. This indicates that there is a bug in the 'follow' function.

The potential error location within the 'follow' function is the check for the 'url' parameter. Currently, the function is not handling the case when the 'url' parameter is None.

The bug occurred because the 'follow' function does not have a proper check to handle the case when the 'url' parameter is None. As a result, it tries to process the None value as a valid URL, leading to unexpected behavior and the ValueError not being raised as expected.

To fix the bug, the 'follow' function should have a check at the beginning to raise a ValueError if the 'url' parameter is None. This check will ensure that the function does not proceed if the 'url' parameter is invalid.

Here's the corrected code for the 'follow' function:

```python
def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
           cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
           dont_filter=False, errback=None):
    # type: (...) -> Request
    """
    Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
    It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
    but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
    not only an absolute URL.
    
    :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow` 
    method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
    and Link objects.
    """
    if url is None:
        raise ValueError("Invalid URL: None")
    
    if isinstance(url, Link):
        url = url.url
    url = self.urljoin(url)
    return Request(url, callback,
                   method=method,
                   headers=headers,
                   body=body,
                   cookies=cookies,
                   meta=meta,
                   encoding=encoding,
                   priority=priority,
                   dont_filter=dont_filter,
                   errback=errback)
```

With this fix, the 'follow' function will raise a ValueError if the 'url' parameter is None, as expected by the test case.
