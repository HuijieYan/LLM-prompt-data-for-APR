1. The test case is checking whether the `follow` method raises a `ValueError` when called with a `None` url. The error message indicates that the `ValueError` is not being raised as expected.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `follow` method where it should be raising a `ValueError` when the `url` is `None`.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `follow` method is not handling the case when the `url` is `None`, which should result in a `ValueError`.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Add a check at the beginning of the `follow` method to raise a `ValueError` if the `url` is `None`.
   - Modify the `follow` method to handle the `None` url case appropriately and raise a `ValueError` when necessary.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
           cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
           dont_filter=False, errback=None):
    # type: (...) -> Request
    """
    Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
    It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
    but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
    not only an absolute URL.
    
    :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow` 
    method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
    and Link objects.
    """
    if url is None:
        raise ValueError("Cannot follow a None url")
    
    if isinstance(url, Link):
        url = url.url
    url = self.urljoin(url)
    return Request(url, callback,
                   method=method,
                   headers=headers,
                   body=body,
                   cookies=cookies,
                   meta=meta,
                   encoding=encoding,
                   priority=priority,
                   dont_filter=dont_filter,
                   errback=errback)
```
