The bug in the follow function is likely due to the fact that it does not handle the case where the `url` parameter is None. This is evident from the error message in the test function, which indicates that the ValueError is not raised by the follow function when the url parameter is None.

To fix this bug, we need to add a conditional check at the beginning of the follow function to handle the case where the `url` parameter is None. We should raise a ValueError in this case to match the expected behavior in the test function.

Here's the corrected code for the follow function:

```python
def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
           cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
           dont_filter=False, errback=None):
    # type: (...) -> Request
    """
    Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
    It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
    but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
    not only an absolute URL.
    
    :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow` 
    method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
    and Link objects.
    """
    if url is None:
        raise ValueError("URL cannot be None")
    
    if isinstance(url, Link):
        url = url.url
    url = self.urljoin(url)
    return Request(url, callback, method=method, headers=headers, body=body,
                   cookies=cookies, meta=meta, encoding=encoding, priority=priority,
                   dont_filter=dont_filter, errback=errback)
```

With this fix, the follow function will raise a ValueError when the `url` parameter is None, matching the behavior expected in the test function.
