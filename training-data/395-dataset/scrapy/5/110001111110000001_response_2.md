The potential error location in the problematic function is the usage of self.urljoin(url). The error occurs because the function urljoin is being called on self without being defined as part of the class. This leads to the AttributeError being raised when the function is called.

To fix this, the urljoin function should be accessed from the correct location, either as part of the class or from an imported module.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected follow function
def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
           cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
           dont_filter=False, errback=None):
    # type: (...) -> Request
    """
    Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
    It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
    but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
    not only an absolute URL.
    
    :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow` 
    method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
    and Link objects.
    """
    if isinstance(url, Link):
        url = url.url
    # Assuming that urljoin is a function from a module and not part of the class,
    # import the module that contains urljoin function
    from scrapy.utils.url import urljoin
    url = urljoin(self.url, url)
    return Request(url, callback,
                   method=method,
                   headers=headers,
                   body=body,
                   cookies=cookies,
                   meta=meta,
                   encoding=encoding,
                   priority=priority,
                   dont_filter=dont_filter,
                   errback=errback)
```

By importing the module containing the urljoin function, we can access the urljoin function and use it within the follow function without encountering the AttributeError.
