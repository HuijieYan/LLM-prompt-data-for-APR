The potential error in the provided function is the lack of definition for the 'Link' class being used in the function. Additionally, the 'self.urljoin' method used in the code is assuming that it is a method of the 'Response' class, which is not clear from the given context.

The bug occurred due to the assumption of the existence of the 'Link' class and the 'urljoin' method without proper definition or context.

To fix the bug, the 'Link' class and the 'urljoin' method need to be properly defined or imported. Additionally, the usage of 'self.urljoin' needs to be reviewed for correctness.

The corrected code for the buggy function is as follows:

```python
def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
           cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
           dont_filter=False, errback=None):
    # type: (...) -> Request
    """
    Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
    It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
    but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
    not only an absolute URL.
    
    :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow` 
    method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
    and Link objects.
    """
    
    # Assuming 'urljoin' is a method of the response object
    if hasattr(self, 'urljoin') and callable(self.urljoin):
        url = self.urljoin(url)
    return Request(url, callback,
                   method=method,
                   headers=headers,
                   body=body,
                   cookies=cookies,
                   meta=meta,
                   encoding=encoding,
                   priority=priority,
                   dont_filter=dont_filter,
                   errback=errback)
```
