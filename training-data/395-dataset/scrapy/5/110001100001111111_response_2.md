The potential error in the code lies in the lines:
```python
if isinstance(url, Link):
    url = url.url
url = self.urljoin(url)
```
When `self.urljoin(url)` is called, it is expected to join the URL with the base URL, but this method is not defined in the provided code.

The bug occurs because the `urljoin` method is not defined in the code provided. This method should take the base URL of the response and join it with the input URL to create a complete URL. As this method is not defined, it will raise an AttributeError.

To fix the bug, we need to define the `urljoin` method for the `Response` class. Here's the corrected code for the `follow` method with the `urljoin` method included:

```python
from urllib.parse import urljoin

class Response:
  
    # ... omitted code ...
  
    def urljoin(self, url):
        return urljoin(self.url, url)
        
    def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
               cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
               dont_filter=False, errback=None):
        # type: (...) -> Request
        """
        Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
        It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
        but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
        not only an absolute URL.
        
        :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow` 
        method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
        and Link objects.
        """
        if isinstance(url, Link):
            url = url.url
        url = self.urljoin(url)
        return Request(url, callback,
                       method=method,
                       headers=headers,
                       body=body,
                       cookies=cookies,
                       meta=meta,
                       encoding=encoding,
                       priority=priority,
                       dont_filter=dont_filter,
                       errback=errback)
```

With the `urljoin` method defined, the `follow` method will now work as expected to join the input URL with the base URL. This should fix the bug and prevent the AttributeError from occurring.
