Potential Error Location: The error in the provided code seems to be in the `follow` method of the `Response` class. When `url` is None or an empty string, it should raise an exception instead of crawling the current page again.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug: Currently, the code does not handle the case where the `url` parameter is None or an empty string. When this happens, the code calls `self.urljoin(url)`, which may result in unexpected behavior.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: 
1. Add a check at the beginning of the `follow` method to raise an exception if the `url` parameter is None or an empty string.
2. Handle the case where the `url` parameter is None or an empty string by returning a default value or raising an exception.

Corrected Code:
```python
def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
           cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
           dont_filter=False, errback=None):
    if url is None or url == '':
        raise ValueError('The URL cannot be None or empty')

    if isinstance(url, Link):
        url = url.url
    url = self.urljoin(url)
    return Request(url, callback,
                   method=method,
                   headers=headers,
                   body=body,
                   cookies=cookies,
                   meta=meta,
                   encoding=encoding,
                   priority=priority,
                   dont_filter=dont_filter,
                   errback=errback)
```
In the corrected code, we added a check at the beginning of the `follow` method to raise a ValueError if the `url` parameter is None or an empty string. This will prevent the code from attempting to process an invalid URL and will provide a clear error message to the user.
