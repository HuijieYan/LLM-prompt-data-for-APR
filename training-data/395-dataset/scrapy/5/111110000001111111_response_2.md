The potential error location within the `follow` function is the `if isinstance(url, Link):` statement. This is likely causing the bug because it doesn't handle the case when `url` is an empty string or None, and it assumes `url` is an instance of `Link`.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle the cases when `url` is an empty string or None. When `url` is either of these values, it should not proceed to the `if isinstance(url, Link):` statement and instead raise an exception.

To fix the bug, we should add a check at the beginning of the `follow` function to handle the cases when `url` is an empty string or None. If `url` is empty or None, we should raise an exception indicating that the provided `url` is invalid.

Here's the corrected code for the `follow` function:

```python
def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
           cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
           dont_filter=False, errback=None):
    # type: (...) -> Request
    """
    Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
    It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
    but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
    not only an absolute URL.

    :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow` 
    method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
    and Link objects.
    """
    
    if url is None or url == '':
        raise ValueError("Invalid URL provided")
    
    if isinstance(url, Link):
        url = url.url
    url = self.urljoin(url)
    return Request(url, callback,
                   method=method,
                   headers=headers,
                   body=body,
                   cookies=cookies,
                   meta=meta,
                   encoding=encoding,
                   priority=priority,
                   dont_filter=dont_filter,
                   errback=errback)
```

With this correction, the `follow` function will now handle the cases when `url` is an empty string or None, and raise an exception indicating that the provided `url` is invalid.
