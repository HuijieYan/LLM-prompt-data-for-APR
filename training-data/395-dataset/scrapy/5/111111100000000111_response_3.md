Potential Error Location: The error might be occurring in the `follow` method, specifically with the logic for handling `url=''` or `None`.

Reasons behind the Bug: The current logic in the `follow` method does not handle the cases where `url` is an empty string or `None` properly. This leads to the base page being crawled again, which may not be the expected behavior.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the `url` is empty or `None` at the beginning of the `follow` method and raise an exception if so.
2. Add a conditional statement to handle the case where `url` is empty or `None` and return an appropriate response without crawling the base page again.

Here's the corrected code for the `follow` method:

```python
def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
           cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
           dont_filter=False, errback=None):
    if url is None or url == '':
        raise ValueError("Invalid url specified for follow")

    if isinstance(url, Link):
        url = url.url
    url = self.urljoin(url)
    return Request(url, callback,
                   method=method,
                   headers=headers,
                   body=body,
                   cookies=cookies,
                   meta=meta,
                   encoding=encoding,
                   priority=priority,
                   dont_filter=dont_filter,
                   errback=errback)
```

With this corrected code, the `follow` method will now raise a `ValueError` if `url` is empty or `None`, instead of crawling the base page again.
