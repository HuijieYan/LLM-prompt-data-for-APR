The potential error in the provided function is the use of the variable `Link` without importing it. Additionally, the function is missing the necessary import statements and definitions for the `Request` and `Link` classes.

The error in the test case is caused by the function `follow` not raising a `ValueError` when the input url is `None`.

To fix the bug, we need to import the required classes and make sure that the `follow` function properly raises a `ValueError` when the input url is `None`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function including the necessary imports:

```python
from scrapy.http import Request, Response
from scrapy.link import Link  

def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
           cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
           dont_filter=False, errback=None):
    # type: (...) -> Request
    """
    Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
    It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
    but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
    not only an absolute URL.
    
    :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow` 
    method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
    and Link objects.
    """
    if isinstance(url, Link):
        url = url.url
    else:
        if url is None:
            raise ValueError("URL cannot be None")
        
    url = self.urljoin(url)
    return Request(url, callback,
                   method=method,
                   headers=headers,
                   body=body,
                   cookies=cookies,
                   meta=meta,
                   encoding=encoding,
                   priority=priority,
                   dont_filter=dont_filter,
                   errback=errback)
``` 

With these changes, the function will properly handle the case where the input url is `None` and raise a `ValueError` as expected.
