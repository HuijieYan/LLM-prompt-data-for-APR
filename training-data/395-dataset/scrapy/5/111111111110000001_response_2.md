The error message indicates that the ValueError is not being raised by the follow method when None is passed as the url argument. This suggests that the follow method is not properly handling the case when None is passed as the url.

The potential error location within the follow method is likely the initial check for None and the handling of the url argument.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the follow method is not handling the case when None is passed as the url argument. This is leading to the AssertionError in the test case.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check at the beginning of the follow method to raise a ValueError if None is passed as the url argument. This will ensure that the method behaves as expected and raises the correct exception when needed.

Here's the corrected follow method:

```python
def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
           cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
           dont_filter=False, errback=None):
    # type: (...) -> Request
    """
    Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
    It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
    but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
    not only an absolute URL.

    :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow`
    method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
    and Link objects.
    """
    if url is None:
        raise ValueError("URL cannot be None")
    
    if isinstance(url, Link):
        url = url.url
    url = self.urljoin(url)
    return Request(url, callback,
                   method=method,
                   headers=headers,
                   body=body,
                   cookies=cookies,
                   meta=meta,
                   encoding=encoding,
                   priority=priority,
                   dont_filter=dont_filter,
                   errback=errback)
```

With this correction, the follow method will correctly raise a ValueError when None is passed as the url argument, fixing the bug identified in the test case.
