Potential error location:
The potential error location is the `follow` method within the `Response` class.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug is occurring because the `follow` method is not raising a `ValueError` when it receives a `None` value for the `url` parameter as indicated in the test case.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
We can fix the bug by adding a check for `None` value in the `url` parameter and raising a `ValueError` if it is indeed `None`.

Corrected code:

```python
class Response(object_ref):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # corrected follow method
    def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
               cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
               dont_filter=False, errback=None):
        # type: (...) -> Request
        """
        Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
        It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
        but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
        not only an absolute URL.
        
        :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow` 
        method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
        and Link objects.
        """
        if url is None:
            raise ValueError("Invalid URL: None")
        
        if isinstance(url, Link):
            url = url.url
        url = self.urljoin(url)
        return Request(url, callback,
                       method=method,
                       headers=headers,
                       body=body,
                       cookies=cookies,
                       meta=meta,
