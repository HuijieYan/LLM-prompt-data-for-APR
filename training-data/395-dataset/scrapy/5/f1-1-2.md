# buggy function docstring

```text
Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
not only an absolute URL.

:class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow` 
method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
and Link objects.
