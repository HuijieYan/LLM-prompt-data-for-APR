Potential error location: The error seems to be in the line `url = self.urljoin(url)` where the `urljoin` method is being called on `self`. However, `urljoin` is not defined within the `follow` method or its class.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `urljoin` method is being called on `self`, but it is not defined within the `follow` method or its class. This is causing the error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We can define the `urljoin` method within the class that contains the `follow` method, or we can import it from another module if available. Additionally, we need to handle the case when `url` is of type `Link` and extract the `url` property before further processing.

Corrected code:

```python
from scrapy.http.request import Request
from scrapy.link import Link

class YourClass:
    # other methods...

    def urljoin(self, url):
        # Define the urljoin method here, or import it from another module if available
        pass

    def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
               cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
               dont_filter=False, errback=None):
        # type: (...) -> Request
        """
        Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
        It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
        but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
        not only an absolute URL.
        
        :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow` 
        method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
        and Link objects.

        if isinstance(url, Link):  # Handle the case when url is of type Link
            url = url.url
        url = self.urljoin(url)  # Call the urljoin method defined in the class
        return Request(url, callback,
