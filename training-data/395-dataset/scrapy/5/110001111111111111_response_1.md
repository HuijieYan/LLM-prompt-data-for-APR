The error occurs when the function `follow` is called with `None` as the `url` parameter. The test case expects a `ValueError` to be raised in this scenario, but the function currently does not handle this case and does not raise a `ValueError`.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to the `follow` function to raise a `ValueError` when the `url` parameter is `None`. This check should be added at the beginning of the function before processing the `url`.

Here's the corrected code for the `follow` function:

```python
# corrected follow function
def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
           cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
           dont_filter=False, errback=None):
    # type: (...) -> Request
    """
    Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
    It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
    but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
    not only an absolute URL.

    :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow` 
    method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
    and Link objects.
    """
    if url is None:
        raise ValueError("Invalid URL: None")

    if isinstance(url, Link):
        url = url.url
    url = self.urljoin(url)
    return Request(url, callback,
                   method=method,
                   headers=headers,
                   body=body,
                   cookies=cookies,
                   meta=meta,
                   encoding=encoding,
                   priority=priority,
                   dont_filter=dont_filter,
                   errback=errback)
```

With this correction, the `follow` function will raise a `ValueError` when called with `None` as the `url` parameter, as expected by the test case.
