Potential error location: The error seems to be occurring in the test_follow_None_url test case, where it is expected that a ValueError should be raised when calling the follow method with a None url. However, the AssertionError indicates that the ValueError is not being raised.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug is likely occurring because the follow method is not properly handling the case when the url parameter is None. It should raise a ValueError in this case, but it currently does not do so.

Approach for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to add a check at the beginning of the follow method to raise a ValueError if the url parameter is None.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
           cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
           dont_filter=False, errback=None):
    # type: (...) -> Request
    """
    Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
    It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
    but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
    not only an absolute URL.

    :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow` 
    method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
    and Link objects.
    """
    if url is None:
        raise ValueError("URL cannot be None")
    
    if isinstance(url, Link):
        url = url.url
    url = self.urljoin(url)
    return Request(url, callback,
                   method=method,
                   headers=headers,
                   body=body,
                   cookies=cookies,
                   meta=meta,
                   encoding=encoding,
                   priority=priority,
                   dont_filter=dont_filter,
                   errback=errback)
```
