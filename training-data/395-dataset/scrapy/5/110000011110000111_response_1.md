The error is occurring due to the `follow` method not raising a ValueError when it is called with a `None` value for the `url`. The test case is expecting the `follow` method to raise a ValueError in this scenario, but it is not happening.

The potential error location within the `follow` method is the lack of handling for the case when the `url` is `None`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `follow` method is not checking for the `None` value of the `url` parameter and handling it appropriately.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check in the `follow` method to raise a ValueError if the `url` is `None`. This will satisfy the expectations of the test case.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
           cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
           dont_filter=False, errback=None):
    # type: (...) -> Request
    """
    Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
    It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
    but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
    not only an absolute URL.

    :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow`
    method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
    and Link objects.
    """
    if url is None:
        raise ValueError("URL cannot be None")
    
    if isinstance(url, Link):
        url = url.url
    url = self.urljoin(url)
    return Request(url, callback,
                   method=method,
                   headers=headers,
                   body=body,
                   cookies=cookies,
                   meta=meta,
                   encoding=encoding,
                   priority=priority,
                   dont_filter=dont_filter,
                   errback=errback)
```
