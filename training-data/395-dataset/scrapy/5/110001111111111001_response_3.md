Potential Error Location: The error is likely occurring in the `follow` function, specifically at the line `url = self.urljoin(url)`. 

Reason for the Bug: The `urljoin` method is being called as `self.urljoin`, but it should be called as `self.urljoin()`. This means that the `urljoin` method is not being executed correctly, resulting in the error when attempting to follow a `None` URL.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: 
1. Update the call to the `urljoin` method to `self.urljoin(url)`.
2. Check for `None` value for the `url` parameter and raise a `ValueError` if it is `None`.

Here's the corrected code for the `follow` function:

```python
def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
           cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
           dont_filter=False, errback=None):
    # type: (...) -> Request
    """
    Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
    It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
    but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
    not only an absolute URL.
    
    :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow` 
    method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
    and Link objects.
    """
    if url is None:
        raise ValueError("URL cannot be None")
    
    if isinstance(url, Link):
        url = url.url
    url = self.urljoin(url)  # Corrected the call to urljoin
    return Request(url, callback,
                   method=method,
                   headers=headers,
                   body=body,
                   cookies=cookies,
                   meta=meta,
                   encoding=encoding,
                   priority=priority,
                   dont_filter=dont_filter,
                   errback=errback)
```
