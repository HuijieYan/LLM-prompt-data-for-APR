The error is that the `follow` method does not handle the cases where the `url` parameter is an empty string or `None`. Instead of raising an exception, it tries to crawl the (base) page again, causing unexpected behavior.

The potential error location is within the if statement `if isinstance(url, Link):`, which should be checking for empty string or `None` values as well.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function does not properly handle the cases where the `url` parameter is empty or `None`, which leads to unexpected behavior and potential issues with data crawling.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check for empty string or `None` values in the `url` parameter, and raise an exception in those cases instead of trying to crawl the (base) page again.

Here is the corrected code for the `follow` method:

```python
def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
           cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
           dont_filter=False, errback=None):
    # type: (...) -> Request
    """
    Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
    It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
    but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
    not only an absolute URL.
    
    :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow` 
    method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
    and Link objects.
    """
    if url is None or url == '':
        raise ValueError("URL cannot be None or empty string")
    
    if isinstance(url, Link):
        url = url.url
    url = self.urljoin(url)
    return Request(url, callback,
                   method=method,
                   headers=headers,
                   body=body,
                   cookies=cookies,
                   meta=meta,
                   encoding=encoding,
                   priority=priority,
                   dont_filter=dont_filter,
                   errback=errback)
```

In the corrected code, we added a check for empty string or `None` values in the `url` parameter, and raise a `ValueError` exception in those cases. This will prevent the function from trying to crawl the (base) page again and ensure proper handling of invalid `url` values.
