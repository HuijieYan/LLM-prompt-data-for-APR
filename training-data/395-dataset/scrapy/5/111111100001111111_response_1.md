The potential error in the provided function is that it does not handle the case when the input parameter `url` is None or an empty string. This could lead to unexpected behavior, such as crawling the current page again, instead of raising an exception as expected.

The reason for the bug is that the function does not have proper input validation for the `url` parameter.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include adding input validation to check if the `url` parameter is None or an empty string, and raising an exception in such cases. This will prevent the function from crawling the current page again when it receives an invalid input for the `url` parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the `follow` function:

```python
def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
           cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
           dont_filter=False, errback=None):
    # type: (...) -> Request
    """
    Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
    It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
    but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
    not only an absolute URL.
    
    :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow` 
    method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
    and Link objects.
    """
    if url is None or url == '':
        raise ValueError("Invalid URL provided")
    
    if isinstance(url, Link):
        url = url.url
    url = self.urljoin(url)
    return Request(url, callback,
                   method=method,
                   headers=headers,
                   body=body,
                   cookies=cookies,
                   meta=meta,
                   encoding=encoding,
                   priority=priority,
                   dont_filter=dont_filter,
                   errback=errback)
```

In the corrected code, we added input validation to check if the `url` parameter is None or an empty string, and raise a ValueError in such cases. This will ensure that the function raises an exception instead of crawling the current page again with an invalid URL.
