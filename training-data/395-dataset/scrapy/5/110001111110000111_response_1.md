1. The test case is trying to test the behavior of the `follow` function when it is called with a `None` argument. The test is expecting a `ValueError` to be raised, but it is not being raised.

2. The potential error location within the `follow` function is where it accepts the `url` argument and processes it.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `follow` function does not handle the case when the `url` argument is `None`.

4. To fix the bug, we can add a check at the beginning of the `follow` function to raise a `ValueError` if the `url` argument is `None`. This will prevent the function from trying to process a `None` URL and raise the expected exception.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `follow` function:

```python
def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
           cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
           dont_filter=False, errback=None):
    # type: (...) -> Request
    """
    Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
    It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
    but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
    not only an absolute URL.
    
    :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow` 
    method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
    and Link objects.
    """
    if url is None:
        raise ValueError("URL cannot be None")

    if isinstance(url, Link):
        url = url.url
    url = self.urljoin(url)
    return Request(url, callback,
                   method=method,
                   headers=headers,
                   body=body,
                   cookies=cookies,
                   meta=meta,
                   encoding=encoding,
                   priority=priority,
                   dont_filter=dont_filter,
                   errback=errback)
```

With this correction, the `follow` function will now raise a `ValueError` if called with a `None` URL, as expected by the test case.
