The bug in the provided function `follow` is that it doesn't handle the case when the `url` argument is an empty string or None. This can lead to unintended behavior where the function tries to crawl the current page again if the `url` is empty or None.

To fix this bug, we can add a check at the beginning of the `follow` function to raise an exception when `url` is empty or None. This will prevent the function from trying to crawl the current page again in such cases.

Here's the corrected `follow` function:

```python
def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
           cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
          dont_filter=False, errback=None):
    # type: (...) -> Request
    """
    Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
    It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
    but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
    not only an absolute URL.

    :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow` 
    method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
    and Link objects.
    """
    if url is None or url == '':
        raise ValueError("The 'url' argument cannot be None or empty")
    
    if isinstance(url, Link):
        url = url.url
    url = self.urljoin(url)
    return Request(url, callback,
                   method=method,
                   headers=headers,
                   body=body,
                   cookies=cookies,
                   meta=meta,
                   encoding=encoding,
                   priority=priority,
                   dont_filter=dont_filter,
                   errback=errback)
```

With this correction, the `follow` function will now raise a ValueError if the `url` argument is None or an empty string, preventing the unintended behavior of crawling the current page again.
