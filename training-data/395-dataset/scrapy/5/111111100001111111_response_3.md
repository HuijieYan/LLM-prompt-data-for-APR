The potential error in the provided function is with the `url` parameter. If the `url` parameter is empty or `None`, the function will currently use `self.urljoin(url)` and return a request to crawl the current page again. This behavior might not be desired and can lead to unexpected results.

To fix this bug, the `follow` function should raise an exception when called with an empty or `None` url instead of crawling the current page again. This will make the behavior more explicit and prevent unexpected crawling.

Here's the corrected code for the `follow` function:

```python
def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
           cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
           dont_filter=False, errback=None):
    # type: (...) -> Request
    """
    Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
    It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
    but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
    not only an absolute URL.
    
    :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow` 
    method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
    and Link objects.
    """
    if url is None or url == '':
        raise ValueError("Invalid URL provided for the follow function")

    if isinstance(url, Link):
        url = url.url
    url = self.urljoin(url)
    return Request(url, callback,
                   method=method,
                   headers=headers,
                   body=body,
                   cookies=cookies,
                   meta=meta,
                   encoding=encoding,
                   priority=priority,
                   dont_filter=dont_filter,
                   errback=errback)
```

This corrected code will raise a `ValueError` if the `url` parameter is empty or `None`, making the behavior more explicit and preventing unexpected crawling.
