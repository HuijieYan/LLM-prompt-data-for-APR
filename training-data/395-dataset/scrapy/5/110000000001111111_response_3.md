The error message suggests that there is an issue with the `response.follow` function where it crawls the base page again when the URL is empty or None, instead of raising an exception.

The potential error location in the function is the `if isinstance(url, Link):` condition. This condition needs to be updated to also check if the `url` is empty or None, and raise an exception in those cases.

The reason behind the bug is that the function does not handle the cases of empty or None URLs, causing it to crawl the base page again instead of raising an exception.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to raise an exception when the `url` is empty or None, rather than proceeding to crawl the base page again.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
           cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
           dont_filter=False, errback=None):
    if url is None or url == '':
        raise ValueError("The URL cannot be empty or None")
    
    # type: (...) -> Request
    """
    Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
    It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
    but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
    not only an absolute URL.
    
    :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow` 
    method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
    and Link objects.
    """
    if isinstance(url, Link):
        url = url.url
    url = self.urljoin(url)
    return Request(url, callback,
                   method=method,
                   headers=headers,
                   body=body,
                   cookies=cookies,
                   meta=meta,
                   encoding=encoding,
                   priority=priority,
                   dont_filter=dont_filter,
                   errback=errback)
``` 

With this fix, the function will now raise a ValueError when the `url` is empty or None, instead of crawling the base page again.
