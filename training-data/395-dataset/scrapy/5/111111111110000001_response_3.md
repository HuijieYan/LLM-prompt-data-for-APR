The test case is trying to test the behavior of the `follow` method when it is called with a `None` value as the `url` parameter. The expected behavior is that it should raise a `ValueError`, but the test is failing because the `ValueError` is not being raised.

The potential error location within the `follow` method is the line `url = self.urljoin(url)`. In this line, the `urljoin` method is being called on the `self` object, but there is no `urljoin` method defined within the `Response` class.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `urljoin` method is being called on the `self` object, assuming that the method is defined within the class, but it is not actually defined.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `urljoin` method is correctly defined and accessible within the `Response` class. We can define the `urljoin` method within the `Response` class or make it accessible through an imported module.

Here is the corrected code for the `urljoin` method within the `Response` class:

```python
import urllib.parse

class Response(object_ref):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def urljoin(self, url):
        # method to join a base URL and a possibly relative URL
        return urllib.parse.urljoin(self.url, url)
        
    def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
               cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
               dont_filter=False, errback=None):
        # type: (...) -> Request
        """
        Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
        It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
        but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
        not only an absolute URL.
        
        :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow` 
        method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
        and Link objects.
        """
        if isinstance(url, Link):
            url = url.url
        url = self.urljoin(url)
        return Request(url, callback,
                       method=method,
                       headers=headers,
                       body=body,
                       cookies=cookies,
                       meta=meta,
                       encoding=encoding,
                       priority=priority,
                       dont_filter=dont_filter,
                       errback=errback)
```

With the `urljoin` method defined within the `Response` class, the `follow` method should now work as expected and the test case should pass without raising an `AssertionError`.
