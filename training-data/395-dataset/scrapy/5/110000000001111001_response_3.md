The potential error in the given function is with the 'self.urljoin(url)' line. This line is attempting to call a method 'urljoin' on the 'self' object, but it seems like 'self' is an instance of the 'Response' class and does not have the 'urljoin' method. 

Furthermore, there is a missing import statement for the 'Link' class, and the function does not have access to the 'Request' class.

To fix this bug, the following changes can be made:
1. Import the 'Link' and 'Request' classes if they are not already imported.
2. Use the available method to get the url, for example using 'self.url' instead of 'self.urljoin(url)'.
3. Provide a concrete example of 'Response.url' instead of a placeholder '<200 http://example.com>' for 'self'.
4. Add the appropriate import statement for the 'Link' class, assuming it is a part of some library or module.
5. Add an import statement for the 'Request' class, assuming it comes from a specific library or module.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
# Import statement for the Link class
from scrapy.link import Link
# Import statement for the Request class
from scrapy import Request

def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
           cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
           dont_filter=False, errback=None):
    # type: (...) -> Request
    """
    Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
    It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
    but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
    not only an absolute URL.
    
    :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow` 
    method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
    and Link objects.
    """
    if isinstance(url, Link):
        url = url.url
    # Using the available method to get the url
    url = self.url
    return Request(url, callback,
                   method=method,
                   headers=headers,
                   body=body,
                   cookies=cookies,
                   meta=meta,
                   encoding=encoding,
                   priority=priority,
                   dont_filter=dont_filter,
                   errback=errback)
