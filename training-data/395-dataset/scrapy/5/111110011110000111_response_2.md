1. The test case is checking if the ValueError is raised when `follow` is called with a `None` url. The error message indicates that the ValueError is not being raised as expected.

2. The potential error location within the `follow` function is the lack of handling for the case when the `url` parameter is `None`.

3. The bug occurs because the `follow` function does not have any check to handle the case when the `url` parameter is `None`. This causes the function to proceed with processing the `None` url, leading to unexpected behavior.

4. To fix the bug, a check for the `None` value of the `url` parameter should be added at the beginning of the `follow` function. If the `url` parameter is `None`, a ValueError should be raised to indicate that an invalid url was provided.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `follow` function:

```python
def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
           cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
           dont_filter=False, errback=None):
    # type: (...) -> Request
    if url is None:
        raise ValueError("Invalid url: None")
    
    if isinstance(url, Link):
        url = url.url
    url = self.urljoin(url)
    return Request(url, callback,
                   method=method,
                   headers=headers,
                   body=body,
                   cookies=cookies,
                   meta=meta,
                   encoding=encoding,
                   priority=priority,
                   dont_filter=dont_filter,
                   errback=errback)
```

With this correction, the `follow` function will now raise a ValueError when called with a `None` url, addressing the issue raised in the test case and the associated GitHub issue.
