The potential error in the `follow` method is that it does not raise a ValueError when the `url` parameter is `None`. This is evident from the test case `test_follow_None_url` which expects a ValueError to be raised when `None` is passed as the `url` parameter, but it is not being raised.

The bug occurs because the `follow` method does not handle the case when the `url` parameter is `None`.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check in the `follow` method to raise a ValueError when the `url` parameter is `None` or an empty string.

Here's the corrected `follow` method:

```python
def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
           cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
           dont_filter=False, errback=None):
    # type: (...) -> Request
    """
    Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
    It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
    but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
    not only an absolute URL.
    
    :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow` 
    method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
    and Link objects.
    """
    if url is None or url == '':
        raise ValueError("Invalid URL")
    
    if isinstance(url, Link):
        url = url.url
    url = self.urljoin(url)
    return Request(url, callback,
                   method=method,
                   headers=headers,
                   body=body,
                   cookies=cookies,
                   meta=meta,
                   encoding=encoding,
                   priority=priority,
                   dont_filter=dont_filter,
                   errback=errback)
```

With this correction, the `follow` method will now raise a ValueError when the `url` parameter is `None` or an empty string. This should address the issue reported in the test case and the associated GitHub issue.
