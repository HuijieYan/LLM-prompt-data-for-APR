The error occurs when the 'follow' method is called with a None value for the 'url' parameter in the test case. The error message indicates that a ValueError should be raised when 'follow' is called with a None value for the 'url' parameter, but it is not being raised.

The potential error location is within the 'follow' method where the input parameter 'url' is not being validated properly.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the 'follow' method does not have a check for the None value of the 'url' parameter before processing it.

To fix the bug, the 'follow' method should include a check for the None value of the 'url' parameter and raise a ValueError if it is None.

Here's the corrected code for the 'follow' method:

```python
def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
           cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
           dont_filter=False, errback=None):
    # type: (...) -> Request
    """
    Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
    It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
    but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
    not only an absolute URL.
    
    :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow` 
    method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
    and Link objects.
    """
    if url is None:
        raise ValueError("Invalid URL: None")
    
    if isinstance(url, Link):
        url = url.url
    url = self.urljoin(url)
    return Request(url, callback,
                   method=method,
                   headers=headers,
                   body=body,
                   cookies=cookies,
                   meta=meta,
                   encoding=encoding,
                   priority=priority,
                   dont_filter=dont_filter,
                   errback=errback)
```
