The bug in the provided code is that the follow function does not handle the cases where the url is empty or None. Instead of raising an exception in these cases, it proceeds to crawl the base page itself again, which is not the intended behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the follow function to check if the url is empty or None, and raise an exception in those cases.

Here's the corrected code for the follow function:

```python
def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
           cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
           dont_filter=False, errback=None):
    # type: (...) -> Request
    """
    Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
    It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
    but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
    not only an absolute URL.

    :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow` 
    method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
    and Link objects.
    """
    if url is None or url == '':
        raise ValueError("Invalid url: {}".format(url))
    
    if isinstance(url, Link):
        url = url.url
    url = self.urljoin(url)
    return Request(url, callback,
                   method=method,
                   headers=headers,
                   body=body,
                   cookies=cookies,
                   meta=meta,
                   encoding=encoding,
                   priority=priority,
                   dont_filter=dont_filter,
                   errback=errback)
```

With this modification, the follow function will now raise a ValueError if the url is empty or None, instead of proceeding to crawl the base page itself again.
