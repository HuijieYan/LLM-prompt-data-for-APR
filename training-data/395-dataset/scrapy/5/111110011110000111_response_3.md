1. The test case "test_follow_None_url" is trying to test the behavior of the "follow" method when called with a None value for the URL. The error message indicates that the ValueError is not being raised as expected.

2. The potential error location within the "follow" method is likely to be the conditional check for None value for the "url" parameter.

3. The bug is occurring because the "follow" method does not handle the case when the "url" parameter is None or an empty string. As a result, it does not raise a ValueError as expected when an invalid URL is provided.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the "follow" method to raise a ValueError when the "url" parameter is None or an empty string.

5. Corrected code for the "follow" method:

```python
def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
           cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
           dont_filter=False, errback=None):
    # type: (...) -> Request
    """
    Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
    It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
    but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
    not only an absolute URL.
    
    :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow` 
    method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
    and Link objects.
    """
    if url is None or url == '':
        raise ValueError("Invalid URL")
    
    if isinstance(url, Link):
        url = url.url
    url = self.urljoin(url)
    return Request(url, callback,
                   method=method,
                   headers=headers,
                   body=body,
                   cookies=cookies,
                   meta=meta,
                   encoding=encoding,
                   priority=priority,
                   dont_filter=dont_filter,
                   errback=errback)
```

With this correction, the "follow" method will now raise a ValueError when called with a None or empty string value for the "url" parameter, resolving the issue reported in the test case and the associated GitHub issue.
