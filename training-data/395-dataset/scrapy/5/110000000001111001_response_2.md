The potential error is the line `url = self.urljoin(url)`. The error is likely occurring because the `urljoin` function is being called as a method of `self`, which is an instance of the `Response` class, without passing the `url` parameter. This will result in a TypeError.

To fix this bug, we should call the `urljoin` method on the `self` instance, passing the `url` parameter as an argument.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected function
def follow(self, url, callback=None, method='GET', headers=None, body=None,
           cookies=None, meta=None, encoding='utf-8', priority=0,
           dont_filter=False, errback=None):
    # type: (...) -> Request
    """
    Return a :class:`~.Request` instance to follow a link ``url``.
    It accepts the same arguments as ``Request.__init__`` method,
    but ``url`` can be a relative URL or a ``scrapy.link.Link`` object,
    not only an absolute URL.
    
    :class:`~.TextResponse` provides a :meth:`~.TextResponse.follow` 
    method which supports selectors in addition to absolute/relative URLs
    and Link objects.
    """
    if isinstance(url, Link):
        url = url.url
    url = self.urljoin(url, method)
    return Request(url, callback,
                   method=method,
                   headers=headers,
                   body=body,
                   cookies=cookies,
                   meta=meta,
                   encoding=encoding,
                   priority=priority,
                   dont_filter=dont_filter,
                   errback=errback)

```
In the corrected code, we have added the `method` parameter when calling the `urljoin` method on the `self` instance. This should resolve the error and provide the expected outcome.
