Potential error location: The error may be occurring in the _set_url method of the Request class, particularly in the type checking and url manipulation.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the _set_url method does not properly handle invalid URL inputs. Instead of raising an error when an invalid URL is passed, the method silently ignores the error, leading to unexpected behavior.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: The _set_url method should include proper error handling for invalid URL inputs, such as raising an error with a descriptive message when an invalid URL is provided.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _set_url(self, url):
        if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
            raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)
        
        try:
            parsed_url = urlparse(url)
            if not all([parsed_url.scheme, parsed_url.netloc]):
                raise ValueError('Invalid URL format: %s' % url)
        except Exception as e:
            raise ValueError('Invalid URL format: %s' % url) from e
        
        s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)
        self._url = escape_ajax(s)
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to ensure that the URL is in a valid format using the urlparse function, and we raise a ValueError if the URL is invalid. We also added a try-except block to capture any exceptions during the URL parsing and re-raise them as a ValueError with the original URL information. This will allow the error to be properly handled and logged when an invalid URL is provided.
