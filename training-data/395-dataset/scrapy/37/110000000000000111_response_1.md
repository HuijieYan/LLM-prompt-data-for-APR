The error in the provided function is that it does not properly handle the case where an invalid URL is passed to it. 

The error message in the GitHub issue indicates that when an invalid URL is passed to `scrapy.Request()`, instead of raising an error, it silently ignores the error and continues execution.

The potential error location within the function is the lack of proper validation for the URL being passed. 

The bug occurs because the function does not have a check in place to handle invalid URLs.

To fix the bug, the function should validate the URL being passed and raise an error if it is invalid. The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
import six

def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)

    s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)
    self._url = escape_ajax(s)

    if ':' not in self._url:
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % self._url)
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to ensure that the URL is a string or unicode, and if it is not, it raises a `TypeError`. Additionally, we kept the existing check to ensure that the URL contains a scheme.
