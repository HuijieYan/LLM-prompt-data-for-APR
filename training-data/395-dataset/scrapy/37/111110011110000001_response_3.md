The test_url_no_scheme function is testing whether the ValueError is raised when an invalid URL without a scheme is passed to the _set_url method of the Request class. The test case is checking for three scenarios: 'foo', '/foo/', and '/foo:bar'. The first two scenarios correctly raise a ValueError, but the third one does not.

The potential error location within the _set_url method is the condition "if ':' not in self._url:", which is used to check if a scheme is present in the URL. If the scheme is missing, a ValueError should be raised.

The bug is occurring because the _set_url method is not correctly identifying the absence of a scheme in the provided URL when there is a colon present in the URL path (as in the '/foo:bar' test scenario).

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic that checks for the presence of a scheme in the URL. We need to consider only the substring until the first occurrence of '/', which indicates the end of the scheme if present.

Here's the corrected code for the _set_url method:

```python
import six
from urllib.parse import urlparse

class Request(object_ref):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def encoding(self):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # this is the corrected function
    def _set_url(self, url):
        if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
            raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)
    
        s = urlparse(url)
        if s.scheme == '':
            raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % s.geturl())
        
        self._url = escape_ajax(url)
```

With this corrected code, the _set_url method will now correctly identify the absence of a scheme in the provided URL.
