The test case `test_url_no_scheme` is checking if the `ValueError` is raised when an invalid URL without a scheme is passed to the `Request` class. The third `assertRaises` call is not raising the expected `ValueError` and therefore failing the test.

The potential error location within the `_set_url` method is the `if ':' not in self._url` condition, which is checking if the URL contains a scheme.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `_set_url` method does not handle URLs without a scheme properly and is not raising the `ValueError` when it should.

To fix the bug, the `_set_url` method should be modified to properly handle URLs without a scheme and raise the `ValueError` accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_set_url` method:

```python
import six

class Request(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def encoding(self):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # this is the corrected _set_url method
    def _set_url(self, url):
        if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
            raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)

        if '://' not in url:
            raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % url)

        self._url = url
```

In the corrected code, instead of checking for the presence of a colon (':') in the URL, we are checking for the presence of '://' in the URL to ensure a valid scheme. If the scheme is missing, we raise a `ValueError` with the appropriate message.
