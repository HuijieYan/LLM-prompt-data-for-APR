1. The test case is checking if a ValueError is raised when the request_class is called with an invalid URL that does not contain a scheme.
2. The potential error location within the _set_url function is the if statement that checks if ':' is not in self._url, which is used to validate the URL scheme.
3. The bug occurs because the _set_url function does not properly handle invalid URLs that do not contain a scheme. Instead of raising a ValueError as expected, it fails to do so, leading to the silent acceptance of invalid URLs.
4. To fix the bug, the _set_url function should be modified to properly handle invalid URLs by raising a ValueError if the URL does not contain a scheme.
5. Here's the corrected code for the _set_url function:

```python
def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)

    s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)
    self._url = escape_ajax(s)

    if '://' not in self._url:  # Check for the presence of the scheme
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % self._url)
```

By checking for the presence of the scheme using '://', the _set_url function will now properly handle invalid URLs and raise a ValueError as expected.
