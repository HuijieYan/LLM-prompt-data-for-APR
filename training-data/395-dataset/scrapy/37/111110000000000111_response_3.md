Potential error location: The error seems to be occurring in the _set_url method of the Request class, specifically in the if statement checking for the presence of a ':' in the url.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug occurs because the _set_url method does not properly handle invalid or unexpected urls. Instead of crashing loudly and indicating the error, it just silently ignores the error, leading to unexpected behavior.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We need to modify the _set_url method to properly handle invalid urls and raise informative error messages when necessary.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import six

# class declaration containing the corrected function
class Request(object_ref):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def _set_url(self, url):
        if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
            raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)
        
        if 'http' not in url:
            raise ValueError('Invalid url scheme in request url: %s' % url)

        self._url = url
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the url is a string or unicode using isinstance. Then we check if the url contains the 'http' scheme, and if it does not, we raise a ValueError with an informative error message. This will ensure that invalid urls are properly handled and appropriate error messages are raised.
