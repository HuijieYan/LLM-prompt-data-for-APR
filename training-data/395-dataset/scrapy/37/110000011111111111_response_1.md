This bug is related to the `scrapy.Request` class not raising a `ValueError` when an invalid URL is passed to it.

Upon analyzing the test case and its relationship with the error message, it is clear that the `test_url_no_scheme` test is expecting a `ValueError` to be raised when an invalid URL without a scheme is passed. However, the `scrapy.Request` class is not raising this error, leading to the test failure.

The potential error location within the `_set_url` function is the check for the presence of a scheme in the URL. The function should be checking for the existence of a scheme in the URL and raising a `ValueError` if it is missing.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `_set_url` function is not correctly validating the URL and raising a `ValueError` when a scheme is missing.

To fix the bug, the `_set_url` function should be modified to correctly validate the URL and raise a `ValueError` when a scheme is missing.

Here is the corrected code for the `_set_url` function:

```python
import six

def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)

    s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)
    self._url = escape_ajax(s)

    if '://' not in self._url:  # Check for the presence of scheme
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % self._url)
```

With this correction, the `_set_url` function will now correctly check for the presence of a scheme in the URL and raise a `ValueError` if it is missing. This should address the issue reported in the test case and the associated GitHub issue.
