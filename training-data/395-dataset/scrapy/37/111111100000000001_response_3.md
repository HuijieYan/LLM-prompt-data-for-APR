Potential error location: 
The error occurs in the `_set_url` method, where it checks if the URL is a string using `isinstance`. However, the correct way to check for string types is by using `isinstance(url, str)` in Python 3.x.

Reasons behind the bug:
The bug occurs because the code is written for Python 2.x, where the `six.string_types` can be used to check for both `str` and `unicode` types. However, in Python 3.x, the `str` type replaces the need for `unicode` and should be checked directly using `isinstance(url, str)`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to replace the use of `six.string_types` with `str` directly to check for a string type.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
# this is the corrected function
def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, str):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)
    
    s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding())
    self._url = escape_ajax(s)
    
    if ':' not in self._url:
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % self._url)
```
