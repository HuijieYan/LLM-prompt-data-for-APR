The bug is likely located in the `_set_url` function in the class `Request` in the file `/Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_37/scrapy/http/request/__init__.py`. The function appears to be incorrectly handling URLs without a scheme.

The error message from the test function indicates that a `ValueError` is not being raised by the `Request` class when an invalid URL without a scheme is passed to it.

The bug is likely occurring because the `_set_url` function is not properly handling URLs without a scheme, and as a result, it is not raising the `ValueError` as expected.

One possible approach to fix this bug is to modify the `_set_url` function to check for the presence of a scheme in the URL. If the scheme is missing, it should raise a `ValueError` indicating that the scheme is missing in the request URL.

Here's the corrected `_set_url` function:

```python
def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)
    
    s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)
    self._url = escape_ajax(s)
    
    if ':' not in urlparse(self._url).scheme:
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % self._url)
```

In this corrected version of the function, we are using the `urlparse` function from the `urllib.parse` module to check for the presence of a scheme in the URL. If the scheme is missing, it will raise a `ValueError` as expected.

After making this change, the `Request` class should properly handle URLs without a scheme and raise a `ValueError` when necessary.
