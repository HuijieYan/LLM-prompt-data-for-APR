The test case `test_url_no_scheme` is checking if a ValueError is raised when an invalid URL without a scheme is passed to the `request_class` constructor. The first two assertions are passing, but the third one is failing to raise a ValueError.

The potential error location within the `_set_url` function is the condition `if ':' not in self._url`. If the URL doesn't contain a scheme (e.g., 'http://'), this condition will always evaluate to True, causing the ValueError not to be raised.

The bug occurs because the function is not properly checking for the presence of a scheme in the URL before raising a ValueError. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition that checks for the presence of a scheme in the URL. We should also remove the unnecessary `encoding` method as it does not serve any purpose and does not have a proper implementation.

Here's the corrected code for the `_set_url` function:

```python
def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)

    if not urlparse(url).scheme:
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % url)
    
    self._url = escape_ajax(url)
```

This code first checks if the URL has a scheme using the `urlparse` function. If not, it raises a ValueError. Otherwise, it sets the `_url` attribute to the escaped URL.
