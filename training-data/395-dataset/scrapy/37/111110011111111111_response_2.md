The test case "test_url_no_scheme" is trying to check if the ValueError is raised when the request_class is called with an invalid URL that does not contain a scheme (e.g., 'http://' or 'https://'). The test case is expecting the ValueError to be raised, but it is not being raised, leading to test failure.

The potential error in the function "_set_url" is the condition "if ':' not in self._url:", which is checking if the URL contains a scheme, but it should be checking if the original URL passed to the function contains a scheme.

The reason behind the bug is that the function "_set_url" is not correctly validating the input URL and is raising the ValueError in the wrong place.

To fix the bug, the function "_set_url" should check if the original URL passed to the function contains a scheme instead of checking the modified URL stored in "self._url." Also, proper error handling needs to be implemented to raise the ValueError in the expected scenario.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)

    if ':' not in url:
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % url)

    s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)
    self._url = escape_ajax(s)
```

With this corrected code, the function will properly check the original URL for the presence of a scheme and raise the ValueError if it is missing.
