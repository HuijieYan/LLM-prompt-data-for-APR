The error message from the test function indicates that a ValueError is not being raised by the Request class when an invalid URL without a scheme (e.g., '/foo:bar') is provided. This suggests that the _set_url function within the Request class is not properly validating URLs.

The potential error location is within the _set_url function, specifically in the if ':' not in self._url check. This check is meant to ensure that the URL contains a scheme (e.g., 'http:', 'https:'), but it's incorrectly throwing a ValueError for URLs that contain a colon in a different context (e.g., '/foo:bar').

The bug occurs because the _set_url function incorrectly assumes that any colon in the URL is indicating the presence of a scheme, which leads to incorrectly raising a ValueError for URLs that are actually relative paths.

To fix the bug, the _set_url function should be updated to correctly validate the URL and raise a ValueError only if the URL does not include a valid scheme.

Here's the corrected code for the _set_url function:

```python
def _set_url(self, url):
        if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
            raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)
    
        s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)
        self._url = escape_ajax(s)
    
        # Check if the URL has a valid scheme
        parsed = urlparse(self._url)
        if not (parsed.scheme and parsed.netloc):
            raise ValueError('Missing scheme or network location in request url: %s' % self._url)
```

With this change, the _set_url function will correctly validate the URL and only raise a ValueError if the URL is missing a valid scheme or network location. This should address the issue reported in the test function and the associated GitHub issue.
