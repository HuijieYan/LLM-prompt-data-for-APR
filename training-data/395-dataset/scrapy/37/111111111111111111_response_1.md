The test case "test_url_no_scheme" is checking for a ValueError to be raised when an invalid URL is passed to the "Request" class. The third instance of the test case is failing because the ValueError is not being raised as expected.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the "_set_url" method. This method is responsible for setting the URL and checking if it contains a scheme. If the scheme is missing, it raises a ValueError.

The bug occurs because the URL validation logic inside the "_set_url" method is not working as intended. As a result, the ValueError is not being raised when it should be.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the URL validation logic inside the "_set_url" method correctly checks for the presence of a scheme and raises a ValueError if it's missing.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:
```python
def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)

    s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding())
    self._url = escape_ajax(s)

    if '://' not in self._url:
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % self._url)
```
In the corrected code, the call to "self.encoding" has been changed to "self.encoding()" to properly invoke the method. Additionally, the validation for the presence of a scheme in the URL has been corrected to "if '://' not in self._url" to ensure that the ValueError is raised as expected.
