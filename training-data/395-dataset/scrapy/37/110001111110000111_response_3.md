The test_url_no_scheme function is testing the case where an invalid URL is passed to the request_class. The test passes two invalid URLs and expects the ValueError to be raised. However, for the URL '/foo:bar', the test fails, and the AssertionError is raised because the ValueError is not being raised by the Request class.

The bug is located in the _set_url method of the Request class. The bug occurs because the method is not properly handling the case where the URL is missing the scheme. The method is supposed to check if the URL contains the scheme and raise a ValueError if it's missing. However, it's not performing this check correctly, leading to the ValueError not being raised.

To fix the bug, the _set_url method should be modified to ensure that it checks for the presence of the scheme in the URL and raises a ValueError if it's missing.

here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)

    s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)
    self._url = escape_ajax(s)

    if '://' not in self._url:
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % self._url)
```
