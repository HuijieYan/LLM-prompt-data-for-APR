The error message from the test function "test_url_no_scheme" indicates that a ValueError was not raised by the Request class when provided with the url '/foo:bar'. This suggests that the _set_url method inside the Request class is not properly raising the ValueError when the URL is missing the scheme.

The potential error location is inside the _set_url method, specifically in the condition where it checks for the presence of ':' in the URL.

The bug occurs because the _set_url method does not properly validate the URL to ensure it contains a scheme (e.g., http:// or https://). Without a scheme, the URL is considered invalid, which should result in a ValueError being raised.

To fix the bug, the _set_url method needs to be modified to properly validate the URL and raise a ValueError if the scheme is missing.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)

    if ':' not in urlparse(url).scheme:
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % url)

    s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)
    self._url = escape_ajax(s)
```

In this corrected code, the urlparse function is used to extract the scheme from the URL. If the scheme is missing, a ValueError is raised. This ensures that the URL is properly validated before being set in the Request object.
