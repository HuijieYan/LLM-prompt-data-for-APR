It seems that the test case `test_url_no_scheme` is trying to create a `Request` object with an invalid URL that does not contain a scheme (e.g., "http://"). This is leading to the `ValueError` not being raised by the `Request` class, which is the source of the bug.

The bug is occurring within the `_set_url` method of the `Request` class. The method is not correctly checking for the presence of a scheme in the URL, and as a result, it fails to raise a `ValueError` when an invalid URL is provided.

The bug occurs because the `_set_url` method does not perform a thorough check on the provided URL to ensure it contains a valid scheme. As a result, URLs without a scheme, such as '/foo', '/foo/', and '/foo:bar', are mistakenly accepted, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the `_set_url` method should be modified to validate the URL and raise a `ValueError` if the provided URL does not contain a valid scheme.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic `_set_url` method:

```python
def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)

    s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)
    self._url = escape_ajax(s)

    # Validate the URL to ensure it contains a scheme
    parsed_url = urlparse(self._url)
    if not parsed_url.scheme:
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % self._url)
```

With this corrected code, the `_set_url` method will now properly validate the URL to ensure it contains a scheme and appropriately raise a `ValueError` if an invalid URL is provided.
