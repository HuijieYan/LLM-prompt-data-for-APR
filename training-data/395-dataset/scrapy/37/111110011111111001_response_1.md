Potential error location: The bug seems to be occurring in the `_set_url` method of the `Request` class.

Reason behind the bug: The bug occurs because the `_set_url` method is not properly validating the URL before assigning it to the `_url` attribute. As a result, the test case `test_url_no_scheme` is not raising a `ValueError` as expected.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check whether the URL has a scheme before assigning it to the `_url` attribute.
2. Properly handle the case where the URL does not have a scheme by raising a `ValueError` and providing a more informative error message.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)

    if ':' not in url:
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % url)

    s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)
    self._url = escape_ajax(s)
```
