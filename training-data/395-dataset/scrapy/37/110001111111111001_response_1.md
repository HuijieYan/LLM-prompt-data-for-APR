The test case `test_url_no_scheme` is trying to validate if the ValueError is being raised by the `self.request_class` function when the URL provided does not contain a scheme (e.g., 'http://'). The test passes for URLs like 'foo' and '/foo/' but fails for '/foo:bar', meaning that the specific ValueError is not being raised in this case.

The potential error location within the `_set_url` function is the conditional check `if ':' not in self._url`. This check is supposed to ensure that a valid scheme is present in the URL, but it is not correctly handling URLs without schemes (resulting in ValueError not being raised).

The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle URLs without schemes. The conditional check only checks for the presence of ':' in the URL, which is not a sufficient validation for a URL with a scheme.

To fix the bug, the `_set_url` function needs to be updated to appropriately handle URLs without schemes and raise a ValueError when necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the `_set_url` function:
```python
def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)

    s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)
    self._url = escape_ajax(s)

    parsed_url = urlparse(self._url)
    if not all([parsed_url.scheme, parsed_url.netloc]):
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme or network location in request url: %s' % self._url)
```

With this correction, the `_set_url` function will now properly validate the URL and raise a ValueError if the scheme or network location is missing.
