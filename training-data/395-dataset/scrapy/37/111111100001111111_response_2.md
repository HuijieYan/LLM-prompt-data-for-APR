The issue seems to be related to the `Request` class not raising an error when an invalid URL is passed to it.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `_set_url` method, specifically in the line `if ':' not in self._url:` where it checks if the URL contains a scheme (such as http://). If it doesn't contain a scheme, it raises a ValueError.

The bug occurs because the `_set_url` method does not handle the case where an invalid URL is passed. It only checks for the presence of a scheme in the URL but does not handle cases where the URL itself is invalid. As a result, when an invalid URL is passed, the function does not raise the expected error.

To fix the bug, the `_set_url` method needs to handle the case where an invalid URL is passed and raise an error accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_set_url` method:

```python
def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, six.string_types) or not url:
        raise ValueError('Invalid URL: %s' % url)
    
    if ':' not in url:
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % url)
    
    s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)
    self._url = escape_ajax(s)
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the URL is a valid string and not empty. If it's invalid, we raise a ValueError. Then we proceed to check if the URL contains a scheme and continue with the rest of the function as before. This will ensure that when an invalid URL is passed, an error is raised as expected.
