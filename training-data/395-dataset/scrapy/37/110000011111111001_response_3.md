Potential Error:

The potential error location within the problematic function is at the line:
```python
if ':' not in self._url:
    raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % self._url)
```

Reasons behind the Bug:

The bug occurs because the function raises a ValueError if the URL does not contain a colon (':'), which is commonly used to separate the scheme from the rest of the URL. However, the test case `self.request_class, '/foo:bar'` is expected to raise a ValueError, indicating that the function incorrectly treats the URL '/foo:bar' as having a missing scheme.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:

Instead of checking for the presence of a colon (':'), the function should check whether the URL starts with a valid scheme (e.g., http, https, ftp, etc.). This will identify URLs that are missing a scheme and raise a ValueError accordingly.

Corrected Code:

```python
import six
from urllib.parse import urlsplit

def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)

    scheme = urlsplit(url).scheme
    if not scheme:
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % url)

    s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)
    self._url = escape_ajax(s)
```

In this corrected code, the `urlsplit` function is used to parse the URL and extract the scheme. If the scheme is missing (i.e., an empty string), a ValueError is raised. This approach accurately identifies URLs with missing schemes and resolves the bug.
