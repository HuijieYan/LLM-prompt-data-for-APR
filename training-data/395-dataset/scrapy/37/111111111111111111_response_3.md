The error message from the test function indicates that the ValueError is not being raised by the Request class, specifically for the invalid URL '/foo:bar'.

Upon analyzing the code, it seems that the _set_url method is responsible for validating the URL and raising a ValueError if the URL doesn't contain a scheme. However, there seems to be an issue with the validation logic in this method.

The buggy function validates the URL using the condition if ':' not in self._url, which is incorrect. This condition is checking for the presence of a colon in the _url attribute, but it should be checking for the scheme (like 'http:', 'ftp:', etc.). This is the reason for the incorrect validation and the subsequent failure to raise a ValueError for the provided invalid URL '/foo:bar'.

To fix this bug, the validation logic in the _set_url method should be updated to correctly check for the presence of a scheme in the URL.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)

    s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)
    self._url = escape_ajax(s)

    # Check for the presence of a scheme in the URL
    if not urlparse(self._url).scheme:
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % self._url)
```

By using the urlparse function from the urllib.parse module, the corrected code checks for the presence of a scheme in the URL. This fix ensures that the ValueError is raised for URLs that do not contain a valid scheme.
