Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the `_set_url` method of the Request class in the `__init__.py` file. The method is attempting to set the URL for the request and performing some validation checks.

Reason behind the bug: The bug is occurring because the `_set_url` method is not handling invalid URLs properly. When an invalid URL is passed to the Request constructor, it should raise an error or at least log the issue, but it currently does not do so.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We need to modify the `_set_url` method to handle invalid URLs properly. This can be done by adding an additional check for invalid URLs and raising an error if the URL is invalid.

Corrected code:

```python
# Corrected _set_url method
def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)

    s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)
    self._url = escape_ajax(s)

    if ':' not in self._url:
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % self._url)
```

With this corrected code, if an invalid URL is passed to the Request constructor, it will raise an error and provide information about the issue, making it easier to debug and fix the problem.
