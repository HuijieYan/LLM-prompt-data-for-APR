Potential error location: The error is most likely occurring in the isinstance() check for the url variable.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug is likely occurring because the 'six' module is not being imported in the function. As a result, the 'six.string_types' is not accessible and causing an error.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Import the 'six' module at the beginning of the file to make the 'six.string_types' available.
2. Check if the 'url' is a string using the 'isinstance()' method, and if not, raise a TypeError.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import six

def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, (str, six.text_type)):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)

    s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)
    self._url = escape_ajax(s)

    if ':' not in self._url:
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % self._url)
```
