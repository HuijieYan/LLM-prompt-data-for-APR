The error in the code is due to the function `_set_url` not being properly defined. It should be indented under the class and have `self` as its first parameter.

To fix the bug, the `_set_url` function should be properly indented and have `self` as its first parameter.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_37/scrapy/http/request/__init__.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def encoding(self):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

class ClassName:
    # corrected function
    def _set_url(self, url):
        if not isinstance(url, str):
            raise TypeError('Request url must be str, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)
        
        s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)
        self._url = escape_ajax(s)
        
        if ':' not in self._url:
            raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % self._url)
```
