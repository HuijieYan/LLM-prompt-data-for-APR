# Corrected function/method
```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class Request(object_ref):
    # ... omitted code ...


    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def encoding(self):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass



    # this is the corrected function
    def _set_url(self, url):
        if not isinstance(url, str):
            raise TypeError('Request url must be str, got %s' % type(url).__name__)
    
        s = self.safe_url_string(url, self.encoding())
        self._url = self.escape_ajax(s)
    
        if ':' not in self._url:
            raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % self._url)
```
In the corrected function, I made the following changes:
1. Changed `six.string_types` to just `str` since `six.string_types` is not a valid data type in Python.
2. Replaced `safe_url_string` with `self.safe_url_string` to access the method within the class.
3. Replaced `escape_ajax` with `self.escape_ajax` to access the method within the class.

With these changes, the function should work properly and the test should pass without any assertion errors.
