1. The test case is checking if a ValueError is raised when creating a Request with a URL that is missing the scheme. The test passes valid URLs as well as an invalid URL '/foo:bar' to the request_class.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the _set_url method, specifically the if ':' not in self._url condition.

3. The bug occurs because the _set_url method does not raise a ValueError when the URL is missing the scheme. This results in the silent ignoring of the error when creating a Request with an invalid URL.

4. One approach to fixing the bug is to modify the _set_url method to raise a ValueError when the scheme is missing in the URL.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)

    s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)
    self._url = escape_ajax(s)

    if '://' not in self._url:  # Check for the presence of the scheme in the URL
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % self._url)
```
