Potential Error Location:
The error in the provided function `_set_url` is likely to occur at the `if ':' not in self._url` condition. If the input `url` does not contain a scheme (e.g., http:// or https://), then this condition will raise a ValueError.

Reasons Behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not handle invalid URLs gracefully. Instead of throwing an error when an invalid URL is provided, it silently ignores the error and continues execution, leading to unexpected behavior.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Validate the input URL to ensure it contains a valid scheme before assigning it to `self._url`.
2. Raise explicit exceptions for invalid URLs to provide detailed error messages for debugging.

```python
# Corrected function
import six

def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)

    if ':' not in url:
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % url)

    s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)
    self._url = escape_ajax(s)
```

By validating the `url` for containing a scheme before further processing, this corrected function ensures that the URL is in the expected format. If the URL is invalid, an explicit `ValueError` is raised with a descriptive error message, allowing for easier debugging and problem resolution.
