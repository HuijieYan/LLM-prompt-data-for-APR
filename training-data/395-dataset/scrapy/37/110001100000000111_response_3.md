Potential Error Location:
The error is likely occurring within the _set_url function, specifically when checking if the URL has a valid scheme.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because the _set_url function does not properly handle invalid URLs. When an invalid URL is passed to the Request object, it does not raise an exception or provide any error information. This leads to silent failure, making it difficult for the user to identify and debug the issue.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Add proper error handling to the _set_url function to raise an exception when an invalid URL is detected.
2. Provide more informative error messages or log the error details to help the user understand the issue.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)

    s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)
    self._url = escape_ajax(s)

    if '://' not in self._url:  # Check for the scheme in the URL
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % self._url)
```
In the corrected code, we added a check for the scheme in the URL using '://' as the indicator. If the scheme is missing, a ValueError is raised to indicate the issue with the URL, providing more transparency and a clear error message for the user.
