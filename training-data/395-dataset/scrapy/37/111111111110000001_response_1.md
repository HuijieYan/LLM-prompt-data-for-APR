Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the `_set_url` method within the `Request` class, where it checks for the presence of a scheme in the provided URL.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The error is likely occurring because the method `_set_url` is not correctly handling URLs that do not contain a scheme (e.g., 'http', 'https').

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: We can modify the `_set_url` method to handle URLs without a scheme by either adding a default scheme (e.g., 'http') if one is missing, or by raising a more specific error message to guide the user on the expected URL format.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, str):  # Use 'str' instead of 'six.string_types'
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)

    if '://' not in url:  # Check for the presence of scheme
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % url)

    self._url = url  # No need to escape or modify the URL here
```

In this corrected code, the method now checks for the presence of a scheme in the URL and raises a specific error if it is missing. It also removes unnecessary processing of the URL, which should be handled elsewhere in the code.
