Potential error location: The if statement "if ':' not in self._url:" is checking if a ":" is present in the URL, but it doesn't consider the case where the URL is empty or None. This could lead to a ValueError being raised even if the URL is invalid.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where the URL is empty or None. This results in a ValueError being raised, but the error is not properly handled and does not provide useful information to the user.

Approach for fixing the bug: 
1. Check if the URL is empty or None before performing any other checks.
2. If the URL is empty or None, raise a ValueError with a meaningful error message.
3. If the URL is not empty or None, proceed with the other checks.

Corrected code:

```python
def _set_url(self, url):
    if url is None or url == "":
        raise ValueError('URL cannot be empty or None')

    if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)

    s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)
    self._url = escape_ajax(s)

    if ':' not in self._url:
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % self._url)
```
This corrected code first checks if the URL is empty or None, and raises a ValueError with a meaningful error message if this is the case. It then proceeds with the other checks.
