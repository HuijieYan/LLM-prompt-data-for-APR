The bug occurs in the `_set_url` method of the `Request` class. The method is supposed to set the URL for the Request object, but it has a bug that causes it to silently ignore errors when an invalid URL is provided to it.

The potential error location is in the line `if ':' not in self._url:`. This line checks if the URL contains a colon (':'), which is typically used to separate the scheme from the rest of the URL. However, the bug occurs when an invalid URL is provided, and the method fails to raise an error or provide any information about the invalid URL.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the method does not handle the case of an invalid URL properly. It should raise an error or log the issue when an invalid URL is provided, but it currently fails to do so.

To fix the bug, the `_set_url` method should be modified to explicitly raise an error or log the issue when an invalid URL is provided. This will help in identifying and handling the issue when it occurs.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from scrapy.utils.python import to_unicode
from scrapy.utils.url import escape_ajax, safe_url_string
from six import string_types

class Request(object_ref):
    # ... other methods ...

    def _set_url(self, url):
        if not isinstance(url, string_types):
            raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)

        # Handle the invalid URL by raising an error
        try:
            s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)
            self._url = escape_ajax(s)
        except Exception as e:
            raise ValueError('Invalid url: %s' % url)

        if ':' not in self._url:
            raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % self._url)
```

With this fix, the `_set_url` method now properly handles the case of an invalid URL by raising a ValueError. This will help in identifying and handling the issue when it occurs.
