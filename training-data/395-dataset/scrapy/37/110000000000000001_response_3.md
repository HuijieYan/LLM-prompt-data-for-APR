Potential error location:
The error is likely related to the check for the presence of a colon (':') in the URL. If the colon is not present, a ValueError is raised.

Reason for the bug:
The bug occurs because the function is not handling URLs that do not contain a scheme (e.g., 'http://'). The presence of a scheme is typically denoted by the presence of a colon in the URL.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we can modify the function to handle URLs without a scheme by adding a default scheme if none is present.

Corrected code:
```python
import six
from urllib.parse import urlparse

def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)

    if urlparse(url).scheme:
        self._url = url
    else:
        self._url = "http://" + url
    
    # Perform any additional processing as needed
```
