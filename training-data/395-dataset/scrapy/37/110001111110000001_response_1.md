The error message from the test function indicates that the ValueError is not being raised by the Request class when the url lacks a scheme (i.e., a colon). This suggests that the `_set_url` function is not correctly raising a ValueError in this scenario.

The potential error location within the `_set_url` function is the condition `if ':' not in self._url`. This condition is meant to check if the url contains a scheme (e.g., http, https) followed by a colon. If the scheme is missing, a ValueError should be raised.

The bug occurs because the condition `if ':' not in self._url` is incorrectly checking for the presence of a colon in the url instead of specifically checking for the presence of the scheme. As a result, the ValueError may not be raised when expected.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the condition to explicitly check for the presence of a scheme at the beginning of the url. This can be done by splitting the url and checking if the scheme is present.

Here's the corrected code for the `_set_url` function:

```python
def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)

    s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)
    self._url = escape_ajax(s)

    if not self._url.startswith(("http:", "https:")):
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % self._url)
```

With this correction, the condition checks if the url starts with either "http:" or "https:" as expected.
