The issue seems to be related to the `Request` function in the `scrapy` library, where it is not raising a `ValueError` when the URL provided to it is invalid. This is causing the test case `test_url_no_scheme` to fail.

Upon analyzing the code, it seems that the `_set_url` method is responsible for validating the URL and raising a `ValueError` if the URL does not contain a scheme.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `_set_url` method is not properly validating the URL and not raising a `ValueError` when the URL is invalid. This behavior is causing the `Request` function to accept invalid URLs without raising any errors.

To fix the bug, the `_set_url` method should properly validate the URL and raise a `ValueError` if the URL does not contain a scheme.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)

    s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)
    self._url = escape_ajax(s)

    if '://' not in self._url:
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % self._url)
```

By making this change, the `_set_url` method now correctly validates the URL and raises a `ValueError` if the URL does not contain a scheme. This should fix the bug and ensure that invalid URLs are not accepted by the `Request` function.
