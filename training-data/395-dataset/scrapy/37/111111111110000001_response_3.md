The potential error in the `_set_url` function is most likely occurring at the line:
```python
self._url = escape_ajax(s)
```
It seems that the function `escape_ajax` is not properly handling the input `s`, which may be causing the ValueError to not be raised as expected.

The reason behind the bug is that the `_set_url` function is not handling all possible cases for the input `url`, especially for cases where the URL does not contain a scheme (e.g., "http://").

To fix the bug, you can modify the `_set_url` function to properly handle cases where the URL does not contain a scheme. One approach is to check for the presence of a scheme in the input URL, and if it's not present, then prepend a default scheme (e.g., "http://") to the URL before processing it further.

Here's the corrected code for the `encoding` and `_set_url` functions:

```python
# Corrected function
def encoding(self):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# class declaration containing the corrected functions
class Request(object_ref):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # corrected _set_url function
    def _set_url(self, url):
        if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
            raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)
        
        if '://' not in url:
            url = 'http://' + url  # Add default scheme if not present
        
        s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)
        self._url = escape_ajax(s)
        
        if ':' not in self._url:
            raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % self._url)
```

With this corrected code, the `_set_url` function should now properly handle cases where the URL does not contain a scheme, and the ValueError should be raised as expected in the test case.
