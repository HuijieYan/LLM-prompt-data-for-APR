The error is occurring in the `_set_url` method of the `Request` class in the Scrapy library. The issue is that when an invalid URL is passed to the `Request` constructor, it doesn't raise an error as expected.

The potential error location within the `_set_url` method is the lack of proper validation for the input URL. The method only checks if the URL is a string or unicode, but it should also validate the URL format.

The bug occurs because the method doesn't have proper input validation and error handling for invalid URLs.

To fix the bug, the `_set_url` method should validate the URL format and raise an error if the URL is invalid. Additionally, the method should include proper error handling to ensure that any invalid URL inputs result in an informative error message.

Here's the corrected code for the `_set_url` method:

```python
def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)

    try:
        parsed_url = urlparse(url)
        if not parsed_url.scheme:
            raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % url)

        s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)
        self._url = escape_ajax(s)

    except Exception as e:
        raise ValueError('Invalid request url: %s' % url) from e
```
