Potential Error Location: The error is likely occurring in the _set_url function within the if statement checking if the url contains a colon ':'.

Reason for the Bug: The bug occurs because the function is checking for the presence of a URL scheme (e.g., http, https) by looking for a colon in the URL. If the colon is not present, it raises a ValueError indicating a missing scheme. However, this check is not sufficient as URLs without a scheme can also be valid in certain cases, such as when using a relative URL.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug: Modify the URL validation to handle both absolute and relative URLs. If the URL is relative, it should not raise a ValueError for a missing scheme.

Corrected Code:

```python
def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)

    s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)
    self._url = escape_ajax(s)

    # Check if the URL contains a scheme, if it does not, assume it is a relative URL
    if ':' not in self._url and not self._url.startswith('/'):
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % self._url)
```
