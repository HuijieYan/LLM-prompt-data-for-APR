Potential error location: The error may be occurring in the `_set_url` method of the Scrapy `Request` class, where the URL is not being properly validated for a missing scheme.

Reasons for the bug: The bug occurs because the `_set_url` method does not handle invalid URLs appropriately, leading to a silent failure when creating a `scrapy.Request` with an invalid URL.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Validate the URL to ensure it contains a scheme before setting it.
2. Raise a `ValueError` if the URL is invalid or missing a scheme.
3. Provide clear error messages and stack traces to indicate the issue with the URL.


# Corrected code for the `_set_url` method:
```python
import six
from scrapy.utils.python import Request

def _set_url(self, url):
    if not isinstance(url, six.string_types):
        raise TypeError('Request url must be str or unicode, got %s:' % type(url).__name__)

    if ':' not in url:
        raise ValueError('Missing scheme in request url: %s' % url)

    s = safe_url_string(url, self.encoding)
    self._url = escape_ajax(s)
```

In the corrected code, we ensure that the URL contains a scheme before setting it. If the URL is invalid or missing a scheme, a `ValueError` is raised with a clear error message. This fix will prevent the silent failure when creating a `scrapy.Request` with an invalid URL.
