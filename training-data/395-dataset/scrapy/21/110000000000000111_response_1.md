The error message indicates a KeyError occurring in the `_robots_error` function of the `robotstxt` middleware. This error is related to accessing a key (`netloc`) that does not exist in the `_parsers` dictionary.

The potential error location within the `_robots_error` function is the line `self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)`. The `pop` method is trying to remove the key `netloc` from the `_parsers` dictionary, but it is not handling the case where the key does not exist.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is assuming that the `netloc` key exists in the dictionary, and it is not handling the case where it does not.

To fix the bug, we can use the `pop` method with a default value provided, and then check if the popped value is not None before calling the `callback` method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    parser = self._parsers.pop(netloc, None)
    if parser is not None:
        parser.callback(None)
```

This fix ensures that the `netloc` key is removed from the dictionary with a default value of None if it does not exist, and then it checks if the popped value is not None before calling the `callback` method. This prevents the KeyError from occurring.
