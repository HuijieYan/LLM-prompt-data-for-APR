Potential error location: 
The error is likely occurring at the line `self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)`. It seems like the pop method is used incorrectly and is not handling the failure properly.

Reasons for the bug:
The `pop` method removes an item from the dictionary based on the key provided, and it returns the removed item. However, in this case, it seems like the intention is to call the `callback` method on the removed item, which is not the correct syntax for using the `pop` method.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
Instead of using the `pop` method, we can first retrieve the item from the dictionary using the `get` method, and then call the `callback` method on that item. This will ensure that the item is removed from the dictionary and its `callback` method is called as intended.

Corrected code:
```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    parser = self._parsers.pop(netloc, None)  # Retrieve and remove the item from the dictionary
    if parser:  # Check if the item exists
        parser.callback(None)  # Call the callback method on the removed item
```
