Potential error location: The error occurs at the line `self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)` in the `_robots_error` method of the `RobotsTxtMiddleware` class.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The error occurs because the `pop` method is used to remove an item from the dictionary (`self._parsers`) using the `netloc` as the key. If the key does not exist in the dictionary, a `KeyError` is raised.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Check if the key `netloc` exists in the dictionary before trying to remove it using `pop`.
2. Use a `try-except` block to handle the `KeyError` if it occurs.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class RobotsTxtMiddleware(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
        if netloc in self._parsers:
            self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)
        else:
            # handle the KeyError here, depending on what needs to be done
            pass
```
