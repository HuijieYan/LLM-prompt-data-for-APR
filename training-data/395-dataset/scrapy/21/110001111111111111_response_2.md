The error occurs in the `_robots_error` function, particularly at the line `self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)`. The error message indicates that a `KeyError` is being raised, which means that the key `'site.local'` is not found in the `_parsers` dictionary.

This is happening because the `_robots_error` function is trying to remove an item using `pop()` from the `_parsers` dictionary based on the `netloc` key, but it has already been removed in a different part of the program. 

To fix this, we can remove the entry from the `_parsers` dictionary without using the `pop()` method. 

Here's the corrected code for the `_robots_error` function:

```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    if netloc in self._parsers:
        del self._parsers[netloc]
```

With this correction, the function will remove the entry from the `_parsers` dictionary only if it exists, preventing the `KeyError` from being raised.
