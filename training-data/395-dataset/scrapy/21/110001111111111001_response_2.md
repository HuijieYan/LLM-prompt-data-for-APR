The error message indicates a KeyError occurring in the `robot_parser` method of the `RobotsTxtMiddleware` class. The error message is related to the `self._parsers` dictionary, specifically for the key 'site.local'.

The buggy function `_robots_error` is designed to handle the case when a Deferred in the `_parsers` dictionary needs to be removed. However, the current implementation is not handling this scenario correctly.

The bug occurs because when an immediate DNSLookupError happens and the `errback` function is called, the `_robots_error` method is not properly removing the Deferred from the `_parsers` dictionary. This leads to a KeyError in the subsequent execution of the `robot_parser` method.

To fix this bug, the `_robots_error` method should remove the Deferred related to the netloc key from the `_parsers` dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the `_robots_error` method:

```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    if netloc in self._parsers:
        del self._parsers[netloc]
```

With this correction, the function will properly remove the Deferred from the dictionary when the error occurs, addressing the KeyError and resolving the issue.
