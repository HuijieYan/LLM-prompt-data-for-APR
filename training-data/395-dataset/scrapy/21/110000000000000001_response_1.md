Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the line `self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)`.

Reasons behind the bug:
1. The `pop()` method removes the item at the specified position, but it does not return the item that was removed.
2. The `callback()` method is being called on the result of `pop(netloc)`, which would likely result in an AttributeError since `pop(netloc)` does not have a `callback` method.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the `pop()` method to remove the item from `_parsers` and then call the `callback` method on it separately.
2. Check if the item was successfully popped before calling the `callback` method on it.
3. Handle the failure scenario appropriately.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    parsed_data = self._parsers.pop(netloc, None)
    if parsed_data:
        parsed_data.callback(None)
    else:
        # Handle failure scenario
        pass
```
