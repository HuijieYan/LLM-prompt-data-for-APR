1. The test case `test_robotstxt_immediate_error` is trying to test the behavior of the RobotsTxtMiddleware when an immediate error occurs. It sets the `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY` setting to True, simulates a DNS lookup error, and then creates an instance of the RobotsTxtMiddleware. Finally, it sends a request to the middleware and checks if it is ignored.

2. The error message points to the problematic function `robot_parser`, specifically at the line `if isinstance(self._parsers[netloc], Deferred):`, where a KeyError is raised.

3. The reason behind the KeyError is that the `_parsers` dictionary does not contain a key for the `netloc` that is being accessed.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_parsers` dictionary contains the key `netloc` before trying to access it.

5. Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
class RobotsTxtMiddleware(object):
    def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
        if netloc in self._parsers:  # check if netloc is in _parsers
            self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)
```

By adding a check to see if the `netloc` is in the `_parsers` dictionary before trying to access it, we can prevent the KeyError from occurring.
