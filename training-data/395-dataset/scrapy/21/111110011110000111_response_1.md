The error message indicates a KeyError occurring in the `robot_parser` method of the `RobotsTxtMiddleware` class. The error happens when the `netloc` is not found in the `_parsers` dictionary.

The `robot_parser` method is responsible for parsing the robots.txt file for a given URL. It checks if the `netloc` exists in the `_parsers` dictionary, and if not, it adds a new Deferred object to the dictionary.

The issue seems to be with the `_robots_error` method, which is called when an error occurs while parsing the robots.txt file. It attempts to pop the `netloc` key from the `_parsers` dictionary, and if the key does not exist, it raises a KeyError.

To fix this issue, the `_robots_error` method should check if the `netloc` key exists in the `_parsers` dictionary before popping it. If the key exists, then it should pop the key; otherwise, it should handle the case where the key does not exist.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class RobotsTxtMiddleware(object):

    def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
        if netloc in self._parsers:
            self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)
        else:
            # Handle the case when netloc key is not found in _parsers
            # You can log the error or perform any necessary action
            pass
```

By adding a check to see if the `netloc` exists in the `_parsers` dictionary before popping it, we can avoid the KeyError that was occurring.
