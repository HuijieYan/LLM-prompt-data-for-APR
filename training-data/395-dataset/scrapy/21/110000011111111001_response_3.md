Based on the error message, the issue is likely occurring in the `_robots_error` method of the `RobotsTxtMiddleware` class. The error message indicates a KeyError with the key 'site.local' while checking if the value associated with the netloc key is an instance of Deferred.

The reason for the bug is that the `_robots_error` method is trying to remove the netloc key from the self._parsers dictionary without checking if the key exists, which leads to a KeyError.

To fix the bug, you can modify the `_robots_error` method to check if the netloc key exists in the dictionary before trying to remove it. If the key exists, it should be popped, otherwise, it can handle the case where the key is not present.

Here's the corrected code for the `_robots_error` method:

```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    if netloc in self._parsers:
        self._parsers.pop(netloc)
    else:
        # Handle the case where the key is not present
        pass
```

By making this change, the method will safely remove the netloc key from the dictionary if it exists, and it will handle the scenario where the key is not present.
