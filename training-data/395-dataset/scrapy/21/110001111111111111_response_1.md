The error occurs in the `_robots_error` method of the `RobotsTxtMiddleware` class. This method is called when there is an error in parsing the robots.txt file. The error causes a `KeyError` because the `netloc` key is being removed from the `_parsers` dictionary before it is looked up in the dictionary.

The correct approach is to remove the `netloc` key from the `_parsers` dictionary only after it has been looked up inside the `_robots_error` method.

Here's the corrected method:

```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    self._parsers[netloc].callback(None)
    self._parsers.pop(netloc)
```
