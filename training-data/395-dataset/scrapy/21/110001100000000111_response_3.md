Potential error location within the problematic function:
The error is occurring in the line `self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)` within the `_robots_error` method. It seems that the netloc key is not present in the `_parsers` dictionary, leading to a KeyError when trying to pop it.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The KeyError is likely occurring because the `netloc` key is not present in the `_parsers` dictionary. This could be due to an issue with the way the `netloc` key is being added to or looked up in the `_parsers` dictionary.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the `netloc` key exists in the `_parsers` dictionary before attempting to pop it, and handle the case where it doesn't exist.
2. Ensure that the `netloc` key is being added to the `_parsers` dictionary correctly before trying to access it in the `_robots_error` method.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    if netloc in self._parsers:
        self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)
    else:
        # Handle the case where netloc key does not exist in _parsers dictionary
        pass
```
By adding a check to verify if the `netloc` key exists in the `_parsers` dictionary before trying to pop it, we can prevent the KeyError from occurring.
