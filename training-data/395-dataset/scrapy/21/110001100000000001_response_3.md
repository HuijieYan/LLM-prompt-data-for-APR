The potential error in the provided code is that the function `_robots_error` is trying to access the `callback` method of the `self._parsers.pop(netloc)` without verifying if the `netloc` exists in the dictionary `self._parsers` or not. This can cause a KeyError if `netloc` does not exist in the dictionary.

To fix this issue, a check should be added to ensure that `netloc` exists in the `self._parsers` dictionary before attempting to access its callback method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    if netloc in self._parsers:
        self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)
    else:
        # Handle the case where netloc does not exist in self._parsers
        pass  # You can add code here to handle the specific case
``` 

By adding the check `if netloc in self._parsers`, we ensure that the `netloc` exists in the dictionary before trying to access its callback method, thus preventing a potential KeyError.
