The error in the `RobotsTxtMiddleware` class seems to be related to the `_robots_error` function, specifically the line `self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)`. 

Based on the provided input and expected values, it looks like the function is trying to pop the `netloc` key from the `self._parsers` dictionary and then call the `callback` method on the popped value. However, it seems that after popping the value, the callback method is being called on it, resulting in a KeyError.

To fix this issue, the function should pop the value from the dictionary and then check if the popped value is a Deferred object before calling its callback method. If it's not a Deferred object, then a KeyError might occur.

Here's the corrected code for the `_robots_error` function:

```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    rp_dfd = self._parsers.pop(netloc)
    if isinstance(rp_dfd, Deferred):
        rp_dfd.callback(None)
```

By first popping the value from the dictionary and then checking if it's a Deferred object before calling its callback method, we can avoid the KeyError and ensure that the function works as expected.
