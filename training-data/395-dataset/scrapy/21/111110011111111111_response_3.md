The error occurs in the `_robots_error` function of the `RobotsTxtMiddleware` class. When an error occurs during the download process, the `netloc` key is being popped from the `_parsers` dictionary, leading to a KeyError when the function tries to use it again.

The `_robots_error` function should not remove the `netloc` key from the `_parsers` dictionary, but instead set its value to `None`. This will prevent the KeyError from occurring when the key is accessed again.

Here's the corrected code for the `_robots_error` function:

```python
class RobotsTxtMiddleware(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the fixed function
    def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
        self._parsers[netloc] = None
```

By making this change, the KeyError should no longer occur when the `netloc` key is accessed after an error during the download process.
