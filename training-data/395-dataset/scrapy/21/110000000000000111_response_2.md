Potential error location: 
The line `self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)` is likely causing the KeyError. This is because `pop` method removes the item with the specified key from the dictionary, and then returns the value of that item. However, if the key does not exist in the dictionary, it will raise a KeyError.

Reason for the bug:
The error occurs because the `pop` method is being used to remove the item from the dictionary without checking if the key exists. If the key does not exist, it raises a KeyError.

Approach for fixing the bug:
Before calling `pop` method, it is important to check if the key exists in the dictionary to avoid the KeyError. This can be done using the `in` operator to check if the key exists before attempting to remove it.

Corrected code:

```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    if netloc in self._parsers:
        self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)
```
In the corrected code, we first check if the `netloc` exists in the `_parsers` dictionary before calling the `pop` method. This ensures that the KeyError is avoided.
