Potential error location: 

The error is likely occurring in the line `self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)`. It seems like the `pop` method is being used incorrectly, which is causing the error.

Reason behind the bug: 

The `pop` method removes the item with the specified key from the dictionary. However, it does not have a `callback` method, which is why the error occurs.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 

1. Use the `pop` method to remove the item from the dictionary and then call the `callback` method separately.
2. Check if the item exists in the dictionary before trying to remove it using `pop`, and then call the `callback` method if the item exists.

Corrected code:

```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    if netloc in self._parsers:
        self._parsers.pop(netloc)
        self.callback(None)
```
