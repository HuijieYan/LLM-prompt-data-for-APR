The potential error in the provided function is that it is trying to pop a key from the dictionary `self._parsers` without checking if the key exists. This will result in a KeyError if the key does not exist in the dictionary.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is assuming that the `netloc` key always exists in the dictionary `self._parsers`, which may not be the case.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the `netloc` key exists in the dictionary before trying to pop it. Additionally, we need to update the `callback` value of the popped Deferred object.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    if netloc in self._parsers:
        rp_dfd = self._parsers.pop(netloc)
        rp_dfd.callback(None)
    else:
        # handle the case when netloc key does not exist in the dictionary
        pass
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the `netloc` exists in the dictionary `self._parsers` using the `in` keyword. If it exists, we pop the value associated with the key `netloc` and then update its `callback` using `rp_dfd.callback(None)`. If the `netloc` key does not exist in the dictionary, we can add an `else` block to handle that specific case, although it's not clear from the provided information how to handle it.
