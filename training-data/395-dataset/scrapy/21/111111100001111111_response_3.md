The bug seems to be occurring because the `_robots_error` function is trying to access the `netloc` key from the `self._parsers` dictionary. However, in the buggy case, the `netloc` key does not exist in the `self._parsers` dictionary, which is causing a KeyError.

To fix this bug:
1. We need to check if the `netloc` key exists in the `self._parsers` dictionary before trying to access it.
2. If the `netloc` key exists, we should remove it from the dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the `_robots_error` function:

```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    if netloc in self._parsers:
        self._parsers.pop(netloc)
```

With this change, the function will first check if the `netloc` key exists in the `self._parsers` dictionary before trying to remove it. This should prevent the KeyError from occurring and fix the issue described in the bug report.
