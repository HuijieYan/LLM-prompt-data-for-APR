The potential error in the provided function is that it is trying to pop a value from the dictionary `self._parsers` using the key `netloc`, but it does not handle the case where the key does not exist in the dictionary. This could result in a `KeyError` if the key does not exist.

To fix this bug, we can use the `pop` method with a default value, so that if the key does not exist in the dictionary, it will return the default value instead of raising a `KeyError`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class RobotsTxtMiddleware(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
        self._parsers.pop(netloc, None).callback(None)
```

In the corrected function, we added `None` as the default value for the `pop` method. This ensures that if the `netloc` key does not exist in the dictionary, `pop` will return `None`, and the program will continue without raising a `KeyError`.
