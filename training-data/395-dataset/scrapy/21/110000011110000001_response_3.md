The test case is checking for the behavior of the RobotsTxtMiddleware when an immediate DNS lookup error occurs. The error message indicates a KeyError in the `robot_parser` method of the `RobotsTxtMiddleware` class.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `_robots_error` method. The error is occurring because the `pop()` method is being called on the `_parsers` dictionary without checking if the `netloc` key exists in the dictionary. This results in a KeyError when the key does not exist.

The bug occurs because the `_parsers` dictionary is being accessed without proper validation, which leads to a KeyError in the `robot_parser` method when the key does not exist.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the `netloc` key exists in the `_parsers` dictionary before trying to pop it. Additionally, we can handle the situation where the key does not exist by providing a default behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    if netloc in self._parsers:
        # Check if the key exists before popping it
        self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)
    else:
        # Handle the situation where the key does not exist
        # Add appropriate behavior here, like logging the missing key or raising an error
        pass
```

With this correction, we ensure that the `netloc` key exists in the `_parsers` dictionary before attempting to pop it, preventing the KeyError from occurring.
