The error is occurring at the line `self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)` inside the `_robots_error` function. The error message indicates a KeyError, which means that `netloc` is not found in `self._parsers` when `pop` is called.

The root cause of this bug is that the `_robots_error` function is attempting to pop the value associated with `netloc` from `self._parsers`, even though it may not exist.

To fix this bug, we can simply check if `netloc` exists in `self._parsers` before attempting to pop it. If it exists, we can then call `callback(None)` on the popped Deferred object.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class RobotsTxtMiddleware(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
        if netloc in self._parsers:
            parser = self._parsers.pop(netloc)
            parser.callback(None)
```

With this fix, the `_robots_error` function will first check if `netloc` exists as a key in `self._parsers`. If it does, it will pop the value associated with `netloc` and then call `callback(None)` on that value. This will prevent the KeyError from occurring when `netloc` does not exist in `self._parsers`.
