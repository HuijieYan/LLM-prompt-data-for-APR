The potential error in the provided function is that the `pop` method is being called on the `_parsers` dictionary without checking if the `netloc` key exists in the dictionary. This can result in a KeyError if the `netloc` key doesn't exist in the dictionary.

To fix this, we should use the `pop` method with a default value so that if the `netloc` key doesn't exist in the dictionary, it will return None instead of raising a KeyError.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    self._parsers.pop(netloc, None).callback(None)
```
