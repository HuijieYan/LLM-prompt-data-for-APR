The test case `test_robotstxt_immediate_error` sets up a scenario where an immediate error occurs during the download of a request. The error message indicates a `KeyError` being raised when trying to access the `self._parsers` dictionary using the `netloc` value `'site.local'`.

Based on the error message and the provided function, the potential error location is identified as the `_robots_error` function. In this function, the `netloc` value is being used to pop an item from the `self._parsers` dictionary without checking if it exists in the dictionary. This could lead to a `KeyError` if the `netloc` is not a valid key in the dictionary.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `_robots_error` function assumes that the `netloc` key will always exist in the `_parsers` dictionary, leading to a `KeyError` if this is not the case.

To fix the bug, a check should be added to ensure that the `netloc` key exists in the `_parsers` dictionary before attempting to remove it using the `pop` method. This can be achieved using the `in` keyword to check for the presence of the key.

Here's the corrected code for the `_robots_error` function:

```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    if netloc in self._parsers:
        self._parsers.pop(netloc)
```

With this correction, the function first checks if the `netloc` key exists in the `_parsers` dictionary before calling the `pop` method to remove it. This prevents the `KeyError` from occurring.
