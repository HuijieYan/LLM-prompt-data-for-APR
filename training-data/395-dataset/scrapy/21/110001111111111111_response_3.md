The provided test case `test_robotstxt_immediate_error` is testing the `RobotsTxtMiddleware` class. The error message indicates that the `KeyError` is occurring inside the `robot_parser` method of the `RobotsTxtMiddleware` class at line 65. This is consistent with the code provided for the `robot_parser` method, which suggests that the error is occurring when trying to access `self._parsers[netloc]`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that when an error occurs during the download of the robots.txt file, the `self._parsers[netloc]` value is never removed from the `_parsers` dictionary, resulting in a `KeyError` when checking if it's a `Deferred`. 

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to remove the `netloc` key from the `self._parsers` dictionary in the `self._robots_error` method. This will ensure that the key is removed when an error occurs, preventing the `KeyError` from happening later.

Here's the corrected code for the `self._robots_error` method:

```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    self._parsers.pop(netloc, None)
```

With this change, the `netloc` key will be removed from the `self._parsers` dictionary when an error occurs, preventing the `KeyError` from happening.
