The error message indicates a KeyError: 'site.local'. This suggests that the key 'site.local' is not present in the _parsers dictionary, causing the error when trying to pop it in the _robots_error method.

The potential error location within the _robots_error method is the line:
```python
self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the netloc key is not present in the _parsers dictionary when trying to pop it.

To fix the bug, we can add a check to see if the netloc exists in the _parsers dictionary before trying to pop it. If it doesn't exist, we can handle it accordingly to avoid the KeyError.

Here's the corrected code for the _robots_error method:

```python
class RobotsTxtMiddleware(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
        if netloc in self._parsers:
            self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)
        else:
            # handle the case where netloc is not in _parsers
            pass
```
