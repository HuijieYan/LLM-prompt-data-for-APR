1. The test case is trying to simulate an immediate error in the RobotsTxtMiddleware. It sets the ROBOTSTXT_OBEY setting to True and causes a DNSLookupError by using the immediate_failure function. The test checks if the middleware is able to handle the error correctly.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the _robots_error method. Specifically, the line `self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)` seems to be the cause of the KeyError.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the _robots_error method is attempting to pop an item from the self._parsers dictionary based on the netloc key. If the netloc key does not exist in the dictionary, it will raise a KeyError.

4. To fix the bug, a key check should be added to ensure that the netloc exists in the self._parsers dictionary before attempting to pop it. Additionally, if the key does not exist, the method should handle the error gracefully without raising an exception.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    if netloc in self._parsers:
        self._parsers[netloc].callback(None)
    else:
        # Handle the case where netloc does not exist in the dictionary
        # For example, you can log the error or take other necessary actions
        pass
```
