Potential error location:
The error seems to be located in the line `self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)` of the `_robots_error` function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `pop()` method removes the item with the specified key from the dictionary and returns its value. In this case, the value is a Deferred object. However, the `callback(None)` method is called on the returned value, which is not valid.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
We should first store the removed Deferred object in a variable and then call the `callback(None)` method on that object, if it exists.

Corrected code:
```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    rp_dfd = self._parsers.pop(netloc, None)
    if rp_dfd is not None:
        rp_dfd.callback(None)
```
