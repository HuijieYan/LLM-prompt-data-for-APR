Potential error location: 
The error is likely occurring in the line `self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)` of the `_robots_error` function.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The error message indicates a KeyError, which means that the specified key ('yellowpages.co.th') is not found in the `_parsers` dictionary. This could happen if the `netloc` parameter does not exist as a key in the `_parsers` dictionary.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the `netloc` key exists in the `_parsers` dictionary before attempting to pop it.
2. Handle the situation where the key does not exist more gracefully, such as by logging a warning or handling it as an exceptional case.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    if netloc in self._parsers:
        self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)
    else:
        # Handle the case where netloc is not in the _parsers dictionary
        # For example, log a warning or handle it as an exceptional case
        pass
```
