The error is likely occurring because the `_parsers` dictionary is being accessed with the `netloc` key, but that key is not always present in the dictionary.

To fix the bug, we should check if the `netloc` key exists in the `_parsers` dictionary before trying to access it. If it does not exist, we can simply return from the function without doing anything.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    if netloc in self._parsers:
        self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)
```
