The error message indicates a KeyError on line 65 of the robot_parser method in the RobotsTxtMiddleware class. This means that the _parsers dictionary does not contain the key 'site.local'.

The test function test_robotstxt_immediate_error sets up a DNSLookupError and a Deferred object to simulate an immediate failure. It then creates an instance of RobotsTxtMiddleware and checks if a Request is ignored.

The bug is occurring in the _robots_error method, specifically in the line self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None). The error message indicates that the _parsers dictionary does not contain the key corresponding to the netloc. This is causing the KeyError.

To fix this issue, the _robots_error method should first check if the netloc exists in the _parsers dictionary before attempting to pop it. If the netloc exists in the dictionary, then it should be popped and the callback should be called. If the netloc does not exist in the dictionary, an appropriate error handling mechanism should be implemented.

Here's the corrected code for the _robots_error method:

```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    if netloc in self._parsers:
        self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)
    else:
        # Handle the case where netloc does not exist in the _parsers dictionary
        # For example, log the error or raise an exception
        pass
```
