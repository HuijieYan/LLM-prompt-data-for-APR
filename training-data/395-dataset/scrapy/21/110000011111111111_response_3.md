The bug occurs in the `_robots_error` function. The function is attempting to pop a value from the dictionary `self._parsers` using the `netloc` as the key. However, if the key `'site.local'` does not exist in the dictionary, a `KeyError` will be raised.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the key exists in the dictionary before attempting to pop it. If the key exists, we can pop the value; otherwise, we can ignore the action.

Here's the corrected code for the `_robots_error` function:

```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    if netloc in self._parsers:
        self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)
```

By adding the conditional check `if netloc in self._parsers`, we can avoid the `KeyError` from occurring. This change ensures that the key is present in the dictionary before attempting to pop it.
