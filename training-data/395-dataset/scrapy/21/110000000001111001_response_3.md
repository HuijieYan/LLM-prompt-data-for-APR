The buggy function `_robots_error` is supposed to remove the entry for the given `netloc` from the `_parsers` dictionary and then call the `callback` function on the removed value, but it has a bug.

The issue lies in the line `self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)`. It is trying to call `callback` on the removed value without storing the removed value in a variable.

The reason for the bug is that the `pop` method of a dictionary removes and returns the value associated with the specified key. In this case, the intention is to return the value and then call `callback` on it, but the code is only calling `callback` on the removed value.

To fix the bug, the removed value should be stored in a variable, and then `callback` should be called on that variable.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    rp_dfd = self._parsers.pop(netloc) # remove and store the value
    if rp_dfd:
        rp_dfd.callback(None) # call callback on the stored value if it exists
```
