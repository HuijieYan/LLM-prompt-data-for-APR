Potential Error Location:
The error is likely occurring on the line `self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)` within the `_robots_error` function.

Reasons for the Bug:
The `pop` method removes the item with the specified key from the dictionary. However, in this case, the intention seems to be to remove and trigger a callback on the value associated with the specified key.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the line `self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)` to `self._parsers[netloc].callback(None)` to trigger the callback on the value associated with the `netloc` key. Additionally, we should handle the case when the `netloc` key does not exist in the `_parsers` dictionary.

Corrected Code:
```python
class RobotsTxtMiddleware(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
        if netloc in self._parsers:
            self._parsers[netloc].callback(None)
```
