The error is occurring in the `robot_parser` function of the `RobotsTxtMiddleware` class. The error is a KeyError on `netloc` which means that `self._parsers` does not have the key `netloc`.

The `_robots_error` function is being called as an errback from a Deferred object. It is removing the `netloc` key from `self._parsers`, but the `robot_parser` function assumes that the key always exists.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `_robots_error` function to check if the key exists in `self._parsers` before trying to remove it.

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class RobotsTxtMiddleware(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # Fixed _robots_error function
    def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
        if netloc in self._parsers:
            self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)
```

By adding this check, we ensure that the key `netloc` exists in `self._parsers` before trying to remove it. This should prevent the KeyError from occurring and resolve the issue.
