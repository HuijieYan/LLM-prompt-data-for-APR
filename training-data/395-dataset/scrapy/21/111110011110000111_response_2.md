The error message indicates a KeyError occurring in the `robot_parser` method of the `RobotsTxtMiddleware` class. The error occurs when the netloc is not found in the `_parsers` dictionary.

The reason behind the bug is that the `_robots_error` method is trying to pop an item from the `_parsers` dictionary using the `netloc` as the key without checking if the key exists. This causes a KeyError when the key is not found in the dictionary.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_robots_error` method to handle the case when the `netloc` key is not found in the `_parsers` dictionary. We can use the `pop()` method with a default value, so that if the key is not found, it doesn't raise a KeyError.

Here's the corrected code for the `_robots_error` method:

```python
class RobotsTxtMiddleware(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
        # safe pop using default value in case key is not found
        self._parsers.pop(netloc, None).callback(None)
```

By modifying the `_robots_error` method as shown above, we can prevent the KeyError from occurring when trying to pop an item from the `_parsers` dictionary using the `netloc` as the key.
