The error in the provided buggy function is that it is trying to remove an item from the dictionary (self._parsers) using the `pop` method, which returns the value of the removed item, and then calling the `callback` method on that value. This leads to accessing and calling the `callback` method on `None`, which causes the error.

To fix this, we should update the function to first remove the item from the dictionary and then call the `callback` method on the removed value.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    if netloc in self._parsers:
        rp_dfd = self._parsers.pop(netloc)
        if rp_dfd:
            rp_dfd.callback(None)
```
