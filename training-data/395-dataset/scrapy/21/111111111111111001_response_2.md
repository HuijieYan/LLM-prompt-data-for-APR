The error occurs because when the `_robots_error` function is called, it tries to remove the `netloc` key from `self._parsers`, but it's already been removed due to the `Deferred` being called in the `robot_parser` function.

To fix this, we should first check if the key exists in the dictionary before trying to remove it. Additionally, we can ensure that the callback is not called with a `None` value, as it could lead to unpredictable behavior in the program.

Here's the corrected code for the `_robots_error` function:

```python
# corrected function for the RobotsTxtMiddleware class
class RobotsTxtMiddleware(object):
    # ... omitted code ...


    # this is the fixed function
    def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
        if netloc in self._parsers:
            self._parsers.pop(netloc)
            if hasattr(self._parsers[netloc], 'callback'):
                self._parsers[netloc].callback(None)
```

By adding a check to see if the key `netloc` exists in `self._parsers` before trying to remove it, and also verifying that the callback method exists, we address the issue described in the error message and ensure that the function behaves as intended.
