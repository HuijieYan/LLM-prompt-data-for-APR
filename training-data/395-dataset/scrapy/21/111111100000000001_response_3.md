The potential error in the problematic function is the use of `self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)`. This line is attempting to access the `callback` method on the result of the `pop` operation, which is not possible.

The error occurs because `pop` method returns the value associated with the specified key, and in this case, the value is being accessed directly and `callback` method is called on it. 

To fix the bug, we can first retrieve the value associated with `netloc` using `pop` method, and then call the `callback` method on it.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    parser = self._parsers.pop(netloc, None)
    if parser:
        parser.callback(None)
```
