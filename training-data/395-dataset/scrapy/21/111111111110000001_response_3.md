The error message indicates a KeyError in the `robot_parser` method of the `RobotsTxtMiddleware` class when trying to access `self._parsers[netloc]`. This error seems to be related to the `_robots_error` method since it is called when an error occurs during parsing the robots.txt file.

The cause of the bug is that the `_robots_error` method is trying to access the `self._parsers` dictionary without checking if the `netloc` key exists in the dictionary. This results in a KeyError if the key does not exist.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_robots_error` method to first check if the `netloc` key exists in the `_parsers` dictionary before trying to pop it.

Here's the corrected code for the `_robots_error` method:

```python
class RobotsTxtMiddleware(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
        if netloc in self._parsers:
            self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)
```

By adding the check `if netloc in self._parsers`, we ensure that the key exists in the dictionary before popping it. This modification should prevent the KeyError from occurring and resolve the issue.
