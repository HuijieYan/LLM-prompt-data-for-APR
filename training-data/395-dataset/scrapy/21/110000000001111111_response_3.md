The bug in the `_robots_error` function is causing a KeyError due to an attempt to pop a key from the `_parsers` dictionary that doesn't exist. This is evident from the error message "KeyError: 'yellowpages.co.th'" and the input and expected variable values.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to check if the `netloc` key exists in the `_parsers` dictionary before attempting to pop it. If the key exists, we can pop it and set the corresponding value to None. If the key doesn't exist, we can simply ignore it.

Here's the corrected code for the `_robots_error` function:

```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    if netloc in self._parsers:
        rp_dfd = self._parsers.pop(netloc)
        rp_dfd.callback(None)
    else:
        # handle the case when netloc key doesn't exist in self._parsers
        pass
```
