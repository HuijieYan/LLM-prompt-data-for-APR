The error is likely occurring at the line `self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)`. The error message "KeyError: 'yellowpages.co.th'" indicates that `netloc` is not present in the `_parsers` dictionary.

The bug occurs because the `pop()` method of dictionaries removes the specified key and returns its value, and then the `callback(None)` method is called on the returned value. If the key does not exist in the dictionary, a `KeyError` will be raised.

To fix this bug, we should first check if the key `netloc` exists in the dictionary before attempting to pop it. If it does, we can then call the `callback(None)` method on the popped value.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    if netloc in self._parsers:
        rp_dfd = self._parsers.pop(netloc)
        rp_dfd.callback(None)
```

With this implementation, we first check if `netloc` exists in the `_parsers` dictionary. If it does, we then pop it and call the `callback(None)` method on the popped value. If it doesn't exist, nothing will happen.

This should fix the `KeyError` issue caused by the original buggy function.
