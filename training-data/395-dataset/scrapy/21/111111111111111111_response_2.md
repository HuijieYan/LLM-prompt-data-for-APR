The issue is likely occurring because the `_robots_error` function is popping the `netloc` key from the `_parsers` dictionary before calling the `callback` method on the Deferred. This results in a KeyError when trying to access the `netloc` key of `_parsers`.

To fix the issue, we should first call the `callback` method on the Deferred and then pop the `netloc` key from the `_parsers` dictionary.

Corrected code for the `_robots_error` function:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class RobotsTxtMiddleware(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
        # Call the callback method on the Deferred
        self._parsers[netloc].callback(None)
        # Pop the netloc key from the _parsers dictionary
        self._parsers.pop(netloc)
```

By making this change, we ensure that the Deferred's callback method is called first before removing the `netloc` key from the `_parsers` dictionary, preventing the KeyError from occurring.
