The error message indicates a KeyError in the robot_parser method of the RobotsTxtMiddleware class in the robotstxt.py file. The KeyError is occurring in the _robots_error method.

It seems that the _robots_error method is trying to pop the netloc key from the _parsers dictionary. However, if the netloc key does not exist in the _parsers dictionary, a KeyError will be raised.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the _robots_error method to safely remove the netloc key from the _parsers dictionary only if it exists.

Here's the corrected code for the _robots_error method:

```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    if netloc in self._parsers:
        self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)
```

By adding a check to see if the netloc key exists in the _parsers dictionary, we can prevent the KeyError from occurring.

Additionally, it's worth noting that there could be other potential bug locations, but based on the provided code and error message, this fix should address the KeyError issue in the _robots_error method.
