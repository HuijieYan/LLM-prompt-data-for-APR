The buggy function `_robots_error` is intended to remove an item from the `self._parsers` dictionary and then call the `callback` method on the removed item. However, the `pop` method returns the removed item, and the callback is being called on this removed item, which is causing the issue.

To fix this bug, we need to first store the popped item in a variable, call the `callback` method on that item, and then remove it from the dictionary.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    rp_dfd = self._parsers.pop(netloc)
    rp_dfd.callback(None)
```
