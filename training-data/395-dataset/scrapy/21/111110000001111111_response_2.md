The bug in the provided function `_robots_error` is likely causing a KeyError in the dictionary `self._parsers`. The function is supposed to remove the `netloc` key from the `_parsers` dictionary, but it seems to be throwing a KeyError.

The reason for this bug could be that the `netloc` key is not present in the dictionary `self._parsers`. This could potentially happen due to the inconsistency between the values stored in `self._parsers` and the actual netloc value.

To fix this bug, you can modify the function to handle the KeyError gracefully and avoid the program from crashing. You can also update the code to remove the netloc key only if it exists in the dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class RobotsTxtMiddleware(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
        if netloc in self._parsers:
            self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)
        else:
            # Handle the case where netloc is not in self._parsers
            # Do nothing or log the error as per your requirement
            pass
```

With this modification, the function will check if the `netloc` exists in `self._parsers` before attempting to remove it to avoid the KeyError. This should resolve the issue of KeyError in the robotstxt middleware.
