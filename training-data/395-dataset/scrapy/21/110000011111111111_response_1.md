The error occurs at the `_robots_error` method of the `RobotsTxtMiddleware` class. The method is attempting to remove the `netloc` key from the `_parsers` dictionary, but it is encountering a `KeyError` because the key `netloc` is not present in the dictionary.

The bug occurs because the `_parsers` dictionary is not being properly updated when the `netloc` key is added. The `_parsers` dictionary should be updated when a new `netloc` key is encountered.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_robots_error` method to handle the case where the `netloc` key does not exist in the `_parsers` dictionary. We can simply skip the callback if the key does not exist.

Here's the corrected code for the `_robots_error` method:

```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    if netloc in self._parsers:
        self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)
```

By adding the check `if netloc in self._parsers`, we ensure that the `pop` operation only occurs if the `netloc` key exists in the dictionary. This prevents the `KeyError` from occurring.

With this modification, the issue with the `KeyError` should be resolved.
