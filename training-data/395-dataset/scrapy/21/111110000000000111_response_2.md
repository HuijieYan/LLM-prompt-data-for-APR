Potential error location:
The error is occurring at the line `self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)`. It seems that the `_parsers` dictionary does not contain the `netloc` key, leading to a `KeyError`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `_robots_error` function is attempting to pop an item from the `_parsers` dictionary using the `netloc` key without checking if the key exists in the dictionary. This is causing a KeyError when the `netloc` key does not exist in the dictionary.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the `netloc` key exists in the dictionary before attempting to pop it.
2. Handle the KeyError exception in a way that prevents the function from crashing.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
    if netloc in self._parsers:
        self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)
    # Handle KeyError exception if needed
```
