1. The test case is checking for the proper handling of a DNSLookupError exception when the robots.txt address is not found.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the `_robots_error` method.

3. The error occurs because the `_robots_error` method tries to pop an item from the `_parsers` dictionary using the `netloc` as the key. However, since the key might not exist in the dictionary, it results in a KeyError when trying to pop it.

4. One possible approach to fixing the bug is to check if the `netloc` exists in the `_parsers` dictionary before attempting to pop it. If it exists, then proceed with popping the item; otherwise, handle it as appropriate.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class RobotsTxtMiddleware(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
        if netloc in self._parsers:
            self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)
```
