Potential error location: The error is likely occurring at the line `self._parsers.pop(netloc).callback(None)`.

Reasons for the bug: This function is trying to pop the `netloc` key from the `_parsers` dictionary and then call the `callback` method on the popped value. The issue here is that the `pop` method returns the value associated with the specified key and removes that key-value pair from the dictionary. Then, it is trying to call the `callback` method on the popped value, which may not be possible if the value does not have a `callback` method.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the `netloc` key exists in the `_parsers` dictionary before popping it, to avoid a KeyError.
2. Check if the popped value has a `callback` method before calling it, to avoid an AttributeError.

Corrected code:
```python
class RobotsTxtMiddleware(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _robots_error(self, failure, netloc):
        if netloc in self._parsers:
            parser = self._parsers.pop(netloc)
            if hasattr(parser, 'callback') and callable(getattr(parser, 'callback')):
                parser.callback(None)
```
