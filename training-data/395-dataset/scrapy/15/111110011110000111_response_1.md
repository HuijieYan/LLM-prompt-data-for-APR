The error message indicates that the `UnicodeError: label empty or too long` occurs when the function `_safe_ParseResult` is trying to encode the `netloc` part using the `idna` codec.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `to_native_str(parts.netloc.encode('idna'))`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `netloc` part may contain an empty label or a label that is too long, causing the `idna` encoding to fail.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to handle the `UnicodeError` exception when encoding the `netloc` part with the `idna` codec.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import quote, urlparse

def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    netloc = parts.netloc
    try:
        netloc = to_native_str(parts.netloc.encode('idna'))
    except UnicodeError:
        pass
    
    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        netloc,

        # default encoding for path component SHOULD be UTF-8
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),

        # encoding of query and fragment follows page encoding
        # or form-charset (if known and passed)
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
    )
```

In the corrected code, we added a `try-except` block to handle the `UnicodeError` that might occur during the `idna` encoding of the `netloc` part. If a `UnicodeError` occurs, we simply use the original `netloc` without encoding it.
