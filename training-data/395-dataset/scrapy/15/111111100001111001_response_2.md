The error in the code is likely due to the use of the `to_native_str` and `to_bytes` functions, which are not defined in the provided code. Additionally, the use of `quote` is not correctly handling the special characters in the input.

To fix this, we can modify the code to use the `quote_plus` function from the `urllib.parse` module, which properly handles the encoding and quoting of special characters in URLs.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from urllib.parse import quote_plus

def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    return (
        parts.scheme,
        parts.netloc.encode('idna').decode('utf-8'),
        quote_plus(parts.path, encoding=path_encoding),
        quote_plus(parts.params, encoding=path_encoding),
        quote_plus(parts.query, encoding=encoding),
        quote_plus(parts.fragment, encoding=encoding)
    )
```

With this correction, the function should now handle URIs with special characters in a safe manner.
