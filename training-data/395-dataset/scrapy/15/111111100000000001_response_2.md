Potential error location: The potential error in the code is the use of `to_bytes` and `to_native_str` functions without defining them.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the `to_bytes` and `to_native_str` functions are not defined. These functions are likely meant to handle the conversion of strings to bytes and native strings, but they are not implemented in the provided code.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: Define the `to_bytes` and `to_native_str` functions to handle the conversion of strings to bytes and native strings, respectively. Additionally, it is important to import the necessary modules for the functions used in the code.

Corrected code:
```python
import urllib.parse

def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    return (
        parts.scheme.decode('utf-8'),
        parts.netloc.encode('idna').decode('utf-8'),

        # default encoding for path component SHOULD be UTF-8
        urllib.parse.quote(parts.path.encode(path_encoding), safe=_safe_chars),
        urllib.parse.quote(parts.params.encode(path_encoding), safe=_safe_chars),

        # encoding of query and fragment follows page encoding
        # or form-charset (if known and passed)
        urllib.parse.quote(parts.query.encode(encoding), safe=_safe_chars),
        urllib.parse.quote(parts.fragment.encode(encoding), safe=_safe_chars)
    )
```
