The issue with the provided function is that it is trying to encode the `netloc` value, which is unnecessary.

The `netloc` attribute of the `parts` object is already a string, so there is no need to encode it again. The `to_native_str()` function is sufficient for converting the netloc to a native string.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        to_native_str(parts.netloc),

        # default encoding for path component SHOULD be UTF-8
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),

        # encoding of query and fragment follows page encoding
        # or form-charset (if known and passed)
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
    )
```
