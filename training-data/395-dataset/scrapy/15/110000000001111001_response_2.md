The potential error in the provided function is that the netloc value is being encoded using the 'idna' encoding without converting it to bytes. This could lead to encoding errors and potentially cause the function to fail.

The netloc value should be converted to bytes first using the specified encoding before applying the idna encoding. Also, the to_native_str and to_bytes functions are not provided in the code, so assuming they are predefined functions for type conversion, they should be used appropriately.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to convert the netloc value to bytes using the specified encoding before applying the idna encoding. We also need to handle the encoding for the other parts of the URL as required by the function.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
from urllib.parse import quote, to_bytes

def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        to_native_str(parts.netloc),

        # default encoding for path component SHOULD be UTF-8
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),

        # encoding of query and fragment follows page encoding
        # or form-charset (if known and passed)
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
    )
```

In this corrected code, we have removed the unnecessary idna encoding for the netloc value and used the to_bytes function to handle the encoding for the different parts of the URL.
