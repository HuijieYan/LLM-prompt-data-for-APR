After analyzing the provided code, test case, and error message, it is evident that the issue arises in the `canonicalize_url` function, specifically within the `_safe_ParseResult` function. The error is raised when trying to encode the `netloc` component to IDNA.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `netloc` is being encoded to IDNA, which might result in a UnicodeError due to an empty label or a label that is too long. This occurs when the netloc is not a valid domain or host name.

To fix this bug, we can catch the `UnicodeError` exception when encoding the `netloc` to IDNA and handle it gracefully.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, ParseResult, quote
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes, to_native_str

def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    try:
        netloc = to_native_str(parts.netloc.encode('idna'))
    except UnicodeError:
        netloc = ''

    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        netloc,
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
    )
```

In this corrected code, we catch the `UnicodeError` when encoding the `netloc` to IDNA. If a `UnicodeError` occurs, we assign an empty string to `netloc` to prevent the error from propagating further.

This approach ensures that the potential `UnicodeError` related to IDNA encoding of the `netloc` is handled gracefully, allowing the extraction of all valid links from the response.
