The error occurs when the function `_safe_ParseResult` attempts to encode the `netloc` part of the URL using the 'idna' codec, which is throwing a UnicodeError due to the label being either empty or too long.

The bug occurs because the encoding 'idna' is not suitable for all domain names and can throw errors if the domain name does not follow the IDNA rules.

To fix this bug, we can replace the encoding of the `netloc` part with a safer approach that can handle domain names more gracefully.

Here's the corrected code for the `_safe_ParseResult` function:

```python
def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        parts.netloc,  # No need to encode netloc, leave it as it is

        # default encoding for path component SHOULD be UTF-8
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),

        # encoding of query and fragment follows page encoding
        # or form-charset (if known and passed)
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
    )
```

By removing the attempt to encode the `netloc` using the 'idna' codec and leaving it as it is, we avoid the UnicodeError that was occurring.
