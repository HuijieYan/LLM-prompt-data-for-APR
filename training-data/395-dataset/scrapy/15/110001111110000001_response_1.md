The error message indicates that there is a UnicodeError with the 'idna' codec due to "label empty or too long." This error occurs in the `_safe_ParseResult` function when trying to encode the `netloc` attribute of the `parts` object.

The error occurs because the `parts.netloc` is incorrect, leading to the UnicodeError. This can be due to the parsing of the URL not handling IDNA encodings properly.

To fix this issue, the `parts.netloc` should be properly encoded using the 'idna' codec and then decoded to the native string using the specified encoding.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from urllib.parse import quote, ParseResult

# this is the buggy function you need to fix
def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        parts.netloc.encode('idna').decode('utf-8'),

        # default encoding for path component SHOULD be UTF-8
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),

        # encoding of query and fragment follows page encoding
        # or form-charset (if known and passed)
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
    )
```

With these changes, the `parts.netloc` will be properly encoded using the 'idna' codec and then decoded to the native string using UTF-8. This should resolve the UnicodeError that was occurring.
