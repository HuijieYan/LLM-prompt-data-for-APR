The issue with the `_safe_ParseResult` function is that the `parts.netloc` value is being passed to `to_native_str` and then to `to_native_str(parts.netloc.encode('idna'))`, which is redundant and unnecessary. It should only be passed to `to_native_str(parts.netloc.encode('idna'))` since it needs to be encoded using IDNA.

Additionally, the `to_native_str` function is not defined in the provided code, so we will assume it is a custom function for converting to native string format.

Here's the corrected code for the `_safe_ParseResult` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import quote, urlunparse, ParseResult

def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        to_native_str(parts.netloc.encode('idna')).decode('utf-8'),  # encoding netloc using IDNA and then decoding it to utf-8
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
    )
```

In this corrected code, we have removed the redundant `to_native_str(parts.netloc)` and adjusted the encoding for `parts.netloc` using IDNA as required.

Now, this function should work correctly for the provided test cases and produce the expected results.
