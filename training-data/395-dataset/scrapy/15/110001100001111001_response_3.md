The issue with the current function is that it does not handle domain names with more than 63 characters, as specified by the IDNA encoding standard. This leads to the error when trying to encode the netloc value with the IDNA encoding method.

To fix this issue, the netloc value should be checked for its length before encoding, and if it exceeds 63 characters, it should be split into parts and then encoded using the IDNA encoding method.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    scheme = to_native_str(parts.scheme)
    
    # handle netloc encoding for IDNA
    netloc = parts.netloc
    if len(netloc) > 63:
        # Splitting the domain into labels
        labels = netloc.split('.')
        netloc = '.'.join([x.encode('idna').decode('utf-8') for x in labels])

    path = quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars)
    params = quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars)
    query = quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars)
    fragment = quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)

    return (scheme, to_native_str(netloc), path, params, query, fragment)
```

This updated code correctly handles the encoding of the netloc value for domain names with more than 63 characters.
