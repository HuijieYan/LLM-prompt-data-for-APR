The error occurs when attempting to encode `parts.netloc` with the 'idna' codec. The error message indicates that the label is either empty or too long, and this is causing a UnicodeError.

This is likely happening due to an issue with the parsing of the URL, which is causing the netloc to be empty or invalid.

To fix this bug:
- Ensure that the URL parsing is done correctly, and the netloc is extracted accurately.
- Check whether the URL being passed to the `canonicalize_url` function is valid and contains a valid netloc.

Here's the corrected code for the `_safe_ParseResult` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, quote

def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    netloc = parts.netloc or ''  # handle empty netloc
    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        to_native_str(netloc.encode('idna')),  # encode the netloc after handling empty case

        # default encoding for path component SHOULD be UTF-8
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),

        # encoding of query and fragment follows page encoding
        # or form-charset (if known and passed)
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
    )
```

By handling the case when netloc is empty, we prevent the issue of an empty or invalid label when encoding with 'idna'.
