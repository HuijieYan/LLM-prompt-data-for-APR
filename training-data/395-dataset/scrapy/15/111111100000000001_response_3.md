Potential error location: The error may be occurring in the `to_bytes` and `to_native_str` functions as well as in the argument `path_encoding='utf8'`.

Reasons for the occurrence of the bug: The error may be caused by incorrect encoding and decoding of the parts of the URL. The functions `to_bytes` and `to_native_str` may not be handling the encoding properly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: It is important to ensure that the encoding and decoding of the URL parts are handled properly. Using the correct encoding and decoding methods will help in resolving the issue.

Corrected code:

```python
from urllib.parse import quote, urlsplit
import idna

def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    return (
        parts.scheme,
        parts.netloc.encode('idna').decode('utf-8'),

        # default encoding for path component SHOULD be UTF-8
        quote(parts.path, safe=_safe_chars),
        quote(parts.params, safe=_safe_chars),

        # encoding of query and fragment follows page encoding
        # or form-charset (if known and passed)
        quote(parts.query, safe=_safe_chars),
        quote(parts.fragment, safe=_safe_chars)
    )
```
