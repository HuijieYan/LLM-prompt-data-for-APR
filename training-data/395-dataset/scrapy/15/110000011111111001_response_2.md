This bug seems to be related to the encoding of the `netloc` part using the `'idna'` codec. The error message specifically mentions "UnicodeError: label empty or too long," which indicates an issue with the length of the DNS label.

The problem occurs because the `netloc` part is being directly encoded using the `'idna'` codec without splitting it into labels and checking their lengths. This leads to errors when the length of the label is too long.

To fix this bug, we need to split the `netloc` into labels and encode each label separately using the `'idna'` codec.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    netloc_labels = parts.netloc.split('.')
    encoded_labels = [label.encode('idna') for label in netloc_labels]
    netloc_encoded = b'.'.join(encoded_labels)
    
    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        to_native_str(netloc_encoded),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
    )
```

In this corrected function, we split the `netloc` into labels, encode each label using the `'idna'` codec, and then join the encoded labels back together. This approach ensures that each label is correctly encoded using the `'idna'` codec and prevents errors related to label lengths.
