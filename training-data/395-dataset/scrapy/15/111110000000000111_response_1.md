The error seems to be related to the encoding of the netloc part of a URL. It appears that the `idna` encoding is causing an issue when it encounters an empty or excessively long label.

The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be the line:
```python
to_native_str(parts.netloc.encode('idna')),
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `idna` encoding is not handling empty or excessively long labels properly.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `_safe_ParseResult` function to handle the encoding of netloc more robustly. We can also add exception handling to handle the UnicodeError that occurs when the label is empty or too long.

Here's the corrected code for the `_safe_ParseResult` function:

```python
def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    try:
        # handle the encoding of netloc
        netloc_encoded = parts.netloc.encode('idna') if parts.netloc else ''
        
        return (
            to_native_str(parts.scheme),
            to_native_str(netloc_encoded),

            # default encoding for path component SHOULD be UTF-8
            quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
            quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),

            # encoding of query and fragment follows page encoding
            # or form-charset (if known and passed)
            quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
            quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
        )
    except UnicodeError:
        # handle the UnicodeError
        return None
```

In the corrected function, we added a `try-except` block to handle the UnicodeError that might occur during the encoding process. We also included a check for an empty `netloc` to prevent the encoding of an empty label, which was causing the error.
