The error is occurring because the netloc value is being encoded with 'idna', which is causing a UnicodeError when the netloc value is either empty or too long.

To fix this bug, we can remove the encoding of the netloc value and instead directly convert it to a native string.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from urllib.parse import quote, urlparse

def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        to_native_str(parts.netloc),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
    )
```

By removing the encoding from the netloc value, we can prevent the UnicodeError from occurring.
