The error message suggests that the problem is occurring in the `_safe_ParseResult` function, specifically in the line `to_native_str(parts.netloc.encode('idna'))`. This error is being raised because the `netloc` value is causing an issue when encoded with the 'idna' codec.

The reason for this bug is that the `netloc` value might have an unsupported character or an invalid value, causing the encoding with the 'idna' codec to fail.

To fix this bug, one possible approach could be to handle the encoding with the 'idna' codec in a more robust way. This could involve checking for invalid characters or labels in the `netloc` value before encoding it.

Here's the corrected code for the `_safe_ParseResult` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import quote, urlparse

def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        to_native_str(parts.netloc.encode('idna').decode('utf-8')),  # Correcting the encoding issue

        # default encoding for path component SHOULD be UTF-8
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),

        # encoding of query and fragment follows page encoding
        # or form-charset (if known and passed)
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `netloc` value is first encoded with the 'idna' codec and then decoded using the 'utf-8' codec to ensure that the value is handled properly without any encoding issues.
