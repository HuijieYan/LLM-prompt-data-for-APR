Potential Error Location: 
The error is likely occurring in the encoding of the `netloc`, `path`, `params`, `query`, and `fragment` components of the URL. 

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the encoding for the `netloc`, `path`, `params`, `query`, and `fragment` components is being handled inconsistently, leading to potential encoding issues.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Ensure that consistent encoding is used for all components of the URL.
2. Handle encoding errors gracefully and provide fallback mechanisms if necessary.

Corrected Code:
```python
from urllib.parse import quote
from w3lib.util import to_native_str, to_bytes

def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf-8', path_encoding='utf-8'):
    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        to_native_str(parts.netloc.encode('idna')),

        # Default encoding for path component SHOULD be UTF-8
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), safe=_safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), safe=_safe_chars),

        # Encoding of query and fragment follows page encoding
        # or form-charset (if known and passed)
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), safe=_safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), safe=_safe_chars)
    )
```
