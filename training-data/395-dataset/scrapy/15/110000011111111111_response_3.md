The error occurs in the `_safe_ParseResult` function, specifically in the line `to_native_str(parts.netloc.encode('idna'))`. The error message indicates that there is a UnicodeError with the label being empty or too long.

The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that the `parts.netloc` value is being encoded using the 'idna' codec, which is used for internationalized domain names. However, when the value is not a valid domain name (such as in the test case where `parts.netloc` is '.example.com' or a very long domain name), this encoding process fails and raises a UnicodeError.

To fix this bug, the function should handle the case where `parts.netloc` is not a valid domain name. Instead of blindly trying to encode `parts.netloc` using 'idna' codec, the function should first check if `parts.netloc` is a valid domain name before attempting to encode it. If it is not a valid domain name, the function can handle it in an appropriate way, such as omitting it from the final result.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    netloc = parts.netloc
    if '@' in netloc:
        userpass, netloc = netloc.rsplit('@', 1)
    else:
        userpass = ''
    netloc = netloc.encode('idna').decode('ascii')
    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        netloc,
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
    )
```
