The error occurs when the `canonicalize_url` function is called and tries to encode the netloc using the 'idna' codec. This encoding process fails with a UnicodeError because the netloc contains an empty label or a label that is too long.

The reason behind this bug is that the netloc encoding using 'idna' is not handling cases where the label is empty or too long, resulting in a UnicodeError.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the cases where the label is empty or too long before attempting to encode the netloc using the 'idna' codec. We can use a try-except block to catch the UnicodeError and handle it gracefully, allowing the extraction of other good links to proceed even if there is a bad link in the response.

Here's the corrected code for the `_safe_ParseResult` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import quote, urlparse
import idna

def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    try:
        netloc = parts.netloc.encode('idna')
    except UnicodeError:
        netloc = '.'
    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        to_native_str(netloc),

        # default encoding for path component SHOULD be UTF-8
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),

        # encoding of query and fragment follows page encoding
        # or form-charset (if known and passed)
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
    )
```

In the corrected code, we handle the UnicodeError by replacing the netloc with a '.' if the encoding using 'idna' fails. This allows the extraction of other links to proceed even if there is a bad link in the response.
