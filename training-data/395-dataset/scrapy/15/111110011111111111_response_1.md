The error is occurring in the `_safe_ParseResult` function, particularly in the line `to_native_str(parts.netloc.encode('idna'))`. The `parts.netloc` value is being encoded using the `'idna'` codec, and it seems that there are cases where the label is either empty or too long, causing a `UnicodeError` to be raised.

This could be happening because the `parts.netloc` value is not valid for encoding using the 'idna' codec. In the context of URL parsing, it's possible that the netloc value might contain characters or patterns that are not valid for encoding using 'idna'.

To fix this issue, it's important to handle the encoding using the 'idna' codec more gracefully. One approach could be to catch the `UnicodeError` exception and handle it by either skipping the problematic `parts.netloc` value or transforming it in a way that makes it valid for encoding using 'idna'.

Here's the corrected `_safe_ParseResult` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import quote, urlparse

# Corrected function
def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    try:
        netloc_encoded = parts.netloc.encode('idna')
    except UnicodeError:
        # Handle the UnicodeError by creating a valid netloc value for idna encoding
        netloc_encoded = parts.netloc.encode('ascii', errors='ignore')
    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        to_native_str(netloc_encoded),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
    )
```

In the corrected function, we handle the `UnicodeError` exception by encoding the `netloc` value using ASCII with errors ignored in case the 'idna' encoding fails. This allows for graceful handling of problematic `netloc` values.
