Based on the given information, it appears that the issue arises from the _safe_ParseResult function in the `/Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_15/scrapy/utils/url.py` file. The function attempts to encode the parts.netloc using the 'idna' codec, leading to a UnicodeError with the message "label empty or too long." 

The possible reasons for this bug could be that the parts.netloc value is not compatible with the 'idna' codec or its length exceeds the allowed limit.

To address this issue, we can modify the _safe_ParseResult function to handle the 'idna' encoding more robustly. One approach is to catch the UnicodeError exception when encoding parts.netloc using the 'idna' codec and handle it appropriately, for example by ignoring the problematic netloc and proceeding with the remaining links.

Here's the corrected code for the _safe_ParseResult function:

```python
def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    try:
        netloc = to_native_str(parts.netloc.encode('idna'))
    except UnicodeError:
        netloc = ''  # Handle the UnicodeError by setting an empty value for netloc
    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        netloc,
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
    )
```

By handling the UnicodeError and setting an empty value for netloc when the 'idna' encoding fails, we can prevent the error from halting the processing of the remaining links.

This approach will allow the extraction of links to continue even if there are problematic netloc values, ensuring that all the other good links can be extracted.
