The bug in the provided function is due to the use of the to_bytes and quote functions. The netloc should be passed through idna encoding separately.

To fix the bug, we should encode the netloc using idna encoding before returning the result.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_15/scrapy/utils/url.py
def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        parts.netloc.encode('idna').decode('utf-8'), # encode netloc using idna and then decode it to utf-8

        # default encoding for path component SHOULD be UTF-8
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),

        # encoding of query and fragment follows page encoding
        # or form-charset (if known and passed)
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
    )
```
