Potential Error Location: The error seems to be occurring in the line `to_native_str(parts.netloc.encode('idna'))` inside the `_safe_ParseResult` function.

Reason for the Bug: The `encode` method is being called on `parts.netloc` with the `'idna'` codec. This is causing a UnicodeError with the message "label empty or too long." 

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if `parts.netloc` is empty or too long before encoding it with the 'idna' codec.
2. Ensure that the label length of `parts.netloc` is within the allowable limits for IDNA encoding, which is 63 characters.
3. Handle the UnicodeError gracefully and provide a meaningful error message or fallback mechanism when the encoding fails.

Corrected Code:

```python
def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    netloc_encoded = parts.netloc.encode('idna')
    if len(netloc_encoded) == 0 or len(netloc_encoded) > 63:
        raise ValueError("Invalid netloc for IDNA encoding")
    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        to_native_str(netloc_encoded),
        # default encoding for path component SHOULD be UTF-8
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        # encoding of query and fragment follows page encoding
        # or form-charset (if known and passed)
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
    )
```
