The error is occurring on the line `to_native_str(parts.netloc.encode('idna'))` in the `_safe_ParseResult` function. This is because the `netloc` is already a string, so there is no need to encode it with the 'idna' codec.

The `parts.netloc` attribute already contains the network location part of the URL, which is a string. The 'idna' codec is used for encoding and decoding domain names using the Internationalized Domain Names in Applications (IDNA) standards. It is not necessary to encode the netloc part of the URL using the 'idna' codec, as it's already a valid string.

To fix the bug, the line `to_native_str(parts.netloc.encode('idna'))` should be changed to `to_native_str(parts.netloc)` so that the netloc is not encoded with the 'idna' codec unnecessarily.

Here's the corrected code for the `_safe_ParseResult` function:

```python
def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        to_native_str(parts.netloc),

        # default encoding for path component SHOULD be UTF-8
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),

        # encoding of query and fragment follows page encoding
        # or form-charset (if known and passed)
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
    )
```
