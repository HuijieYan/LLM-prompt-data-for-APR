The error seems to be related to the encoding of the `netloc` attribute using `'idna'` encoding, which is causing a `UnicodeError` because of an empty or too long label.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `to_native_str(parts.netloc.encode('idna'))`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the netloc attribute might contain characters that are not valid for the 'idna' encoding, leading to the UnicodeError.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_safe_ParseResult` function to handle the encoding of the `netloc` attribute more carefully. We should also try to avoid encoding issues by using proper encoding methods.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from urllib.parse import quote, quote_from_bytes, urlparse, ParseResult
import idna

_safe_chars = '/~'
def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        to_native_str(parts.netloc),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
    )

def to_bytes(s, encoding):
    if s is not None:
        return s.encode(encoding)
    return s

def to_native_str(s):
    if s is not None:
        return str(s)
    return s
```

In this corrected code:
- We no longer need to encode the `netloc` using 'idna' because it's already a string, and encoding it would not be necessary for the purpose of the function.
- We've removed the unnecessary encoding and decoding steps and simplified the function by using the `to_bytes` and `to_native_str` helper functions to handle encoding and string conversion in a more consistent and safer way.
- We also added an import statement for the `idna` module, which may be used for encoding if required in other parts of the code.
