The error occurs in the `_safe_ParseResult` function, specifically in the line `to_native_str(parts.netloc.encode('idna'))`. The error message indicates that the encoding with the 'idna' codec failed and a UnicodeError was raised due to a label being empty or too long.

The reason behind this bug is that the value of `parts.netloc` includes the prefix dot (.), which is causing the failure during the encoding with the 'idna' codec.

To fix the bug, we need to remove the dot (.) from the `parts.netloc` value before encoding it with the 'idna' codec. This can be achieved using the `lstrip` method that removes leading characters from a string.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    netloc = parts.netloc.lstrip('.')
    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        to_native_str(netloc.encode('idna')),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
    )
```
