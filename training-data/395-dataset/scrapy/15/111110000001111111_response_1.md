Potential Error Location:
The error is occurring when trying to encode the netloc using 'idna' encoding.

Reasons for the Bug:
The 'idna' encoding is used to encode domain names containing non-ASCII characters, and it seems that the netloc value is either empty or too long, causing the UnicodeError to be raised.

Possible Approaches to Fix the Bug:
1. Check the length and content of the netloc before encoding it using 'idna'.
2. Handle the UnicodeError exception and continue processing the other links.

Corrected Code:

```python
from urllib.parse import quote, urlparse

_safe_chars = ''  # define _safe_chars as required

def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf-8', path_encoding='utf-8'):
    netloc = parts.netloc if parts.netloc else ''
    netloc_encoded = ''
    if len(netloc) <= 253:  # check length, as per the specification
        try:
            netloc_encoded = to_native_str(netloc.encode('idna'))
        except UnicodeError:
            pass  # handle the exception by skipping this netloc
    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        netloc_encoded,
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
    )
```
