The error message indicates a UnicodeError caused by encoding with the 'idna' codec failing due to a label being empty or too long. This error occurs at the line `to_native_str(parts.netloc.encode('idna'))` in the `_safe_ParseResult` function. The function is attempting to encode the `netloc` using the 'idna' codec and then convert it to the native string type, but it is encountering issues with the encoding process.

The bug occurs because the 'idna' encoding process is sensitive to the length of labels in the domain name. When the label is empty or too long, the 'idna' encoding fails, leading to the UnicodeError.

To fix this bug, a potential approach is to ensure that the `netloc` is properly validated before attempting to encode it using the 'idna' codec. This validation could involve checking the length of each label in the domain name to ensure that they comply with the restrictions for the 'idna' encoding.

Here's the corrected code for the `_safe_ParseResult` function:

```python
def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    netloc = parts.netloc
    if "." in netloc and all(0 < len(label) < 64 for label in netloc.split(".")):
        netloc = to_native_str(netloc.encode('idna'))
    else:
        # handle invalid netloc here (e.g., raise an error or use a default value)
        pass
    
    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        netloc,
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `netloc` is first checked to ensure that it contains a period (indicating a valid domain name) and that all the labels in the domain name have a length within the constraints for 'idna' encoding. If these conditions are met, the `netloc` is then encoded using the 'idna' codec and converted to the native string type. If the conditions are not met, you can choose to handle the invalid `netloc` in an appropriate manner (e.g., raising an error or using a default value).
