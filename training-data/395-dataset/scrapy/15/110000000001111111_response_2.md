The error is occurring in the `_safe_ParseResult` function when it tries to encode the `parts.netloc` using the 'idna' encoding. This encoding error occurs because the `parts.netloc` value is sometimes too long or empty, leading to the `UnicodeError` being raised.

This can be fixed by using a `try-except` block to catch the `UnicodeError` and handle it gracefully, allowing the function to continue execution without being interrupted by a single bad link in the response.

Here's the corrected code for the `_safe_ParseResult` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse, quote, quote_from_bytes

def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    try:
        netloc = to_native_str(parts.netloc.encode('idna'))
    except UnicodeError:
        netloc = ''  # or any other appropriate default value

    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        netloc,
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
    )
```

By using a `try-except` block, we can handle the `UnicodeError` and set a default value for `netloc` in case the encoding fails. This will prevent the function from crashing due to a single bad link in the response.
