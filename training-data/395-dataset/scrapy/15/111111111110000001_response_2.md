Potential error location: 
The error is likely pointed to the line "to_native_str(parts.netloc.encode('idna'))" inside the `_safe_ParseResult` function. This line is trying to encode the netloc part of the URL using the 'idna' encoding, which is causing the UnicodeError.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The 'idna' encoding is used for converting domain names to ASCII-compatible format, but in this case, the input domain name is invalid or too long, leading to the UnicodeError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Remove the encoding of the netloc using 'idna' if it's not necessary for the specific use case.
2. Check for valid domain names before encoding them using 'idna', and handle invalid or too long domain names as per the specific requirements.

Corrected code:

```python
def _safe_ParseResult(parts, encoding='utf8', path_encoding='utf8'):
    return (
        to_native_str(parts.scheme),
        to_native_str(parts.netloc),  # Remove encode('idna')

        # default encoding for path component SHOULD be UTF-8
        quote(to_bytes(parts.path, path_encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.params, path_encoding), _safe_chars),

        # encoding of query and fragment follows page encoding
        # or form-charset (if known and passed)
        quote(to_bytes(parts.query, encoding), _safe_chars),
        quote(to_bytes(parts.fragment, encoding), _safe_chars)
    )
```
