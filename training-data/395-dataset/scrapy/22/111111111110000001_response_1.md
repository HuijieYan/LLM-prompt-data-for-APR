The provided test case is trying to export an item and then compare it to an expected XML output. The error message indicates that the `_xg_characters` method is trying to decode a boolean value, which causes an AttributeError because booleans do not have a `decode` method.

The potential error location within the `_export_xml_field` method is the line:
```python
self._xg_characters(serialized_value)
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `_xg_characters` method is assuming that the serialized_value is a string and is trying to decode it, which is incorrect for non-string types.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to handle non-string types differently in the `_export_xml_field` method. Instead of trying to call `_xg_characters` on them, the method should convert them to a string representation and then write that representation to the XML. This will prevent any decoding errors.

Here's the corrected code for the `_export_xml_field` method:

```python
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif is_listlike(serialized_value):
        for value in serialized_value:
            if isinstance(value, bool):
                value = str(value).lower()  # Convert boolean to lowercase string representation
            self._export_xml_field('value', value)
    else:
        if isinstance(serialized_value, bool):
            serialized_value = str(serialized_value).lower()  # Convert boolean to lowercase string representation
        self._xg_characters(serialized_value)
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```

This corrected code includes special handling for non-string types by converting them to a string representation based on their type. This should prevent the AttributeError when trying to decode non-string types.
