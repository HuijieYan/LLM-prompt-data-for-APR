1. The test case is trying to export an item using the `export_item` method of the `XmlItemExporter` class. The error occurs when the exporter encounters a non-string type (`False`) in the serialized value.

2. The potential error location is likely within the `_xg_characters` method, where the error is thrown when trying to decode a non-string object.

3. The error occurs because the `_xg_characters` method assumes that the serialized_value is a string that needs to be decoded. However, in this case, the serialized_value is a boolean (`False`), which cannot be decoded.

4. One possible approach for fixing the bug is to handle non-string types within the `_export_xml_field` method and convert them to strings before passing them to the `_xg_characters` method. Additionally, the `_xg_characters` method can be modified to handle non-string types appropriately.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif is_listlike(serialized_value):
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', value)
    else:
        self._xg_characters(str(serialized_value))  # Convert non-string types to string before passing to _xg_characters
    self.xg.endElement(name)

def _xg_characters(self, serialized_value):
    if not isinstance(serialized_value, six.text_type):
        serialized_value = str(serialized_value)  # Convert non-string types to string
    self.xg.characters(serialized_value)
``` 

By converting non-string types to strings before passing them to the `_xg_characters` method, we ensure that the method can handle any type of input correctly.
