The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError in the `_xg_characters` method of the `XmlItemExporter` class. The error occurs because the method is trying to decode a boolean value but boolean values do not have a `decode` method.

The potential error location is within the `_xg_characters` method, specifically at the line where it tries to decode the boolean value.

The bug occurs because the code does not check the type of `serialized_value` before attempting to decode it. As a result, if `serialized_value` is a boolean or another non-decodable type, it will raise an AttributeError.

To fix the bug, the code should first check the type of `serialized_value` to ensure that it is decodable before attempting to decode it. If it is not decodable, it should be handled appropriately (e.g., converted to a string if necessary).

Here is the corrected code for the `_export_xml_field` method:

```python
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif is_listlike(serialized_value):
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', value)
    else:
        if isinstance(serialized_value, six.text_type):
            self._xg_characters(serialized_value)
        else:
            self._xg_characters(str(serialized_value))
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```
