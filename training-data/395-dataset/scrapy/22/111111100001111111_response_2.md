The bug occurs in the `_export_xml_field` function of the `XmlItemExporter` class. The error message indicates that the issue is with the `serialize_value` and the `decode` method, suggesting that the error is related to the attempt to decode non-string types.

The issue occurs because the `_xg_characters` method is being called with non-string types such as bool, int, and datetime. The `_xg_characters` method attempts to decode these non-string types which results in the AttributeError.

To fix the bug, we need to handle non-string types differently in the `_export_xml_field` method. Instead of calling `_xg_characters` for non-string types, we should convert them to string before passing them to `_xg_characters`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_export_xml_field` method:

```python
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif is_listlike(serialized_value):
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', value)
    else:
        self._xg_characters(str(serialized_value))  # Convert to string before passing to _xg_characters
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```

By converting non-string types to string before passing them to `_xg_characters`, we ensure that the `_xg_characters` method does not attempt to decode non-string types. This should resolve the AttributeError when exporting non-string types through XMLFeedExporter.
