The error occurs when the `_xg_characters` method is called with a non-string serialized_value, such as integers, booleans, or datetime objects. The `_xg_characters` method attempts to call the `decode` method on the serialized_value, which causes an AttributeError for non-string types.

To fix this issue, we should modify the `_export_xml_field` method to handle non-string serialized values properly. We can check the type of `serialized_value` and take different actions accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_export_xml_field` method:

```python
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif isinstance(serialized_value, bool):
        self._xg_characters(str(serialized_value).lower())
    elif isinstance(serialized_value, (int, float)):
        self._xg_characters(str(serialized_value))
    elif hasattr(serialized_value, 'isoformat'):
        self._xg_characters(serialized_value.isoformat())
    else:
        self._xg_characters(serialized_value)
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```

In this corrected code:
- For dictionaries, it continues to call `_export_xml_field` for each key-value pair.
- For booleans, it converts the boolean to a string representation and then calls `_xg_characters`.
- For integers and floats, it converts them to strings and then calls `_xg_characters`.
- For datetime objects, it uses the `isoformat` method to get the datetime in a string representation and then calls `_xg_characters`.
- For any other types, it directly calls `_xg_characters`.

With these changes, the `_export_xml_field` method should properly handle non-string serialized values, preventing the AttributeError mentioned in the issue description.
