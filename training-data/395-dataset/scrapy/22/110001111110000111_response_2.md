The test case `test_nonstring_types_item` is failing with the error AttributeError: 'bool' object has no attribute 'decode'. This error suggests that there is an attempt to call the `decode` method on a boolean object, which is not allowed.

The potential error location is within the `_xg_characters` method, where the `decode` method is being called on the `serialized_value`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that when a boolean value is encountered, it is being passed to the `_xg_characters` method, which in turn tries to decode it, leading to the AttributeError.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to handle boolean values separately in the `_export_xml_field` method, and not pass them to `_xg_characters`. Instead, they should be directly written as XML elements.

Here's the corrected code for the `_export_xml_field` method:

```python
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif is_listlike(serialized_value):
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', value)
    elif isinstance(serialized_value, bool):
        self.xg.characters(str(serialized_value).lower())
    else:
        self._xg_characters(serialized_value)
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```

By adding the condition `elif isinstance(serialized_value, bool):` and handling boolean values separately in the `_export_xml_field` method, we can avoid passing them to `_xg_characters` and resolve the AttributeError.
