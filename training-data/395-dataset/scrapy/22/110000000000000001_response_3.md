Potential error location: The potential error is in the if-elif-else statement. The condition for checking if the serialized_value is listlike is missing, and the method _xg_characters should be called using self rather than _xg.

Reasons behind the bug: The bug is caused by not handling the case when the serialized_value is a list-like object. Additionally, the method _xg_characters should be called using self.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Add a condition to check if the serialized_value is list-like.
2. Modify the method call to _xg_characters to use self instead of _xg.

Corrected code:

```python
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif is_listlike(serialized_value):
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', value)
    else:
        self.xg.characters(serialized_value)
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```
