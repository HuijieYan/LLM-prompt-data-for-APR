The error message suggests that the 'int' object does not have an attribute 'decode', which is called in the function _xg_characters. This means that the code is trying to decode an integer, which is not possible.

To fix this bug, the _xg_characters function needs to handle non-string types differently. It should encode the non-string types in a way that is appropriate for XML output, rather than trying to decode them.

Here's the corrected code for the _export_xml_field function:

```python
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif isinstance(serialized_value, (list, tuple)):
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', value)
    elif isinstance(serialized_value, (int, bool, float)):
        self._xg_characters(str(serialized_value))
    else:
        self._xg_characters(serialized_value)
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```
