Potential error location: The code is calling a method `_xg_characters` that seems to be a typo as there are two identical methods with the same name `_xg_characters`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug is occurring because the `_xg_characters` method is being called within the `_export_xml_field` method, but there are no implementations provided for the `_xg_characters` method.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Provide an implementation for the `_xg_characters` method.
2. Correct any typos and ensure that the method being called is the correct one.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif is_listlike(serialized_value):
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', value)
    else:
        self.xg.characters(serialized_value)  # Corrected method name from _xg_characters to characters
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```
