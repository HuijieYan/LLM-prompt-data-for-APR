The potential error location within the problematic function is near the line "self._xg_characters(serialized_value)". The error message indicates that the code is attempting to decode an 'int' object, which means that "serialized_value" is an integer in this case.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the "_xg_characters" method is attempting to decode a non-string object (in this case, an integer) using the "decode" method, which is only applicable to string objects.

To fix the bug, you can modify the code in the "_xg_characters" method to handle non-string objects properly, without attempting to decode them.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the fixed function
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif is_listlike(serialized_value):
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', value)
    else:
        self._xg_characters(str(serialized_value))
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```

In the fixed code, before calling "_xg_characters" method, we convert the "serialized_value" to a string using the "str" function. This will ensure that the "_xg_characters" method does not attempt to decode non-string objects.
