Potential Error Location: The error seems to be occurring in the `_xg_characters` method when trying to decode the `serialized_value` which is a boolean.

Reason for the Bug: The bug is occurring because the `_xg_characters` method is trying to decode a non-string data type (boolean) which does not have a `decode` method.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the data type of `serialized_value` before attempting to decode it.
2. If the data type is not a string, handle it appropriately (e.g., convert it to a string) before further processing.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif is_listlike(serialized_value):
        for value in serialized_value:
            if isinstance(value, bool):  # Check if the value is a boolean
                value = str(value)  # Convert boolean to string
            self._export_xml_field('value', value)
    else:
        self._xg_characters(serialized_value)
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```
