Potential Error Location:
The potential error lies in the line `self.xg.endElement(name)`. It seems that the function `_xg_characters` is meant to be called, but it is mistakenly written as `_xg_characters`.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The function `_export_xml_field` is intended to export fields to an XML file using an XMLGenerator. However, the bug occurs because there is a typo in the function call `_xg_characters`, which should actually be `self.xg.characters`.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Replace `_xg_characters` with `self.xg.characters` to correctly call the function for adding character data to the XML file.
2. Check for any other potential typos or incorrect function calls within the `_export_xml_field` function.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif is_listlike(serialized_value):
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', value)
    else:
        self.xg.characters(str(serialized_value))  # Using self.xg.characters instead of _xg_characters
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```
