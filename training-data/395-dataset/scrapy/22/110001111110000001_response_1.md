The error occurs during the execution of the test case `test_nonstring_types_item` in the `test_exporters.py` file. In this test case, the `assertExportResult` method is called to compare the expected exported XML data with the actual exported data using the `export_item` method of the `XmlItemExporter`.

The error message indicates that the `_xg_characters` method is trying to decode a boolean object, which is not allowed because boolean objects do not have a `decode` method.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `_export_xml_field` method where the `_xg_characters` method is called to process the serialized value.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `_xg_characters` method is not handling non-string types such as boolean correctly, causing the `decode` method error.

To fix the bug, the `_xg_characters` method should be modified to handle non-string types gracefully.

Here's the corrected code for the `_export_xml_field` method:

```python
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif is_listlike(serialized_value):
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', value)
    else:
        if isinstance(serialized_value, bool):  # check if the serialized_value is a boolean
            serialized_value = str(serialized_value).lower()  # convert boolean to lowercase string
        self._xg_characters(str(serialized_value))  # convert the value to string before passing to _xg_characters
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```

With this corrected code, the `_xg_characters` method will handle non-string types such as boolean by converting them to lowercase strings before processing them further.
