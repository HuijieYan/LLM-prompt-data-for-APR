The error occurs when the function `_export_xml_field` is called to export items to XML that have non-string types. The error message indicates that the issue is related to the `self._xg_characters(serialized_value)` line within the `_export_xml_field` function. This suggests that the problem is with how non-string types are handled when exporting to XML.

The potential error location is the `self._xg_characters(serialized_value)` line within the `_export_xml_field` function. This line is attempting to decode the `serialized_value` using the `self.encoding` attribute, which does not exist in the given context.

The bug occurs because the function attempts to decode non-string types using the non-existent `self.encoding` attribute, leading to the `AttributeError`.

To fix this bug, the `_xg_characters` function should be modified to handle the different data types appropriately. For non-string types, a check should be implemented to handle them differently rather than trying to decode them.

Below is the corrected code for the `_export_xml_field` function:

```python
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items') and not isinstance(serialized_value, str):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif is_listlike(serialized_value) and not isinstance(serialized_value, str):
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', value)
    else:
        if isinstance(serialized_value, str):
            self._xg_characters(serialized_value)
        else:
            self._xg_characters(str(serialized_value))
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```

In the corrected code, a check is added to handle non-string types appropriately by converting them to strings before passing them to the `_xg_characters` function. This ensures that non-string types are handled correctly during XML export.
