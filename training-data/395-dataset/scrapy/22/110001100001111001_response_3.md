The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line `self._xg_characters(serialized_value)`, as it seems to be calling a method `_xg_characters` that is not defined within the provided code snippet.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is trying to call a method `_xg_characters` which is not defined, causing a NameError.

To fix the bug, the `_xg_characters` method should be defined within the class. Below is the corrected code for the problematic function including the `_xg_characters` method:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_22/scrapy/exporters.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def _xg_characters(self, serialized_value):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def _xg_characters(self, serialized_value):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# Corrected code for the problematic function
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif is_listlike(serialized_value):
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', value)
    else:
        self._xg_characters(serialized_value)
    self.xg.endElement(name)

def _xg_characters(self, serialized_value):
    # Define the behavior of _xg_characters method
    pass
```
