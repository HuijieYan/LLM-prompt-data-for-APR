1. The test case involves exporting items to XML, and the items have non-string types such as integers, boolean, and datetime. The error message indicates an AttributeError related to the 'decode' method when trying to export non-string types.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the line that attempts to decode `serialized_value`.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code is trying to decode a non-string type (in this case, an integer) using the `decode` method, which is only applicable to string types. This causes the AttributeError.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the type of `serialized_value` before attempting to decode it. If it's not a string type, handle it accordingly without attempting to decode it.
   - Convert non-string types to string before passing them to `_xg_characters` for further processing.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif is_listlike(serialized_value):
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', value)
    else:
        # Check if serialized_value is a string type, if not, convert it to string
        if not isinstance(serialized_value, str):
            serialized_value = str(serialized_value)
        self._xg_characters(serialized_value)
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```
