The error message is indicating that the function `_xg_characters` is trying to call the `decode` method on a boolean object, which is causing an AttributeError. This points to the fact that the code is not handling boolean values properly.

The potential error location within the problematic function is when checking the type of the serialized_value and then attempting to call `_xg_characters` for non-string types.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function `_xg_characters` is not handling non-string types properly.

To fix this bug, we need to update the function `_export_xml_field` to handle boolean and non-string types properly, and avoid calling `_xg_characters` for non-string types.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif isinstance(serialized_value, bool):
        self.xg.characters(str(serialized_value))
    elif is_listlike(serialized_value):
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', value)
    else:
        self._xg_characters(serialized_value)
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```
