The error occurs when the `_xg_characters` method tries to decode a boolean value, which is not possible because boolean values do not have a `decode` method. This happens because the `_xg_characters` method assumes that the `serialized_value` is of type `six.text_type`, which is not always the case.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_xg_characters` method so that it can handle non-textual data types such as boolean, integers, floats, and datetime objects.

Here's the corrected code for the `_export_xml_field` method:

```python
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif is_listlike(serialized_value):
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', value)
    else:
        self._xg_characters(str(serialized_value))
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```

In the above code, we convert the `serialized_value` to a string using `str(serialized_value)`. This will handle all data types including boolean, integer, float, and datetime objects, and will prevent the `AttributeError` that was occurring previously.

With this fix, the `_export_xml_field` method should be able to handle non-textual data types and prevent the error from occurring.
