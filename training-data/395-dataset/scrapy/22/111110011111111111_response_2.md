The error occurs when trying to decode a non-string type when exporting to XML. This is because the code attempts to decode the serialized_value using the self.encoding, which is not suitable for non-string types like integers and booleans.

To fix the bug, we need to handle non-string types differently in the _export_xml_field function. We can update the function to check if the serialized_value is a string before trying to decode it. If it is not a string, we can directly convert it to a string before exporting it.

Here's the corrected code for the _export_xml_field function:

```python
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif isinstance(serialized_value, (list, tuple)):
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', value)
    else:
        if isinstance(serialized_value, str):
            self._xg_characters(serialized_value)
        else:
            self._xg_characters(str(serialized_value))
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```

With this update, we first check if the serialized_value is a string. If it is, we use the _xg_characters function as before. If not, we convert the serialized_value to a string and then use the _xg_characters function to export it. This change ensures that non-string types are handled properly when exporting to XML.
