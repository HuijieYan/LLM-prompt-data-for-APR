Based on the input parameters and the error message, it seems that the issue is occurring when the `_xg_characters` method is trying to decode a non-string type, such as bool or int, which causes an AttributeError.

The bug occurs because the `_xg_characters` method is assuming that the serialized_value is always a string and tries to decode it using the `decode` method. This is not suitable for non-string types like bool or int.

To fix this bug, we should modify the code to handle non-string types differently. We can convert non-string types to strings before passing them to the `_xg_characters` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `_export_xml_field` method:

```python
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif is_listlike(serialized_value):
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', value)
    else:
        if isinstance(serialized_value, (bool, int, float)):
            serialized_value = str(serialized_value)
        self._xg_characters(serialized_value)
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```

In the corrected code, before passing the serialized_value to the `_xg_characters` method, we convert bool, int, and float types to strings using the `str()` function.

This fix should resolve the AttributeError when trying to export non-string types through XMLFeedExporter.
