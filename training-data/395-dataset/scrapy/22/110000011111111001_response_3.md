The error occurs in the `_xg_characters` method when the `serialized_value` is of type `bool` and the function tries to decode it, which results in an AttributeError.

To fix this issue, the `_export_xml_field` method needs to handle the case when the `serialized_value` is of type `bool` and directly write it to the XML instead of trying to decode it.

Here's the corrected `_export_xml_field` method:

```python
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif isinstance(serialized_value, (list, tuple)):
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', value)
    else:
        self.xg.characters(str(serialized_value))  # directly write the value to XML as a string
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```

With this correction, when the `serialized_value` is of type `bool`, `int`, `float`, or any other non-list like type, it will be directly written to the XML as a string using `self.xg.characters`.
