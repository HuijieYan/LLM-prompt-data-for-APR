Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to be occurring in the `_export_xml_field` function within the `XmlItemExporter` class. Specifically, in the line `self._export_xml_field('value', value)`, if `serialized_value` is a list.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because when `serialized_value` is a list, the function recursively calls itself with the same parameters. This can lead to infinite recursion and stack overflow.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we can add a check to ensure that if `serialized_value` is a list, we handle it appropriately without recursively calling the function with the same parameters.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif isinstance(serialized_value, list):  # Check if serialized_value is a list
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._xg_characters(value)  # Call the _xg_characters method directly
    else:
        self._xg_characters(serialized_value)
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```
