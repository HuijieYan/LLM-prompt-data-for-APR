The test case is trying to export an item to XML, but the exporter fails when the item contains non-string types such as boolean values or integers.

The error message indicates that the error occurs when the function `_xg_characters` tries to call the `decode` method on a non-text serialized value, resulting in an AttributeError.

The bug occurs because the code assumes that the serialized value is always a string, so it tries to decode it, which is not valid for non-string types like boolean or integer.

To fix the bug, the code needs to handle non-string serialized values differently. Instead of trying to decode the values, the code should simply convert them to string representations.

Here's the corrected code for the `_export_xml_field` function:
```python
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif is_listlike(serialized_value):
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', value)
    else:
        self._xg_characters(str(serialized_value))  # Convert non-string values to string before passing to _xg_characters
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```
