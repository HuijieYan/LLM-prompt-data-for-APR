The issue with the provided function is that it is missing the definition for the `is_listlike` function, which is presumably intended to check if the `serialized_value` is list-like. Additionally, there are multiple definition of the `_xg_characters` function, which is not allowed in Python.

To fix the issue, a simple approach would be to define the `is_listlike` function or use the built-in `isinstance()` function to check if `serialized_value` is list-like. Furthermore, we need to remove the extra definitions of the `_xg_characters` function to avoid conflicts.

Here's the corrected code for the `_export_xml_field` function:

```python
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif isinstance(serialized_value, (list, tuple)):
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', value)
    else:
        self.xg.characters(str(serialized_value))
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```
