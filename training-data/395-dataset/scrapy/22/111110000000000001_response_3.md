Potential error location: The potential error location is in the `_export_xml_field` function, specifically in the line `self._xg_characters(serialized_value)`. It appears that the `_xg_characters` function is being called, but there are multiple functions with the same name in the class, which is not allowed.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because there are multiple functions with the same name (`_xg_characters`) in the class `XmlItemExporter`. This causes ambiguity and confusion when trying to call the correct function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: To fix the bug, we need to rename one of the functions with the same name to make them unique within the class. Then we need to update the function call in the `_export_xml_field` function to match the new function name.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif is_listlike(serialized_value):
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', value)
    else:
        self._xg_characters(serialized_value)
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```
