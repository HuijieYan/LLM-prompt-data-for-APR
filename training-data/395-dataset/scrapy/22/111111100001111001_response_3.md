The bug in the `_export_xml_field` function seems to be related to the use of `self.xg`. From the function and the test cases, it appears that `self.xg` should be used to generate XML tags, but the buggy code does not use it as intended.

The function should create XML tags using `self.xg` based on the `name` and `serialized_value` provided. However, the current implementation does not utilize `self.xg` correctly, leading to incorrect XML tag generation.

To fix the bug, the code should use `self.xg` to start and end XML elements based on the `name` and `serialized_value` parameters. All other recursive calls and iterations to process different types of `serialized_value` seem to be correctly implemented.

Here's the corrected code for the `_export_xml_field` method:

```python
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif is_listlike(serialized_value):
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', value)
    else:
        self.xg.characters(str(serialized_value))
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```

In this corrected code, `self.xg.startElement` is used to start an XML element with the given `name`, `self.xg.characters` is used to set the content of the XML element to the `serialized_value`, and `self.xg.endElement` is used to end the XML element.

With these corrections, the function should now properly utilize `self.xg` to create the desired XML structure based on the input parameters, resolving the bug.
