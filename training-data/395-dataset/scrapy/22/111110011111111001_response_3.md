The error is occurring in the `_xg_characters` method, where it is trying to decode a boolean object, which is not valid.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `_xg_characters` method, where it is trying to decode a boolean object using the `decode` method.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the method is assuming the serialized_value to be of type `six.text_type` and is trying to decode it, which is not applicable for boolean or other non-text types.

To fix this bug, we need to handle different types of `serialized_value` appropriately without assuming it to be a text type. We can directly convert it to a string and write it to the XML.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
    self.xg.startElement(name, {})
    if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
        for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
            self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
    elif is_listlike(serialized_value):
        for value in serialized_value:
            self._export_xml_field('value', value)
    else:
        # Convert the serialized_value to a string and write it to the XML
        self._xg_characters(str(serialized_value))
    self.xg.endElement(name)
```
