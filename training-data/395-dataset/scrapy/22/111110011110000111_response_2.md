1. The test case is trying to export non-string types to XML using the `XmlItemExporter` class. The specific error message highlights an `AttributeError` when the `boolean` value is being exported.

2. The potential error location within the `XmlItemExporter` class is in the `_xg_characters` method, where an attempt to decode a non-string value is made.

3. The occurrence of the bug is due to the assumption that all values being exported will be strings. When the exporter encounters non-string values, like boolean or integer, it attempts to decode them, resulting in an `AttributeError`.

4. To fix the bug, the exporter should handle non-string values differently. It should directly add them as text content within the XML element, without attempting to decode them.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `XmlItemExporter` class with the bug fixed:

```python
class XmlItemExporter(BaseItemExporter):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _export_xml_field(self, name, serialized_value):
        self.xg.startElement(name, {})
        if hasattr(serialized_value, 'items'):
            for subname, value in serialized_value.items():
                self._export_xml_field(subname, value)
        elif is_listlike(serialized_value):
            for value in serialized_value:
                self._export_xml_field('value', value)
        else:
            self.xg.characters(str(serialized_value))  # Directly add non-string values as text content
        self.xg.endElement(name)
```

In the corrected code, the `_export_xml_field` method has been modified to directly add non-string values as text content using the `self.xg.characters(str(serialized_value))` statement, ensuring that non-string values are handled properly.
