Potential Error Location: The potential error location is the `urlparse_cached` function, as it is not defined in the given code.

Reasons behind the Bug: The `urlparse_cached` function is not defined in the given code, which leads to a NameError when trying to execute the `get_origin_req_host` function.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: The `urlparse_cached` function needs to be imported and defined properly before it can be used in the `get_origin_req_host` function.

Corrected Code:
```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse

# Corrected function
def get_origin_req_host(self):
    return urlparse(self.request).hostname
```
In the corrected code, the `urlparse` function is imported from `urllib.parse`, and it is used to parse the request URL in the `get_origin_req_host` function to extract the hostname.
