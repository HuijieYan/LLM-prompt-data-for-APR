The error message indicates that there is no attribute 'origin_req_host' in the 'WrappedRequest' object, which is being accessed in the test function test_get_origin_req_host. This suggests that the 'origin_req_host' attribute is not being set within the get_origin_req_host function as expected.

The potential error location within the get_origin_req_host function is the return statement:
```python
return urlparse_cached(self.request).hostname
```
It seems that 'origin_req_host' is not being set or updated within the get_origin_req_host function.

The reason behind this bug could be that the 'origin_req_host' attribute is missing or not being updated correctly within the get_origin_req_host function. This is causing the AttributeError when accessing 'origin_req_host' in the test function.

One possible approach for fixing this bug is to update the 'origin_req_host' attribute within the get_origin_req_host function before returning it.

Here's the corrected code for the get_origin_req_host function:

```python
def get_origin_req_host(self):
    self.origin_req_host = urlparse_cached(self.request).hostname
    return self.origin_req_host
```
