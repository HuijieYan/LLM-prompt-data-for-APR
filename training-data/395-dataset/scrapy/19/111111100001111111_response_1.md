The error is occurring in the `get_origin_req_host` function of the `WrappedRequest` class in the `cookies.py` file. It is likely that the bug is causing an AttributeError when trying to access the `type` attribute of the `request` object.

It seems that the `request` object in the `WrappedRequest` class is an instance of the `Request` class from the `scrapy` library. The bug is likely due to a missing or incorrect reference to the attribute `type` of the `request` object.

To fix this bug, the `get_origin_req_host` function should be modified to access the `url`, and then parse the hostname from the URL.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_origin_req_host` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse

class WrappedRequest(object):
    """
    Wraps a scrapy Request class with methods defined by urllib2.Request class to interact with CookieJar class
    
    see http://docs.python.org/library/urllib2.html#urllib2.Request
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def get_origin_req_host(self):
        return urlparse(self.request.url).hostname
```
