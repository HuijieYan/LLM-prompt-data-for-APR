Potential error location:
The error is likely occurring in the `urlparse_cached` function, which is being used to extract the hostname from the request URL.

Reasons behind the bug:
The bug is likely occurring because the `urlparse_cached` function is not handling the input `self.request` properly, resulting in a `None` value being returned.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
We need to ensure that the `urlparse_cached` function is able to properly handle the `self.request` input and extract the hostname from the request URL.

Corrected code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_19/scrapy/http/cookies.py

from scrapy.utils.url import urlparse_cached

# corrected function
def get_origin_req_host(self):
    return urlparse_cached(self.request).hostname
```
