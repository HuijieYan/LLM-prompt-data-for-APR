The buggy function `get_origin_req_host` is supposed to return the hostname of the origin request. However, the current implementation is incorrect as it tries to access the `hostname` attribute directly from the result of the `urlparse_cached` function, which is not the correct way to retrieve the hostname.

The bug occurs because the `urlparse_cached` function is not returning the expected value or the expected type. It seems that the `urlparse_cached` function is not handling the provided input parameters (`self.request`) correctly.

To fix the buggy function, we need to correctly extract the hostname from the URL of the origin request. This can be achieved by using the `urlparse` function from the `urllib.parse` module, which correctly parses the URL and allows access to its components.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_origin_req_host` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse

def get_origin_req_host(self):
    url = self.request.url
    parsed_url = urlparse(url)
    return parsed_url.hostname
```

In the corrected code, we first retrieve the URL from `self.request` and then use `urlparse` to parse the URL and extract the hostname. This approach ensures that we correctly retrieve the origin request hostname.
