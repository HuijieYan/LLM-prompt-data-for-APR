The error occurs in the `get_origin_req_host` method within the `cookies.py` file of the Scrapy library. It seems that the `WrappedRequest` object does not have an attribute called `hostname`, which causes the AttributeError.

The bug is likely caused by a mismatch between the `Request` and `WrappedRequest` objects, leading to incorrect attribute access. `WrappedRequest` is not a straightforward proxy of the original `scrapy.http.Request` object. Therefore, directly accessing attributes of the underlying `Request` object from `WrappedRequest` may lead to attribute errors.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the `get_origin_req_host` method to access the hostname attribute directly from the `Request` object instead of the `WrappedRequest` object. Additionally, it may be necessary to handle cases where the `Request` object may not have a hostname attribute, to prevent potential AttributeError.

Below is the corrected code for the `get_origin_req_host` method:

```python
from scrapy.utils.url import urlparse_cached

def get_origin_req_host(self):
    return urlparse_cached(self.request.url).hostname
```
