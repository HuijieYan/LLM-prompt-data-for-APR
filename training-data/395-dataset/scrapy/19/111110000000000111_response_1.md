Based on the error message and the provided code, it seems that the issue is with the `get_origin_req_host` function in the `WrappedRequest` class. The error message specifically mentions that the 'WrappedRequest' object has no attribute 'type', indicating that the issue may be related to the 'type' attribute in the function. 

Upon closer inspection, it appears that the issue is with the usage of `self.request` in the `get_origin_req_host` function. This could be because `self.request` is not defined within the class, leading to the AttributeError.

To fix this bug, one possible approach is to properly define `self.request` within the `WrappedRequest` class. This could involve initializing `self.request` as an instance variable within the class, or passing it as an argument to the function.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_origin_req_host` function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse

class WrappedRequest(object):
    """
    Wraps a scrapy Request class with methods defined by urllib2.Request class to interact with CookieJar class
    """

    def __init__(self, request):
        self.request = request

    def get_origin_req_host(self):
        return urlparse(self.request.url).hostname
```

In this corrected code, the `__init__` method is used to initialize the `self.request` variable, and the `urlparse` function from the `urllib.parse` module is used to extract the hostname from the request URL.
