The error message indicates that the 'WrappedRequest' object has no attribute 'origin_req_host', and it is being checked in the test function.

The error is likely located within the 'get_origin_req_host' function. This function is trying to return the hostname of the request using the 'urlparse_cached' function, but it seems that the attribute 'origin_req_host' is missing.

The bug occurs because the 'origin_req_host' attribute is being accessed but has not been defined within the 'get_origin_req_host' function.

To fix this bug, the 'origin_req_host' attribute needs to be added to the 'get_origin_req_host' function to ensure that it is returned correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def get_origin_req_host(self):
    return self.origin_req_host
```

By returning the 'origin_req_host' attribute directly, the function will provide the correct result when called.
