Potential Error Location: The error is likely occurring in the `get_origin_req_host` method, specifically in the `urlparse_cached` function call.

Reason for the Bug: The `urlparse_cached` function is likely returning an unexpected or incorrect value, leading to the error.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the implementation of the `urlparse_cached` function to ensure it is correctly extracting the hostname from the request URL.
2. Verify that the `self.request` object is being passed to the `get_origin_req_host` method correctly and contains the expected URL information.
3. Ensure that the `urlparse_cached` function is handling edge cases and various URL formats properly.

Corrected Code:
```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse

# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_19/scrapy/http/cookies.py

# corrected function
def get_origin_req_host(self):
    return urlparse(self.request.url).hostname
```
