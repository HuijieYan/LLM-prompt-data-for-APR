# Corrected function source code
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_19/scrapy/http/cookies.py

# class declaration containing the corrected function
class WrappedRequest(object):
    """
    Wraps a scrapy Request class with methods defined by urllib2.Request class to interact with CookieJar class
    
    see http://docs.python.org/library/urllib2.html#urllib2.Request
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # this is the corrected function
    def get_origin_req_host(self):
        return urlparse_cached(self.request).hostname
    # additional attribute
    @property
    def origin_req_host(self):
        return urlparse_cached(self.request).hostname
    
```

The issue with the corrected function is that the `origin_req_host` was not defined. It is important to add `@property` tag before `origin_req_host` method definition.

The `@property` decorator is used to define properties in Python. Properties are a special kind of attribute that can get calculated value dynamically. When we use property attributes, the getter method is called when the attribute is accessed.
