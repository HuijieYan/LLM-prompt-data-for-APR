The error is occurring because the `get_origin_req_host` method is attempting to retrieve the `hostname` attribute from the result of the `urlparse_cached` function, which returns a `ParseResult` object. However, the `hostname` attribute is not present in the `ParseResult` object, leading to the `AttributeError`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `get_origin_req_host` method to correctly retrieve the hostname from the request URL.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_origin_req_host` method:

```python
def get_origin_req_host(self):
    return urlparse_cached(self.request).netloc
```

By using the `netloc` attribute instead of `hostname`, we can retrieve the correct host value from the parsed URL. This should fix the bug and prevent the `AttributeError` from occurring.
