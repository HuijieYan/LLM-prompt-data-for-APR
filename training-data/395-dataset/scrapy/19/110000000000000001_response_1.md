Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the `urlparse_cached` function call, as the `hostname` attribute is not directly available on the result of this function.

Reason for the bug: The `urlparse_cached` function is likely not returning the expected result, which is resulting in the attempt to access the `hostname` attribute causing an error.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: The `urlparse_cached` function should be used to parse the request URL, and then the `hostname` attribute should be accessed from the parsed result.

Corrected code:

```python
# corrected function
from urllib.parse import urlparse

def get_origin_req_host(self):
    parsed_url = urlparse(self.request)
    return parsed_url.hostname
```
