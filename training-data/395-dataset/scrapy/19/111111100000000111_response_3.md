The error is occurring in the `get_origin_req_host` function of the `WrappedRequest` class. The error message indicates that the 'WrappedRequest' object has no attribute 'type', which is causing the AttributeError. This means that the 'request' object does not have a 'type' attribute.

This issue is caused by the fact that the 'request' object is being used without proper initialization or attribute definition. It's likely that the 'request' object is not being passed correctly to the `WrappedRequest` class, resulting in the missing 'type' attribute.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the 'request' object is correctly initialized and passed to the `WrappedRequest` class.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse

class WrappedRequest(object):
    """
    Wraps a scrapy Request class with methods defined by urllib2.Request class to interact with CookieJar class
    
    see http://docs.python.org/library/urllib2.html#urllib2.Request
    """

    def __init__(self, request):
        self.request = request

    def get_origin_req_host(self):
        return urlparse(self.request.url).hostname
```

In the corrected code:
- We import `urlparse` from `urllib.parse` rather than using `urlparse_cached`, which seems to be a custom function not provided in the code snippet.
- We add an `__init__` method to initialize the `request` attribute when creating a `WrappedRequest` object.
- We use `urlparse` to parse the URL from the `request` object and retrieve the hostname.

These changes should help resolve the issue and prevent the AttributeError from occurring.
