The error occurs when trying to access the attribute 'type' of the 'request' object. This attribute does not exist in the 'WrappedRequest' class. The bug is likely caused by a mismatch between the expected attributes of the 'request' object and the actual attributes available in the 'WrappedRequest' class.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the 'WrappedRequest' class has a method to access the 'type' attribute or remove the reference to 'type' from the 'get_origin_req_host' method.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from scrapy.http import Request

# class declaration containing the corrected function
class WrappedRequest(object):
    """
    Wraps a scrapy Request class with methods defined by urllib2.Request class to interact with CookieJar class
    
    see http://docs.python.org/library/urllib2.html#urllib2.Request
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def get_origin_req_host(self):
        return urlparse_cached(self.request).hostname

    # Add a new method to retrieve the type of request
    def get_request_type(self):
        if isinstance(self.request, Request):
            return self.request.method
        else:
            return None
```

In the corrected code, a new method `get_request_type` is added to the `WrappedRequest` class to retrieve the type of the request. This method returns the type of the request, which is based on the `method` attribute in the `Request` class. This avoids the AttributeError caused by trying to access the 'type' attribute directly from the `WrappedRequest` object.
