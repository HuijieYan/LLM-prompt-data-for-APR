Analysis:
The test case is checking the origin_req_host attribute of the WrappedRequest class. However, the error message indicates that the AttributeError is due to the 'origin_req_host' attribute not being found.

Error Location:
The problematic function 'get_origin_req_host' is attempting to access the hostname of the request using the 'urlparse_cached' function. The issue likely lies within the 'urlparse_cached' function or the request object itself.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug is occurring due to the absence of the 'origin_req_host' attribute, which indicates that the request object is not being properly initialized or is missing required attributes.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the request object initialization to ensure that all necessary attributes, including 'origin_req_host', are created.
2. If 'origin_req_host' is not available directly, extract the hostname from the request URL itself.
3. Review the 'urlparse_cached' function to ensure it returns the proper attributes.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse

class WrappedRequest(object):
    """
    Wraps a scrapy Request class with methods defined by urllib2.Request class to interact with CookieJar class
    
    see http://docs.python.org/library/urllib2.html#urllib2.Request
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def get_origin_req_host(self):
        # Extract the hostname from the request URL
        return urlparse(self.request.url).hostname
```
In this corrected code, we import the 'urlparse' function from 'urllib.parse' and use it to extract the hostname from the request URL directly within the 'get_origin_req_host' function. This should ensure that the hostname is properly obtained and the bug is fixed.
