1. The test case is checking the `get_origin_req_host` method of the `WrappedRequest` class. It is expected to return the origin request host, but it is failing with an AttributeError indicating that the `origin_req_host` attribute is not found.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the return statement. The method is supposed to return the `origin_req_host` attribute, but it is currently returning the result of a `urlparse_cached` function, which is not the correct behavior.

3. The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `get_origin_req_host` method is not correctly implemented to return the `origin_req_host` attribute.

4. To fix the bug, we need to modify the `get_origin_req_host` method to return the `origin_req_host` attribute directly instead of invoking the `urlparse_cached` function.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class WrappedRequest(object):
    """
    Wraps a scrapy Request class with methods defined by urllib2.Request class to interact with CookieJar class
    
    see http://docs.python.org/library/urllib2.html#urllib2.Request
    """
    
    # ... omitted code ...
    
    # The corrected get_origin_req_host function
    def get_origin_req_host(self):
        return self.origin_req_host
```
