Potential Error Location:
The error is likely occurring at the line `if cookie.secure and request.type != "https":` in the add_cookie_header method in the cookies.py file of the Scrapy library.

Reasons Behind the Bug:
The error message "AttributeError: 'WrappedRequest' object has no attribute 'type'" indicates that the request object being passed to the add_cookie_header method is a 'WrappedRequest' instance, which does not have a 'type' attribute. This causes the AttributeError when the method attempts to access the 'type' attribute.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix this bug, it is necessary to ensure that the request object passed to the add_cookie_header method has the required 'type' attribute. One possible approach is to modify the get_origin_req_host method in the WrappedRequest class to return the original request object instead of using a method like urlparse_cached.

Corrected Code:

```python
from scrapy.http import Request

class WrappedRequest(object):
    """
    Wraps a scrapy Request class with methods defined by urllib2.Request class to interact with CookieJar class
    
    see http://docs.python.org/library/urllib2.html#urllib2.Request
    """
    def __init__(self, request):
        self.request = request

    def get_origin_req_host(self):
        return self.request.headers.get('Host', None)
```
