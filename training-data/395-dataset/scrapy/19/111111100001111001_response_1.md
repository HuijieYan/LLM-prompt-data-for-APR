Potential error location: The error may be occurring in the `urlparse_cached` function call inside the `get_origin_req_host` method.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The `urlparse_cached` function is likely not importing properly, which is causing the `AttributeError` message.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Check if the `urlparse_cached` function is properly imported or defined within the scope of the `get_origin_req_host` method.
- Ensure that the correct module is being imported for `urlparse_cached`, as it may be conflicting with another module.

Corrected code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_19/scrapy/http/cookies.py

# import the required module
from scrapy.utils.url import urlparse_cached

# class declaration containing the corrected function
class WrappedRequest(object):
    """
    Wraps a scrapy Request class with methods defined by urllib2.Request class to interact with CookieJar class

    see http://docs.python.org/library/urllib2.html#urllib2.Request
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # the corrected function
    def get_origin_req_host(self):
        return urlparse_cached(self.request).hostname
```
