The error message indicates that the 'WrappedRequest' object does not have an attribute 'origin_req_host', which is being checked in the test function 'test_get_origin_req_host'.

The potential error in the 'get_origin_req_host' function is that it is trying to access an attribute 'origin_req_host' that has not been defined in the class.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the 'get_origin_req_host' function is trying to access an attribute that does not exist in the 'WrappedRequest' class.

To fix the bug, we need to define the 'origin_req_host' attribute in the 'WrappedRequest' class.

Here's the corrected code for the 'get_origin_req_host' function:

```python
class WrappedRequest(object):
    """
    Wraps a scrapy Request class with methods defined by urllib2.Request class to interact with CookieJar class
    
    see http://docs.python.org/library/urllib2.html#urllib2.Request
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def get_origin_req_host(self):
        return urlparse_cached(self.request).hostname

    @property
    def origin_req_host(self):
        return urlparse_cached(self.request).hostname
```
