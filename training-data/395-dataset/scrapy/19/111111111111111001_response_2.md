The error occurs because the attribute 'origin_req_host' is being accessed in the test function, but it is not defined in the original 'get_origin_req_host' function. 

The bug in the function 'get_origin_req_host' is that it is trying to access 'self.request' directly without considering it as a Request object. Additionally, 'urlparse_cached' function is not defined. To fix this bug, the 'urlparse' function from the 'urllib.parse' module should be used to correctly extract the hostname from the request URL.

Here is the corrected code for the 'get_origin_req_host' function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse

# class declaration containing the buggy function
class WrappedRequest(object):
    """
    Wraps a scrapy Request class with methods defined by urllib2.Request class to interact with CookieJar class
    
    see http://docs.python.org/library/urllib2.html#urllib2.Request
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def get_origin_req_host(self):
        return urlparse(self.request.url).hostname
```

By using 'urlparse' from the 'urllib.parse' module, the corrected function will extract the hostname from the request URL and return it, fixing the bug in the original function.
