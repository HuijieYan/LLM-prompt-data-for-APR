Potential Error Location:
The error is likely occurring within the `get_origin_req_host` method of the `WrappedRequest` class.

Reasons for the Bug:
The AttributeError is raised because the `WrappedRequest` object does not have an attribute called `origin_req_host`.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check the source code for the `WrappedRequest` class and the `get_origin_req_host` method to see if `origin_req_host` is being incorrectly referenced.
2. If `origin_req_host` is intended to be part of the `WrappedRequest` class, ensure that it is correctly initialized or defined.

Corrected Code:
```python
def get_origin_req_host(self):
    return urlparse_cached(self.request).hostname
```

Based on the provided information, without access to the source code for the `WrappedRequest` class and the `urlparse_cached` method, it's challenging to provide a complete and accurate solution. The correction assumes that the method is intended to return the hostname from the cached URL parse. Further investigation into the `WrappedRequest` class and its attributes may be necessary to fully resolve the issue.
