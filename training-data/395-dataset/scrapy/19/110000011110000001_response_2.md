Potential Error Location:
The `get_origin_req_host` function is attempting to access a `hostname` attribute from the result of `urlparse_cached(self.request)`, but there is no `hostname` attribute and the error message refers to an `origin_req_host` attribute that is not being found.

Reasons for the Bug:
The `get_origin_req_host` function either has the wrong attribute or method being called, or the `origin_req_host` attribute is supposed to be accessed directly rather than through the `get_origin_req_host` method.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the `get_origin_req_host` function to access the correct attribute or method to obtain the `origin_req_host` value directly.
2. Alternatively, update the `get_origin_req_host` function to return the `origin_req_host` attribute directly, assuming it's available in the `self.request` object.
3. If `origin_req_host` is supposed to be accessed through the `get_origin_req_host` method, ensure that `origin_req_host` is properly set within the `self.wrapped` object.

Corrected Code:

```python
def get_origin_req_host(self):
    return self.request.origin_req_host
```
In this corrected code, we assume that the `origin_req_host` attribute is accessible directly from the `self.request` object. If it's not directly accessible, the `get_origin_req_host` function should call the necessary method or access the correct attribute to obtain the `origin_req_host` value.
