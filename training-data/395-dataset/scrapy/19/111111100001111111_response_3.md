The error occurred in the function `get_origin_req_host` of the class `WrappedRequest`. The error message "AttributeError: 'WrappedRequest' object has no attribute 'type'" suggests that the attribute `type` is missing in the `WrappedRequest` class.

Upon reviewing the code, it seems that the `WrappedRequest` class does not have an attribute named `type`. The issue may be related to compatibility problems between Python 3 and Python 2, as suggested in the issue description. The `type` attribute is likely being used internally in the Scrapy library for differentiating between HTTP and HTTPS requests.

To fix this issue, we can modify the `get_origin_req_host` function to use an alternative method for checking the request type, such as checking the scheme of the URL.

```python
# class declaration containing the fixed function
class WrappedRequest(object):
    """
    Wraps a scrapy Request class with methods defined by urllib2.Request class to interact with CookieJar class

    see http://docs.python.org/library/urllib2.html#urllib2.Request
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def get_origin_req_host(self):
        url = urlparse_cached(self.request)
        if url.scheme in ('http', 'https'):
            return url.hostname
        return None
```

By using the `urlparse_cached` function to parse the request URL and then checking the `scheme` attribute of the parsed URL, we can ensure that the correct hostname is returned for both HTTP and HTTPS requests. This should resolve the attribute error and enable the successful execution of the spider.
