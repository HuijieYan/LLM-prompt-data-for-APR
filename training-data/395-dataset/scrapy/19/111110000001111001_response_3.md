Potential error location: The `get_origin_req_host` function is trying to access the `request` attribute directly from the `WrappedRequest` class, but it should be accessing it through the `self` parameter.

Reason for the bug: The `get_origin_req_host` function is trying to access the `request` attribute without referencing the correct class instance (self).

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Modify the `get_origin_req_host` function to access the `request` attribute through the `self` parameter, as it is an instance attribute.

Corrected code:
```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class WrappedRequest(object):
    """
    Wraps a scrapy Request class with methods defined by urllib2.Request class to interact with CookieJar class
    
    see http://docs.python.org/library/urllib2.html#urllib2.Request
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # the corrected function
    def get_origin_req_host(self):
        return urlparse_cached(self.request.url).hostname
```
