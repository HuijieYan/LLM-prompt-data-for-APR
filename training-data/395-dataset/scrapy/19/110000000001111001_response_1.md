# Corrected function

```python
from scrapy.http import Request

def get_origin_req_host(self):
    return urlparse_cached(self.request.url).hostname
```

The potential error in the original function is the incorrect use of `self.request` without the `.url` attribute to access the URL.

The bug occurred because the function attempted to access the hostname directly from the `self.request` object, which raised an AttributeError because the `self.request` object does not have a `hostname` attribute.

To fix the bug, the correct approach is to access the URL from `self.request` using the `.url` attribute, and then use `urlparse_cached` to extract the hostname.

The corrected code handles this by using `self.request.url` to access the URL and then using `urlparse_cached` to extract the hostname.
