The error message indicates that the 'WrappedRequest' object does not have an attribute 'origin_req_host', which is being checked in the test function.

The potential error location within the 'get_origin_req_host' function is the use of 'urlparse_cached' as it is not defined or imported.

The bug occurred because the 'urlparse_cached' function is not a built-in Python function and is not defined or imported within the provided code. As a result, calling 'urlparse_cached' will throw an AttributeError, which is exactly what is happening in this case.

To fix the bug, we can import the urlparse function from the urllib.parse module and use it to parse the request URL.

Here's the corrected code for the 'get_origin_req_host' function:

```python
# Corrected function
from urllib.parse import urlparse

def get_origin_req_host(self):
    return urlparse(self.request.url).hostname
```

With this modification, the 'urlparse' function from the 'urllib.parse' module is used to parse the request URL and retrieve the hostname, which should resolve the issue.
