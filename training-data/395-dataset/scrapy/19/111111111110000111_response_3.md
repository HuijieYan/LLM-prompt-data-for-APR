The error message indicates that the 'WrappedRequest' object has no attribute 'origin_req_host', which is expected to exist according to the test function.

The potential error location within the 'get_origin_req_host' function is the 'self.request' attribute, which seems to be missing. This is causing the 'urlparse_cached' function to fail and, as a result, the 'host' attribute to be non-existent.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the 'self.request' attribute is missing, and there is no direct attribute retrieval for 'origin_req_host' in the 'WrappedRequest' class.

To fix the bug, add the 'request' attribute to the 'WrappedRequest' class and retrieve the 'origin_req_host' attribute directly.

Here is the corrected code for the 'get_origin_req_host' function:

```python
def get_origin_req_host(self):
    return self.request.origin_req_host
```
