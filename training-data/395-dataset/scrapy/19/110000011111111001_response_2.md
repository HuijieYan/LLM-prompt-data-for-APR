The error occurs because the `get_origin_req_host` method is trying to access the `origin_req_host` attribute from the `WrappedRequest` object, but this attribute does not exist in the `WrappedRequest` class.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `get_origin_req_host` method to return the origin request host from the `self.request` object instead of trying to access a non-existent attribute from the `WrappedRequest` object.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_origin_req_host` method:

```python
def get_origin_req_host(self):
    return urlparse_cached(self.request.url).hostname
```

By using `self.request.url` instead of `self.request`, we can extract the hostname from the request URL and return it as the origin request host. This should fix the bug and make the test case pass.
