The error message indicates that the 'WrappedRequest' object does not have the attribute 'origin_req_host', which is being accessed in the test function `test_get_origin_req_host`. This suggests that the `get_origin_req_host` function is not setting the 'origin_req_host' attribute as expected.

The potential error location within the `get_origin_req_host` function is the `return urlparse_cached(self.request).hostname` line. It seems that this line should set the 'origin_req_host' attribute, but it is not doing so.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the 'origin_req_host' attribute is not being set in the `get_origin_req_host` function, causing it to be missing when it is accessed in the test function.

To fix the bug, we need to set the 'origin_req_host' attribute in the `get_origin_req_host` function. We can do this by modifying the function to set the 'origin_req_host' and then return its value.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_origin_req_host` function:

```python
def get_origin_req_host(self):
    self.origin_req_host = urlparse_cached(self.request).hostname
    return self.origin_req_host
```

By setting the 'origin_req_host' attribute before returning its value, the bug should be fixed and the test should pass without any errors.
