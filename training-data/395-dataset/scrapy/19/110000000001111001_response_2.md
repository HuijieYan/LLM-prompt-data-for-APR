The potential error in the `get_origin_req_host` function is the use of `urlparse_cached` without any reference to where it is coming from. It seems like `urlparse_cached` is a method or function that is being used without proper import.

The `urlparse_cached` function is not a built-in function in Python, and it seems like it is intended to parse the URL from the request. However, the correct method to achieve this in the case of Scrapy `Request` objects is to use the `url` attribute of the request object.

To fix the buggy function, we can access the URL directly from the `self.request` object and then retrieve the hostname using the `urlparse` method from the `urllib.parse` module.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
from urllib.parse import urlparse

def get_origin_req_host(self):
    return urlparse(self.request.url).hostname
``` 

This change directly accesses the URL from the request object using `self.request.url` and then parses the hostname using the `urlparse` method. This should resolve the issue and return the expected output.
