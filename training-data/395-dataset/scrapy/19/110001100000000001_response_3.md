Potential error location: The function `urlparse_cached` is being called with `self.request` as the argument, but it is not defined within the given code snippet.

Reason for the bug: The `urlparse_cached` function is not defined in the provided code, and it is unclear how the `self.request` object is related to the URL parsing.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define the `urlparse_cached` function within the same file or import it from a suitable library if it's a custom function.
2. Ensure that `self.request` or its related object contains the necessary information for URL parsing, such as the URL itself.
3. Use a different method for extracting the origin request host, such as directly accessing the host attribute of the URL if available.

Corrected code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_19/scrapy/http/cookies.py

from urllib.parse import urlparse

def get_origin_req_host(self):
    return urlparse(self.request.url).hostname
```
In the corrected code, the `urlparse` function from the `urllib.parse` library is used to extract the hostname from the request's URL. This assumes that the `self.request` object has a `url` attribute containing the URL. If the object structure differs, it may require adjustment to accurately parse the origin request host.
