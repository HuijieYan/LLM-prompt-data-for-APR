Potential Error: 
The error occurs when the `_root` argument is being used and warnings are being issued. It seems that when the `root` argument is not provided, it should default to the `_root` argument, but the current implementation does not handle this case properly.

Reason for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the code does not properly handle the case when the `root` argument is not provided and should default to the `_root` argument.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:
We can fix the bug by checking if the `root` argument is provided. If it is not provided, then we can default it to the value of the `_root` argument.
We should also remove the warning for the deprecated `_root` argument.

Corrected Code:
```python
def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
    st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

    if _root is not None:
        if root is None:
            root = _root

    if text is not None:
        response = _response_from_text(text, st)

    if response is not None:
        text = response.text
        kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

    self.response = response
    super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```
