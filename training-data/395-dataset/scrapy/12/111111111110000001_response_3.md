The error message indicates that the ValueError was not raised when calling the Selector function with both the TextResponse and text arguments. This suggests that the buggy __init__ function in the Selector class is not handling the input arguments correctly.

The potential error location is the part of the code where it is checking for the presence of both response and text arguments. This is likely where the ValueError should be raised if both are provided.

The bug occurred because the code is not properly checking for the presence of both response and text arguments, and raising a ValueError if both are provided. It is also not handling the _root argument deprecation properly.

To fix the bug, the code should check for the presence of both response and text arguments and raise a ValueError if both are provided. It should also handle the _root argument deprecation warning properly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
    if response is not None and text is not None:
        raise ValueError('Received both response and text')

    st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

    # Handle _root argument deprecation
    if _root is not None:
        warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                      ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
        if root is None:
            root = _root
        else:
            warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

    if text is not None:
        response = _response_from_text(text, st)

    if response is not None:
        text = response.text
        kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

    self.response = response
    super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```
