The potential error in the provided code is that the `__init__` method is being defined twice in the `Selector` class. This will cause the second definition to override the first one, resulting in the first `__init__` method being ignored.

To fix this bug, the second definition of the `__init__` method should be removed, and the code should be rearranged so that the intended logic is retained. Additionally, the deprecated warning handling should be updated to use the `type` argument instead of the `_root` argument where necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the `Selector` class:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class Selector(_ParselSelector, object_ref):
    # ... omitted code ...
    
    # signature of the corrected relative function in this class
    def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
        st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

        if _root is not None:
            warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                          ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
            if root is None:
                root = _root
            else:
                warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

        if text is not None:
            response = _response_from_text(text, st)

        if response is not None:
            text = response.text
            kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

        self.response = response
        super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```
This code retains the intended functionality and removes the duplicate definition of the `__init__` method, effectively fixing the bug.
