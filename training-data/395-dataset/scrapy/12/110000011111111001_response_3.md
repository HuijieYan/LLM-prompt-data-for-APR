The error message indicates that the ValueError is not being raised when the Selector function is called with both a TextResponse and text arguments.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional logic for handling the response and text arguments. It seems that the function is not properly handling the case where both response and text are provided.

The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle the case where both response and text arguments are provided. It seems that the function is trying to set the response and text variables simultaneously, leading to the ValueError not being raised as expected.

To fix the bug, we can modify the conditional logic to properly handle the case where both response and text arguments are provided. We can also improve the error handling to ensure that the ValueError is raised when appropriate.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
    if response is not None and text is not None:
        raise ValueError('received both response and text')

    st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

    if _root is not None:
        warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                      ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
        if root is None:
            root = _root
        else:
            warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

    if text is not None:
        response = _response_from_text(text, st)

    if response is not None:
        text = response.text
        kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

    self.response = response
    super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```

With this corrected code, the function will properly handle the case where both response and text arguments are provided and raise a ValueError as expected.
