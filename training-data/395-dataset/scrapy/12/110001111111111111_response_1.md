The error message indicates that the test case is not raising the expected `ValueError` when creating a `Selector` object with both `response` and `text` arguments.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `__init__` method, specifically in the logic that handles the `response` and `text` arguments.

The bug occurs because the `__init__` method of the `Selector` class is not properly handling the case when both `response` and `text` arguments are provided. The current implementation does not raise a `ValueError` when both `response` and `text` are given, which contradicts the expected behavior indicated in the test case.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `__init__` method to raise a `ValueError` when both `response` and `text` arguments are provided.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `Selector` class:

```python
def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
    if response is not None and text is not None:
        raise ValueError("Received both response and text. Please provide either response or text, not both.")
    
    st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

    if _root is not None:
        warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                      ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
        if root is None:
            root = _root
        else:
            warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

    if text is not None:
        response = _response_from_text(text, st)

    if response is not None:
        text = response.text
        kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

    self.response = response
    super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```
