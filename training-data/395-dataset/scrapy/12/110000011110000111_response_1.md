The error seems to be related to the `Selector` function not properly handling the case when both `response` and `text` arguments are provided.

The issue seems to be with the `__init__` function of the `Selector` class. The function is not handling the case when both `response` and `text` arguments are provided, causing the ValueError not to be raised as expected in the test case.

The reason behind the bug is that the function does not have proper conditional checks to handle the case when both `response` and `text` arguments are provided. This results in the `ValueError` not being raised as expected, leading to the test failure.

To fix the bug, we need to add a conditional check at the beginning of the `__init__` function to handle the case when both `response` and `text` arguments are provided. We can raise a `ValueError` in this case to indicate that only one of them should be provided.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
    if response is not None and text is not None:
        raise ValueError("Only one of 'response' and 'text' should be provided")

    st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

    if _root is not None:
        warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                      ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
        if root is None:
            root = _root
        else:
            warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

    if text is not None:
        response = _response_from_text(text, st)

    if response is not None:
        text = response.text
        kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

    self.response = response
    super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```

With this correction, the `__init__` function now checks for the case when both `response` and `text` arguments are provided and raises a `ValueError` accordingly. This should address the issue observed in the test case.
