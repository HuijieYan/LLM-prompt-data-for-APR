Potential error location: 
The error in the buggy function is that it is trying to call undefined functions _st and _response_from_text, which are not defined within the given code snippet.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurred because the functions _st and _response_from_text are not defined within the provided code snippet, causing the code to raise a NameError when trying to use them.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define the missing functions _st and _response_from_text within the code.
2. Or remove the calls to these functions if they are not necessary for the functionality of the __init__ method.

Corrected code:

```python
class Selector:
    def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
        if response is not None:
            st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)
            if _root is not None:
                warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                              ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
                if root is None:
                    root = _root
                else:
                    warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")
        elif text is not None:
            response = _response_from_text(text, st)
    
        if response is not None:
            text = response.text
            kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)
    
        self.response = response
        super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```
