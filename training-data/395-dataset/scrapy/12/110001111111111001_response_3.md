The test function test_selector_bad_args is trying to create a Selector object with both the "response" and "text" arguments provided. This should raise a ValueError according to the error message, but currently, it is not raising the ValueError as expected.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the "__init__" method.

The bug occurs because the code does not check for both "response" and "text" arguments being provided at the same time. The current logic of the "__init__" method does not handle this scenario, which leads to the ValueError not being raised as expected.

To fix the bug, the "__init__" method should be updated to check if both "response" and "text" arguments are provided simultaneously, and in that case, raise a ValueError.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# corrected function
def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
    if response is not None and text is not None:
        raise ValueError("received both response and text")

    st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

    if _root is not None:
        warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                      ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
        if root is None:
            root = _root
        else:
            warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

    if text is not None:
        response = _response_from_text(text, st)

    if response is not None:
        text = response.text
        kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

    self.response = response
    super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```

With this corrected code, the "__init__" method now checks for both "response" and "text" arguments being provided at the same time, and raises a ValueError if that's the case.
