The potential error location within the problematic function is the initialization of the `Selector` class. 

The bug occurs because the `Selector` class has two `__init__` methods with the same signature, which is not allowed in Python. This causes confusion and makes it unclear which `__init__` method is being called.

To fix the bug, the duplicate `__init__` method needs to be removed and the logic from the buggy `__init__` method should be merged into the remaining `__init__` method.

Below is the corrected code for the `Selector` class with the merged logic:

```python
# corrected code for the problematic function

class Selector(_ParselSelector, object_ref):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
        st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)
        
        if _root is not None:
            warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                          ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
            if root is None:
                root = _root
            else:
                warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

        if text is not None:
            response = _response_from_text(text, st)

        if response is not None:
            text = response.text
            kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

        self.response = response
        super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```
