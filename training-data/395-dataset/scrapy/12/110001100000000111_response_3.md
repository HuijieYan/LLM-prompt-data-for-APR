Potential error location:
The error could be related to the usage of the deprecated `_root` argument and the logic for handling it.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the code is checking for the presence of `_root` and then handling it as a deprecated argument. However, the logic is not properly handling the case when both `root` and `_root` are provided.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the case when both `root` and `_root` are provided, and use `root` instead of `_root` if both are provided.

Corrected code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_12/scrapy/selector/unified.py

class Selector:
    # ... other functions ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
        st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)
        
        if _root is not None:
            warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                          ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
            if root is None:
                root = _root
            else:
                warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")
        
        if text is not None:
            response = _response_from_text(text, st)
            kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)
            self.response = response
            super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, _root=_root, **kwargs)
```
