Potential error location: The bug is likely to be in the `__init__` method where it initializes the class.

Reasons behind the bug: 
1. The `st` variable is being assigned the result of the `_st` function, but the `_st` function is not defined in the provided code.
2. It seems that the `_response_from_text` function is also being used without being defined in the provided code.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Define the `_st` and `_response_from_text` functions or import them from their respective modules if they are part of another module.
2. Ensure that the `root` variable is properly handling the deprecated `_root` argument.
3. Check if the `super` call at the end of the `__init__` method is appropriate for the class being inherited.

Corrected code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_12/scrapy/selector/unified.py

# Relative function's signature in this file
def _st(response, st):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# Relative function's signature in this file
def _response_from_text(text, st):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

            st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)
            kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)
        elif text:
            st = type or self._default_type
        else:
            st = 'html'

        if text is not None:
