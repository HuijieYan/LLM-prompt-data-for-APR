Potential Error Location:
The error is likely within the __init__ function of the Selector class. The error message suggests that the ValueError is not being raised when both response and text are received as arguments.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug might be occurring because the if conditions for text and response are not properly handling the case when both text and response are provided as arguments.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
We can fix the bug by adding a check to raise a ValueError if both response and text are provided as arguments.

Corrected Code:
```python
def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
    st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

    if _root is not None:
        warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead", ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
        if root is None:
            root = _root
        else:
            warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

    if text is not None and response is not None:
        raise ValueError("received both response and text")

    if text is not None:
        response = _response_from_text(text, st)

    if response is not None:
        text = response.text
        kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

    self.response = response
    super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```
