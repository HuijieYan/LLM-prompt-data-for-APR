The error message indicates that the ValueError was not raised when the Selector method was called with both the response and text arguments.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the check for both response and text arguments. The function should raise a ValueError if both are provided.

The bug occurred because the check for both response and text arguments is missing, and the function did not raise a ValueError when both were provided.

To fix the bug, we can add a check at the beginning of the function to raise a ValueError if both response and text arguments are provided.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
    if response is not None and text is not None:
        raise ValueError("Received both response and text, only one is allowed")

    st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

    if _root is not None:
        warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                      ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
        if root is None:
            root = _root
        else:
            warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

    if text is not None:
        response = _response_from_text(text, st)

    if response is not None:
        text = response.text
        kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

    self.response = response
    super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```
