The test case 'test_selector_bad_args' is trying to raise a ValueError when both 'response' and 'text' are provided to the Selector function, but it is not currently raising the ValueError as expected.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for handling 'response' and 'text' parameters. It seems that the function is not properly handling the case when both 'response' and 'text' are provided.

The bug occurs because the function does not raise a ValueError when both 'response' and 'text' are provided. Instead, it attempts to process both, which leads to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, we can add a check at the beginning of the function to ensure that only one of 'response' or 'text' is provided. If both are provided, a ValueError should be raised.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
    if response is not None and text is not None:
        raise ValueError('received both response and text')

    st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

    if _root is not None:
        warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                      ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
        if root is None:
            root = _root
        else:
            warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

    if text is not None:
        response = _response_from_text(text, st)

    if response is not None:
        text = response.text
        kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

    self.response = response
    super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
``` 

With this correction, the function will raise a ValueError if both 'response' and 'text' are provided, as expected in the test case.
