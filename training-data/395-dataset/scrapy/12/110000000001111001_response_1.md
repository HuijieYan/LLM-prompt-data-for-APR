Potential Error Location:
The potential error location in the given function is the incorrect use of the `super()` function. The `super()` function is not being called correctly.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug is occurring because the `super()` function is not being used properly to initialize the parent class.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
The bug can be fixed by using the `super()` function correctly to initialize the parent class Selector.

Corrected code:

```python
# Corrected function
def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
    st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

    if _root is not None:
        warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                      ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
        if root is None:
            root = _root
        else:
            warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

    if text is not None:
        response = _response_from_text(text, st)

    if response is not None:
        text = response.text
        kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

    self.response = response
    super().__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```
In the corrected code, the `super()` function is called without passing the class and the instance explicitly. This ensures that the `Selector` class is properly initialized by calling the `__init__` method of the parent class.
