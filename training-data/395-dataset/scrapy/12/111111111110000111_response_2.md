The error message from the test function indicates that the `ValueError` is not being raised as expected when both `response` and `text` arguments are provided to the `Selector` function.

Upon analyzing the code, it appears that the `__init__` function of the `Selector` class is being defined twice in the same class, causing confusion.

Additionally, in the buggy code, the conditional logic for handling `response` and `text` arguments is flawed. If both `response` and `text` are provided, it should raise a `ValueError` because it cannot handle both at the same time.

The correction would involve removing the duplicate `__init__` function, including proper handling of the `response` and `text` arguments.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
    st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

    if response is not None and text is not None:
        raise ValueError("Received both response and text, please provide only one")

    if _root is not None:
        warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                      ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
        if root is None:
            root = _root
        else:
            warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

    if text is not None:
        response = _response_from_text(text, st)

    if response is not None:
        text = response.text
        kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

    self.response = response
    super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```

With this correction, the `__init__` function now properly handles the `response` and `text` arguments and raises a `ValueError` if both are provided simultaneously.
