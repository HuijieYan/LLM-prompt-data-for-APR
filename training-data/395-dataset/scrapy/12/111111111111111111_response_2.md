The error is likely happening in the `Selector` class's `__init__` method, where it seems that it is not properly handling the case when both `response` and `text` are provided.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic handling the `text` and `response` variables. It fails to properly handle the situation when both `text` and `response` are provided.

The bug occurs because the `__init__` method does not handle the case when both `response` and `text` are provided. The logic for setting the `response` and `text` variables seems to be conflicting and does not account for both being provided.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the logic in the `__init__` method to handle the case when both `response` and `text` are provided. It could prioritize one over the other, or raise an error if both are provided.

Here's the corrected code for the `Selector` class's `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
    st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

    if _root is not None:
        warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                      ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
        if root is None:
            root = _root
        else:
            warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

    if response is not None and text is not None:  # Handle case when both response and text are provided
        raise ValueError("Received both response and text. Please provide only one.")

    if text is not None:
        response = _response_from_text(text, st)

    if response is not None:
        text = response.text
        kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

    self.response = response
    super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```

The modified logic now checks for the case when both `response` and `text` are provided and raises a `ValueError` to alert the user to provide only one of them.
