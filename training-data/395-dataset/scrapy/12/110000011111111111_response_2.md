Potential error location:
The error is likely occurring in the initialization of the Selector object, where the function is not properly handling the cases when both response and text arguments are provided.

Reason behind the bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle the case when both response and text arguments are provided. It seems that the function is not checking for this condition and raising the appropriate ValueError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
One possible approach would be to add a check at the beginning of the function to verify if both response and text are provided. If that's the case, the function should raise a ValueError with an appropriate error message.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from scrapy.http import TextResponse
from scrapy.selector import Selector

# corrected function
def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
    if response is not None and text is not None:
        raise ValueError('Received both response and text. Please provide only one.')

    st = self._st(response, type or self._default_type)

    if _root is not None:
        warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                      ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
        if root is None:
            root = _root
        else:
            warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

    if text is not None:
        response = _response_from_text(text, st)

    if response is not None:
        text = response.text
        kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

    self.response = response
    super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```
