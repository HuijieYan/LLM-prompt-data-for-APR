Potential error location: 
The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `__init__` method. It seems that the `response` and `text` parameters are not handled correctly, leading to the `ValueError` not being raised as expected in the test case.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the `response` and `text` parameters are not properly handled in the `__init__` method. The `response` is overridden by the `text` parameter, which causes the ValueError not to be raised as expected in the test case.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Check if both `response` and `text` parameters are provided, and raise a ValueError if that's the case.
2. Ensure that the `response` parameter is not overridden by the `text` parameter.
3. Handle the deprecation warnings for the `_root` and `root` parameters properly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
    if response is not None and text is not None:
        raise ValueError("Received both response and text")

    st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

    if _root is not None:
        warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                      ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
        if root is None:
            root = _root
        else:
            warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

    if response is not None:
        text = response.text
        kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

    self.response = response
    super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```
