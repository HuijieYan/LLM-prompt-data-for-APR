Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the `__init__` method of the `Selector` class. 

Reason for the bug: The bug seems to be related to handling `response` and `text` arguments. The error message indicates that a `ValueError` should be raised when both `response` and `text` are provided, but it is not being raised, suggesting that the conditional logic for handling these arguments is not working as intended.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: 
1. Adjust the conditional logic to properly handle the cases where both `response` and `text` are provided.
2. Modify the `__init__` method to ensure that it correctly handles the `response` and `text` arguments.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
    st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

    if response is not None and text is not None:
        raise ValueError("received both response and text")

    if _root is not None:
        warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                      ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
        if root is None:
            root = _root
        else:
            warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

    if text is not None:
        response = _response_from_text(text, st)

    if response is not None:
        text = response.text
        kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

    self.response = response
    super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```
