Potential error location: The error is likely occurring within the `__init__` method of the `Selector` class. It seems that the error is related to the way the `Selector` class is handling the `response` and `text` arguments.

Reasons for the bug: The bug is likely occurring because the `__init__` method of the `Selector` class is not handling the `response` and `text` arguments properly. The error message suggests that the `ValueError` is not being raised when both `response` and `text` are received.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if both `response` and `text` are being received. If both are provided, raise a `ValueError`.
2. Modify the validation process for the `response` and `text` arguments to ensure that only one of them is provided.

# Corrected code for the problematic function

```python
# Corrected __init__ method
def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
    if response is not None and text is not None:
        raise ValueError("Received both response and text")

    st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

    if _root is not None:
        warnings.warn(
            "Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
            ScrapyDeprecationWarning,
            stacklevel=2,
        )
        if root is None:
            root = _root
        else:
            warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

    if text is not None:
        response = _response_from_text(text, st)

    if response is not None:
        text = response.text
        kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

    self.response = response
    super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```
