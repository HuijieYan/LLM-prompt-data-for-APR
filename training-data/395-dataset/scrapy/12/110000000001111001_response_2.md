The potential error in the code is that the `__init__` method is not properly defined and the super constructor is not being called correctly.

The bug occurs because the `__init__` method is not properly initializing the class with the provided arguments. Additionally, the `super` constructor is not being called with the correct arguments.

To fix the bug, the `__init__` method should be defined with the correct parameters and the super constructor should be called with the appropriate arguments.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
    st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

    if _root is not None:
        warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                      ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
        if root is None:
            root = _root
        else:
            warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

    if text is not None:
        response = _response_from_text(text, st)

    if response is not None:
        text = response.text
        kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

    self.response = response
    super().__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```
