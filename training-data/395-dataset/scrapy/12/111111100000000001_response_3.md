The potential error in the code is that the `__init__` function is defined twice within the `Selector` class. This will cause an error because a class cannot have two functions with the same name.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `__init__` function is being redefined in the `Selector` class without any modification or overloading of its behavior.

To fix the bug, the duplicated `__init__` function within the `Selector` class needs to be removed and the code logic needs to be combined into a single `__init__` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` function within the `Selector` class:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class Selector(_ParselSelector, object_ref):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # corrected signature of the __init__ function
    def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
        st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

        if _root is not None:
            warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                          ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
            if root is None:
                root = _root
            else:
                warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

        if text is not None:
            response = _response_from_text(text, st)

        if response is not None:
            text = response.text
            kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

        self.response = response
        super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```
