Potential Error Location:
The error is related to the `Selector` function, specifically when it's called with both `TextResponse` and `text` arguments.

Reasons behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `Selector` function does not handle the case where both `response` and `text` arguments are provided. The function should only receive one of these arguments, not both.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, we need to modify the `Selector` function to handle the case where both `response` and `text` arguments are provided. One approach is to prioritize the `response` argument over the `text` argument if both are given. If `response` is provided, use it to extract the `text` and other necessary information. If `text` is provided, use it to create a `response` and then extract the `text`.

Additionally, we should consider handling warning messages related to deprecated arguments, such as `_root`.

Corrected Code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_12/scrapy/selector/unified.py

import warnings

# Other relative function's signatures are kept the same

class Selector:
    def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
        st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

        if _root is not None:
            warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead", ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
            if root is None:
                root = _root
            else:
                warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

        if response is not None:
            text = response.text
            kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)
        elif text is not None:
            # Create a temporary response from the provided text
            response = _response_from_text(text, st)
            kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

        self.response = response
        super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```
