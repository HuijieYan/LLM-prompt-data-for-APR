The error message from the test function indicates that a ValueError should have been raised when both a response and text are provided to the Selector, but it was not raised. This suggests that the buggy __init__ function is not correctly handling the case where both response and text are provided.

The potential error location within the __init__ function is the logic for handling the cases where both response and text are provided.

The bug occurs because the __init__ function does not check for the case where both response and text are provided. It only handles the cases where either response or text is provided.

To fix the bug, the __init__ function should explicitly check if both response and text are provided and raise a ValueError in that case.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
    if response is not None and text is not None:
        raise ValueError('received both response and text')

    st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

    if _root is not None:
        warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                      ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
        if root is None:
            root = _root
        else:
            warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

    if text is not None:
        response = _response_from_text(text, st)

    if response is not None:
        text = response.text
        kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

    self.response = response
    super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```
