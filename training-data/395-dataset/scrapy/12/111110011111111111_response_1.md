The error message from the test function indicates that the ValueError was not raised when it was expected. This suggests that the buggy function is not working as intended.

The potential error in the problematic function lies in the conditional checks for the 'response' and 'text' arguments. The function is not raising a ValueError when both 'response' and 'text' are provided, which is contrary to the expected behavior based on the test case.

The bug occurred because the conditional checks for 'response' and 'text' were not properly handling the case when both were provided. The function should raise a ValueError in this case, but it is not doing so.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional checks to explicitly raise a ValueError when both 'response' and 'text' are provided. Additionally, the initialization of 'st' with the _st function needs to be reviewed for correctness.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
    st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

    if response is not None and text is not None:
        raise ValueError("Received both response and text")

    if _root is not None:
        warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                      ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
        if root is None:
            root = _root
        else:
            warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

    if text is not None:
        response = _response_from_text(text, st)

    if response is not None:
        text = response.text
        kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

    self.response = response
    super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```

With these modifications, the function will now correctly raise a ValueError when both 'response' and 'text' are provided, resolving the bug.
