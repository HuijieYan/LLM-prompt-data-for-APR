The error message from the test function indicates that a `ValueError` is not being raised when it should be. This suggests that there is an issue with the `Selector` function not properly handling the case where both `response` and `text` arguments are provided.

The potential error location within the `Selector` function is the conditional checks for `response` and `text`.

The bug occurs because the function is not properly handling the case where both `response` and `text` arguments are provided. The function is not raising a `ValueError` when it should in this scenario.

To fix the bug, the function should raise a `ValueError` when both `response` and `text` arguments are provided, as this is not a valid combination of arguments for the function.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
    if response is not None and text is not None:
        raise ValueError("Received both response and text, only one should be provided")

    st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

    if _root is not None:
        warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                      ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
        if root is None:
            root = _root
        else:
            warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

    if text is not None:
        response = _response_from_text(text, st)

    if response is not None:
        text = response.text
        kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

    self.response = response
    super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
``` 

In the corrected code, an additional check has been added to raise a `ValueError` when both `response` and `text` arguments are provided.
