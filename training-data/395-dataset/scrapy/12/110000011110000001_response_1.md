Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the way the Selector class is being called in the test function. The error message indicates that a ValueError is not being raised, which suggests that the conditional logic within the __init__ method of the Selector class is not handling the input parameters correctly.

Reason for the bug: The bug may be occurring due to incorrect handling of the input parameters 'response' and 'text' within the __init__ method of the Selector class. The conditional logic seems to be flawed, leading to the ValueError not being raised as expected.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Add proper conditional checks to handle the input parameters 'response' and 'text' in a way that either one of them is accepted, not both.
2. Update the logic to correctly initialize the Selector class based on the provided input parameters.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import warnings
from scrapy.selector import Selector as ScrapySelector
from scrapy.http import TextResponse

class Selector(ScrapySelector):
    def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
        st = type or self._default_type

        if _root is not None:
            warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                          DeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
            if root is None:
                root = _root
            else:
                warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

        if response is not None and text is not None:
            raise ValueError('received both response and text')
        elif response is not None:
            text = response.text
            kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)
        elif text is not None:
            response = TextResponse(url='', body=text.encode('utf-8'))

        super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)

    def _default_type(self):
        return 'html'
```

This corrected code includes proper conditional checks to handle the input parameters 'response' and 'text' and raise a ValueError if both are provided. It also initializes the Selector class based on the provided input parameters.
