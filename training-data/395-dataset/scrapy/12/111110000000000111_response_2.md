The potential error in the provided code is that the `__init__` function is defined twice in the `Selector` class, which will cause conflicts and issues with inheritance.

The bug occurs because the `__init__` function is being redefined in the `Selector` class. This will lead to confusion when creating instances of the class and will not allow proper initialization of the class attributes.

To fix this bug, the duplicate `__init__` function should be removed from the class, and the code within the original `__init__` function should be retained.

Here's the corrected code for the `Selector` class with the duplicate `__init__` function removed:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class Selector(_ParselSelector, object_ref):
    # ... omitted code ...
    
    # signature of the original __init__ function in this class
    def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
        st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)
    
        if _root is not None:
            warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                          ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
            if root is None:
                root = _root
            else:
                warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")
    
        if text is not None:
            response = _response_from_text(text, st)
    
        if response is not None:
            text = response.text
            kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)
    
        self.response = response
        super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```

The duplicate `__init__` function has been removed, and the original `__init__` function has been preserved with the necessary code.
