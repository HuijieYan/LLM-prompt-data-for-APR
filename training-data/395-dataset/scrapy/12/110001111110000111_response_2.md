The error occurred because the Selector class is not handling the case where both response and text arguments are provided. This leads to the ValueError not being raised as expected in the test case.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the response and text arguments.

The bug occurred because the code does not properly handle the case where both response and text arguments are provided. The __init__ method should check for both response and text and raise a ValueError if both are provided.

To fix the bug, the code needs to check if both response and text are provided and raise a ValueError in that case. Additionally, the code should also update the call to the super() method to pass the response argument instead of text, if response is provided.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
    st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

    if response is not None and text is not None:
        raise ValueError("Received both response and text")

    if _root is not None:
        warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                      ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
        if root is None:
            root = _root
        else:
            warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

    if text is not None:
        response = _response_from_text(text, st)

    if response is not None:
        kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

    self.response = response
    super(Selector, self).__init__(response=response, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```

With these changes, the function will properly handle the case when both response and text are provided, and it will raise a ValueError in that case. Additionally, the super() call now passes the response argument instead of text, if response is provided.
