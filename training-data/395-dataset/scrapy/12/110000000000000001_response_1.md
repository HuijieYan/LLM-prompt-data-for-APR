Potential Error Location: 

The potential error in the code is in the `super(Selector, self).__init__(text=text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)` line. It seems to be attempting to call the `__init__` method of the parent class `Selector`, but the usage may be incorrect.

Reason for the Bug:

The error may be occurring because the usage of `super` in Python is incorrect. The `super()` function is used to call the parent class' methods, but it needs to be used in a specific way to work correctly.

Possible Approach for Fixing the Bug:

To fix the bug, we should use `super()` with the proper arguments. Also, the parameters of the `__init__` method should be checked to ensure they are correctly passed.

Corrected Code:

```python
# corrected init method
def __init__(self, response=None, text=None, type=None, root=None, _root=None, **kwargs):
    st = _st(response, type or self._default_type)

    if _root is not None:
        warnings.warn("Argument `_root` is deprecated, use `root` instead",
                      ScrapyDeprecationWarning, stacklevel=2)
        if root is None:
            root = _root
        else:
            warnings.warn("Ignoring deprecated `_root` argument, using provided `root`")

    if text is not None:
        response = _response_from_text(text, st)

    if response is not None:
        text = response.text
        kwargs.setdefault('base_url', response.url)

    self.response = response
    super().__init__(text, type=st, root=root, **kwargs)
```
