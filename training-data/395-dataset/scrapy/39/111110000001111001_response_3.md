The issue with the provided function is that it is comparing two method objects using the 'is' keyword, which checks for object identity. However, it should be using the '==' operator to compare if the methods are the same. 

The reason behind the bug is that the function 'start_requests' is comparing the method 'make_requests_from_url' of the instance with the method 'make_requests_from_url' of the class. If they are not the same, it raises a warning and then tries to yield the result of the instance method. But if they are the same, it yields a Request object with the URL.

To fix this issue, we need to compare the methods using the '==' operator to check if they are the same.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
class Spider(object_ref):
    """
    Base class for scrapy spiders. All spiders must inherit from this
    class.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def make_requests_from_url(self, url):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass



    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def start_requests(self):
        if self.make_requests_from_url != Spider.make_requests_from_url:
            warnings.warn(
                "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
                "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
                "Please override start_requests method instead."
            )
            for url in self.start_urls:
                yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
        else:
            for url in self.start_urls:
                yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```
