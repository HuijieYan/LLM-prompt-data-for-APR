The error originates from the `test_make_requests_from_url_deprecated` test function. The failing assertion `self.assertEqual(len(w), 0)` indicates that the warning is not being issued as expected.

The issue is caused by the fact that the `make_requests_from_url` method is not being overridden in the `MySpider4` class, which leads to the warning not being emitted as expected. Additionally, the code in the `start_requests` method is not correctly handling the deprecation warning and the method override check.

To address this issue, the `start_requests` method should be updated to correctly handle the deprecation warning and method override check. Instead of comparing the methods directly, a more accurate approach involves using the `getattr` function to check if the method is overridden.

Here's the corrected code for the `start_requests` method:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    make_requests_from_url = getattr(self, 'make_requests_from_url', None)
    if make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```

In this corrected version, the `getattr` function is used to check if the `make_requests_from_url` method is overridden in the current class. If it is, a deprecation warning is issued, and the method is used accordingly. Otherwise, the original functionality is maintained.
