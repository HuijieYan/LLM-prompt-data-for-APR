The bug in the `start_requests` method is that it checks if `self.make_requests_from_url` is not equal to `Spider.make_requests_from_url`, and if true, it yields requests using `self.make_requests_from_url(url)`. However, if the condition is not true, it yields a Request object using the `Request` class, but it doesn't use the overridden `make_requests_from_url` method of the spider.

The error message from the test function indicates that the number of warnings recorded is not as expected, which could mean that the `make_requests_from_url` method is not being properly overridden or used in the `start_requests` method.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `start_requests` method to properly handle the case where the `make_requests_from_url` method is overridden in the spider class.

Here's the corrected code for the `start_requests` method:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```

This updated code checks if the `make_requests_from_url` method of the spider is overridden. If it is, it uses that method to yield requests, and if not, it falls back to the default behavior using the `Request` class.

This change ensures that the overridden `make_requests_from_url` method is properly used when yielding requests in the `start_requests` method.
