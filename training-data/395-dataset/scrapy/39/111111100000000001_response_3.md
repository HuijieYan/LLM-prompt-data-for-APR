Potential error:
The error lies in the condition `if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url` within the `start_requests` method. 

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The `make_requests_from_url` method is being compared to the class method `Spider.make_requests_from_url` using `is not`. This comparison will always return `True`, as they are not the same object, leading to the warning being triggered every time `start_requests` is called.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
We can compare the methods using their names instead of comparing the objects directly.

Corrected code:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    if self.make_requests_from_url.__func__ is not Spider.make_requests_from_url:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```
