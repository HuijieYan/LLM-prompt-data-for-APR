Potential Error Location: The error in the code is located in the start_requests method of the Spider class. It is comparing the make_requests_from_url method with Spider.make_requests_from_url, which is incorrect. 

Reasons behind the Bug: The bug occurred because the code is incorrectly comparing the make_requests_from_url method with the Spider.make_requests_from_url method. This is causing the warning message to be displayed incorrectly.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: The comparison should be done with the instance method of make_requests_from_url, rather than comparing it directly with the class method Spider.make_requests_from_url. 

Corrected Code:
```python
def start_requests(self):
    if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```
