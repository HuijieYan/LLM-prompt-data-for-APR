The error in the provided code seems to be occurring because the `self.make_requests_from_url` check in the `start_requests` method is always evaluating to `False`. This is leading to the warning message being displayed in all cases, even when it's not necessary. The conditional check `if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url` is not comparing the method properly.

The reason for this bug is that the comparison `self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url` is not a correct way to compare methods. It is comparing the method objects themselves, not their functionality.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to compare the actual methods and their functionalities, rather than the method objects. We can achieve this by directly comparing the method implementations.

Here's the corrected code for the `start_requests` method:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    if self.make_requests_from_url.__func__ is not Spider.make_requests_from_url.__func__:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```

In this corrected code, I've used `__func__` attribute to compare the actual functions and their implementations. This will allow the comparison to be based on the actual functionality of the methods, rather than the method objects themselves.
