Potential error location: The comparison of `self.make_requests_from_url` with `Spider.make_requests_from_url` is incorrect.

Reason for the bug: The comparison should be between the actual method of the spider and the method of the base Spider class. Currently, it is comparing the method itself, resulting in incorrect comparison.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Modify the comparison to compare the actual methods instead of the method objects.

```python
# Corrected function
def start_requests(self):
    if self.make_requests_from_url.__func__ is not Spider.make_requests_from_url:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```
