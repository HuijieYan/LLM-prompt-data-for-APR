The error occurs because the if condition `if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url` is incorrect. The intention of this condition is to compare if the method has been overridden, but the comparison being used will always evaluate to `True` because it's comparing methods rather than checking if the method has been overridden in the subclass.

To fix this issue, we need to use the `is` operator to check if the method has been overridden. This can be achieved by comparing the actual method object with the method defined in the base class.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```

In the corrected code, we compare the `make_requests_from_url` method of the object with the `make_requests_from_url` method from the base class `Spider` using the `is` operator to check if it has been overridden. If it has been overridden, the warning will be issued; otherwise, the method will be called as usual.
