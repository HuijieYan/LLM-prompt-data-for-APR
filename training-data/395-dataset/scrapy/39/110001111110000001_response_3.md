The provided code contains a deprecated function `make_requests_from_url` that is being used in the `start_requests` method. The error message from the test function indicates that warnings are not being recorded as expected, and the assertion for the length of warnings is failing.

The potential error in the `start_requests` method is that it is checking the equality of the `make_requests_from_url` method with the `Spider.make_requests_from_url`, which is not the intended comparison.

The buggy function is generating an error because the conditional check `if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url` is not the correct way to compare methods/functions.

To fix the bug, we need to compare the actual method references by using `!=` and call the correct `start_requests` method if `make_requests_from_url` has been overridden.

Here is the corrected code for the `start_requests` method:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    if self.make_requests_from_url != Spider.make_requests_from_url:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```

With this correction, the method references are compared using `!=` and the `start_requests` method is called based on the comparison result.
