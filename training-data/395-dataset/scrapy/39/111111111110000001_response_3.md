The error is occurring in the `test_make_requests_from_url_deprecated` test. The test is expecting the number of warnings recorded to be 0, but it is actually getting 1.

The potential error location within the code is the comparison `if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url:`. This comparison is not checking the class instances, it's just comparing the functions themselves, which always evaluates to `True` in Python. This is causing the warning to be issued for all instances of the Spider class, even when they have overridden the `make_requests_from_url` method.

The reason behind the bug is that the comparison `self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url` is incorrect for comparing methods of instances to class methods. It doesn't consider instances where the method has been overridden.

To fix the bug, the check should be modified to compare the function for the current instance with the function from the Spider class. This can be achieved by using the `getattr` function to get the method for the current instance.

Here's the updated and corrected code for the `start_requests` method:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    if getattr(self.make_requests_from_url, '__func__', None) is not Spider.make_requests_from_url:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```
