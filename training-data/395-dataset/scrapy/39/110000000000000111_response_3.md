Potential error:
The conditional statement `if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url` seems to be incorrectly comparing the method with another method. It should be comparing the method with a function to check if it is overridden.

Reason behind the bug:
The comparison in the conditional statement is incorrect. It is not checking if the method is overridden, but rather if it is the same method as the one in Spider class.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
We should check if the method is overridden by comparing it with the method defined in the current class. If it is not overridden, then we should use the default behavior, otherwise, we should yield requests accordingly.

Corrected code:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    if self.make_requests_from_url.__func__ is not Spider.make_requests_from_url.__func__:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```
