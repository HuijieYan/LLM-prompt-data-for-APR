The error occurs in the test case `test_make_requests_from_url_deprecated` where it calls the `spider1.start_requests()` and asserts that the length of the warnings recorded is 0, which is not the case.

The issue with the current implementation of the `start_requests` method is that it checks if `self.make_requests_from_url` is not equal to `Spider.make_requests_from_url`, which is not the correct approach to check if the method has been overridden. It should check if the method has been overridden in the subclass.

The reason for the bug is that the condition `self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url` is always evaluating to `True` because it compares the functions rather than checking if the method has been overridden in the subclass.

To fix the bug, we should use the `getattr()` function to check if the method `make_requests_from_url` has been overridden in the subclass.

Here's the corrected code for the `start_requests` method:

```python
class Spider(object_ref):
    # ... omitted code ...
    
    def start_requests(self):
        if getattr(self.make_requests_from_url, '__func__', None) is not getattr(Spider.make_requests_from_url, '__func__', None):
            warnings.warn(
                "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
                "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
                "Please override start_requests method instead."
            )
            for url in self.start_urls:
                yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
        else:
            for url in self.start_urls:
                yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```

With this correction, the `start_requests` method correctly checks if `make_requests_from_url` has been overridden in the subclass and issues a warning if it has been.
