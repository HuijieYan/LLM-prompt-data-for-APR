The error is likely occurring in the `start_requests` function because the assertion `self.assertEqual(len(w), 0)` is failing, indicating that the warning is not being issued as expected.

The problem is that the condition `if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url` is likely never being met, so the warnings are not being issued, and the correct method is not being called.

The condition `if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url` should actually be checking if `self.make_requests_from_url` is not `Spider.make_requests_from_url`, and if that is the case, then it should issue a warning and call `self.make_requests_from_url(url)`.

The correct condition should be `if self.make_requests_from_url != Spider.make_requests_from_url`.

Here's the corrected code for the `start_requests` function:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    if self.make_requests_from_url != Spider.make_requests_from_url:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```
After making this change, the warnings should be issued as expected, and the correct method will be called for `self.make_requests_from_url`.
