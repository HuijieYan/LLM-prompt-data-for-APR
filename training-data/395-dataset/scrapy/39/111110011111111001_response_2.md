The error "1 != 0" in the test function `test_make_requests_from_url_deprecated` indicates that the number of warnings recorded is 1 instead of 0. This suggests that the warning is being issued when it shouldn't be. 

The buggy function `start_requests` in the `Spider` class is designed to issue a warning if the `make_requests_from_url` method is not overridden and then yield requests based on the start URLs. However, it seems that the condition `if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url` is not working as intended.

The buggy function is likely not detecting whether `make_requests_from_url` is overridden in a subclass correctly. This is causing the warning to be issued when it shouldn't be.

To fix the bug, the condition `if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url` needs to be modified to correctly check if `make_requests_from_url` is overridden in the current class using the `inspect` module.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import inspect

# class declaration containing the buggy function
class Spider(object_ref):
    """
    Base class for scrapy spiders. All spiders must inherit from this
    class.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def make_requests_from_url(self, url):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass



    # this is the corrected function
    def start_requests(self):
        if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url and \
            inspect.getmodule(self.make_requests_from_url) != Spider.make_requests_from_url.__module__:
            warnings.warn(
                "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
                "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
                "Please override start_requests method instead."
            )
            for url in self.start_urls:
                yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
        else:
            for url in self.start_urls:
                yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)

```

This corrected condition uses `inspect.getmodule` to check if `make_requests_from_url` is defined in a different module than `Spider.make_requests_from_url`. This more accurately determines if the method has been overridden in a subclass.
