The error message indicates that the assertion `self.assertEqual(len(w), 0)` failed. This means that the number of warnings caught during the test is not equal to 0, which is unexpected.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `start_requests` method. The warning is triggered if the `make_requests_from_url` function is not the same as `Spider.make_requests_from_url`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the comparison `if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url` is comparing the function objects instead of their results, which may not be what was intended. Additionally, the correct way to override this behavior in Scrapy is to use the `start_requests` method instead of `make_requests_from_url`.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to remove the comparison and warning, and simply use the overridden `make_requests_from_url` method in the `start_requests` method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    for url in self.start_urls:
        yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
```

By simply calling `make_requests_from_url` in the `start_requests` method, we utilize the overridden function in the spider class without needing to compare it with `Spider.make_requests_from_url`. This aligns with the current best practice for Scrapy spiders.
