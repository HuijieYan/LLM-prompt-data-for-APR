The issue seems to be with the comparison `if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url:` in the `start_requests` method of the Spider class. This comparison is incorrect and does not achieve the intended functionality. 

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the comparison `self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url` is supposed to compare the `make_requests_from_url` method of the instance with the method in the Spider class. However, this comparison doesn't work as intended because it only checks if they are the exact same method object, not if they perform the same functionality.

To fix this issue, it's best to replace the comparison with a check to see if the `make_requests_from_url` method is overridden in the instance class by comparing the method in the instance class with the method in the Spider class.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class Spider(object_ref):
    """
    Base class for scrapy spiders. All spiders must inherit from this
    class.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # corrected start_requests method
    def start_requests(self):
        if self.make_requests_from_url.__func__ is not Spider.make_requests_from_url:
            warnings.warn(
                "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
                "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
                "Please override start_requests method instead."
            )
            for url in self.start_urls:
                yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
        else:
            for url in self.start_urls:
                yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```

By using `self.make_requests_from_url.__func__ is not Spider.make_requests_from_url` as the condition, we can check if the `make_requests_from_url` method is overridden in the instance, and act accordingly. This should resolve the issue and make the function work as intended.
