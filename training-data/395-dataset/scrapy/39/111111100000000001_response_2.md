Potential error location: The if condition `if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url` is intended to check if the `make_requests_from_url` method has been overridden in a subclass. However, it is incorrectly comparing the method references instead of checking if the method has been overridden.

Reasons behind the bug: The buggy function incorrectly compares method references, which can lead to incorrect behavior and may not accurately determine if the `make_requests_from_url` method has been overridden.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Use the `isinstance` function to check if the `make_requests_from_url` method has been overridden in the subclass.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    if self.make_requests_from_url.__func__ is not Spider.make_requests_from_url:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```
