The error occurs when the function `test_make_requests_from_url_deprecated` is running, and it fails at the assertion `self.assertEqual(len(w), 0)`. This indicates that the function `start_requests` has a bug and is not working as expected.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition `if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url`. The purpose of this condition is to check if the spider has overridden the `make_requests_from_url` method. However, the use of `is not` is not appropriate for comparing functions/methods for equality.

The bug occurs because the comparison `self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url` does not correctly check if the `make_requests_from_url` method has been overridden by the spider class. This comparison compares the memory addresses of the functions, not their actual content.

To fix the bug, the condition should be changed to `if self.make_requests_from_url != Spider.make_requests_from_url`. This change will compare the functions based on their content, not their memory addresses.

Here's the corrected code for the `start_requests` method:

```python
import warnings

class Spider:
    make_requests_from_url = None

    def start_requests(self):
        if self.make_requests_from_url != Spider.make_requests_from_url:
            warnings.warn(
                "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
                "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
                "Please override start_requests method instead."
            )
            for url in self.start_urls:
                yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
        else:
            for url in self.start_urls:
                yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```

With this correction, the comparison in the `start_requests` method will accurately determine if the `make_requests_from_url` method has been overridden.
