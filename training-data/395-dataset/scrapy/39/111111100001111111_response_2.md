The bug occurs in the `start_requests()` method of the `Spider` class. The condition `if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url:` is checking if the method `make_requests_from_url` is overridden in the current spider class. If not, it emits a warning message and yields a request using `Request(url, dont_filter=True)`.

The problem with the current implementation is that it's not checking whether the method is overridden in the class. Instead, it's comparing the method with `Spider.make_requests_from_url`, which will always be true since it's comparing the method with itself.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the method is overridden in the current class. We can do this by comparing it with the original method from the base class.

Here's the corrected code for the `start_requests()` method:

```python
from scrapy import Request
import warnings

class Spider(object_ref):
    """
    Base class for scrapy spiders. All spiders must inherit from this
    class.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # this is the corrected function
    def start_requests(self):
        if self.make_requests_from_url.__func__ is not Spider.make_requests_from_url:
            warnings.warn(
                "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
                "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
                "Please override start_requests method instead."
            )
            for url in self.start_urls:
                yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
        else:
            for url in self.start_urls:
                yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```

In the corrected code, we use `self.make_requests_from_url.__func__` to get the original function from the base class and compare it with `Spider.make_requests_from_url`. This checks whether the method has been overridden in the current class. If not, it emits a warning and uses the `Request()` function to yield a request.
