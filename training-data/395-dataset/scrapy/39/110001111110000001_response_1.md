The error seems to be occurring in the test `test_make_requests_from_url_deprecated` due to the assertion `self.assertEqual(len(w), 0)`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the comparison `if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url`. This comparison is probably causing the warning to be incorrectly issued for spiders that have overridden the `make_requests_from_url` method.

The presence of the warning in the code suggests that the method `make_requests_from_url` is being deprecated and the `start_requests` method needs to be implemented instead. 

To fix the bug, we should remove the comparison `if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url` and always yield `Request` objects instead of using the `make_requests_from_url` method. Spiders should use the `start_requests` method to make requests, replacing any usage of `make_requests_from_url`.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    warnings.warn(
        "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
        "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
        "Please override start_requests method instead."
    )
    for url in self.start_urls:
        yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```
