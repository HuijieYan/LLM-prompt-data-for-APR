The buggy function `start_requests` is checking if the method `make_requests_from_url` is equal to `Spider.make_requests_from_url`, and if not, it is trying to yield requests from the `start_urls` using `self.make_requests_from_url`. If they are equal, it yields a request directly.

The bug occurs because `self.make_requests_from_url` is never equal to `Spider.make_requests_from_url` due to the differences in instance and class methods comparison. This comparison doesn't make sense, and it always falls into the `else` block.

To fix this bug, we need to simplify the comparison and always call `self.make_requests_from_url` regardless.

Here's the corrected code for the `start_requests` function:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    warnings.warn(
        "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
        "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
        "Please override start_requests method instead."
    )
    for url in self.start_urls:
        yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
```
