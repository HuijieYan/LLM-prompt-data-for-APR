The error occurs in the `start_requests` method of the `Spider` class. The purpose of this method is to generate the initial `Request` objects for the spider to start crawling.

The bug occurs because the `if` condition should be checking if `self.make_requests_from_url` is not equal to `Spider.make_requests_from_url`, rather than comparing them. The intention is to check if the `make_requests_from_url` method has been overridden in the spider subclass.

Based on the provided descriptions, it seems that the purpose of `make_requests_from_url` method is to generate requests from the `start_urls`. If the method has not been overridden in the spider subclass, it should default to using the `Request` objects directly from the `start_urls`.

To fix the bug, the `start_requests` method should be updated as follows:

```python
import warnings
from scrapy import Request
from scrapy.spiders import Spider

def start_requests(self):
    if self.make_requests_from_url != Spider.make_requests_from_url:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```

With this code, the `start_requests` method will check if the `make_requests_from_url` method has been overridden in the spider subclass and use it to generate the initial requests. If it hasn't been overridden, it will default to using the `Request` objects directly from the `start_urls`.
