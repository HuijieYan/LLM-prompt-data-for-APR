The error in the test case indicates that the function is not working as expected and is not issuing a warning as it should. The error occurs because the `start_requests` method in the `Spider` class is using `self.make_requests_from_url` to check if it's different from `Spider.make_requests_from_url`. This check is incorrect and is causing the method to behave incorrectly.

The reason for the bug is that the method is mistakenly comparing the instance method `self.make_requests_from_url` with the class method `Spider.make_requests_from_url`. This comparison does not accurately determine if the method has been overridden.

To fix the bug, we need to compare the instance method with the method from the superclass, which can be done using the `super()` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `start_requests` method in the `Spider` class:

```python
class Spider(object_ref):
    """
    Base class for scrapy spiders. All spiders must inherit from this
    class.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def start_requests(self):
        # Use super to get the class method
        base_make_requests_from_url = super(Spider, self).make_requests_from_url

        # Compare the instance method with the class method
        if self.make_requests_from_url is not base_make_requests_from_url:
            warnings.warn(
                "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
                "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
                "Please override start_requests method instead."
            )
            for url in self.start_urls:
                yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
        else:
            for url in self.start_urls:
                yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```

By using `super()` to retrieve the class method, we can properly compare it with the instance method to determine if it has been overridden.
