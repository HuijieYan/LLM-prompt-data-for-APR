The error message from the test function indicates that the assertion `self.assertEqual(len(w), 0)` failed. This means that the `start_requests` method is not behaving as expected and is likely not yielding the expected number of results when it encounters a spider with overridden `make_requests_from_url` method.

The potential error location within the `start_requests` method is in the conditional statement `if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url`. Since `make_requests_from_url` is an instance method, this conditional statement is not comparing the actual method implementations; instead, it's comparing the method objects themselves. This is likely the reason for the error, as it's not actually checking if the method has been overridden.

The reason behind the bug is that the comparison `self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url` is not the correct way to check if the method has been overridden. This comparison checks if the method object is the same as the method object in the Spider class, which is not the desired behavior.

To fix the bug, the `start_requests` method should be modified to correctly check if the `make_requests_from_url` method has been overridden. This can be done by comparing the method object of the spider class with the method object of the current instance.

Here's the corrected `start_requests` method:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    if getattr(self.make_requests_from_url, '__func__', None) != Spider.make_requests_from_url:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```

In the corrected code, `getattr(self.make_requests_from_url, '__func__', None)` is used to get the original function object, and then it's compared with the `Spider.make_requests_from_url` method to check if it has been overridden.
