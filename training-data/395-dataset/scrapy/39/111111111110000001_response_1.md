The error occurs in the test function `test_make_requests_from_url_deprecated` where it tries to assert that the length of `w` is 0, but it actually contains 1 element. This indicates that the warnings were not handled as expected.

The issue with the buggy function is that it's comparing the `make_requests_from_url` function using `if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url`. This comparison is incorrect because it's comparing the function objects themselves rather than the values they return. Also, it's attempting to compare a method defined in an instance with a method defined in the class.

To fix this, the comparison should be based on the value or functionality of the methods rather than the object itself. Additionally, since the purpose of the function is to check if the method has been overridden in a subclass, it should use `isinstance` to compare the method with the one defined in the `Spider` class.

The corrected function is as follows:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    if not isinstance(self.make_requests_from_url, Spider.make_requests_from_url):
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```
