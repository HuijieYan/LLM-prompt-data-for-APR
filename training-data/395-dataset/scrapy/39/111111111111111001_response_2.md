The error occurs in the test_make_requests_from_url_deprecated test case where it is trying to assert the length of warnings `w` to be 0. However, the length of `w` is coming out to be 1, leading to a test failure.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the condition `if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url`. This condition is to check if the `make_requests_from_url` method in the current class is overridden. However, it is comparing the method itself, rather than checking if it is overridden in the current class.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is the incorrect comparison between the methods, which does not accurately determine if the method is overridden in the current class.

To fix the bug, we should check if the method `make_requests_from_url` is defined in the current class, instead of comparing the method itself. We can use the `hasattr` function to achieve this and remove the obsolete comparison with `Spider.make_requests_from_url`.

Here's the corrected code:
```python
def start_requests(self):
    if hasattr(self, 'make_requests_from_url') and self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```
