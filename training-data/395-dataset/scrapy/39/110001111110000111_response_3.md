The test case `test_make_requests_from_url_deprecated` is trying to test the deprecation warning issued when using the `make_requests_from_url` method of a Spider. It creates two spiders, one with the default `make_requests_from_url` method and one with an overridden method. It then checks if the warning is issued and if the method still works. The error message indicates that the warning is not being issued as expected.

The potential error location within the `start_requests` method of the Spider is the condition `if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url`. This condition is trying to compare if the `make_requests_from_url` method of the current Spider instance is not the same as the default `make_requests_from_url` method of the Spider class. However, the comparison is incorrect and is likely causing the warning not to be issued.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is the incorrect comparison in the `start_requests` method. It is not effectively checking if the `make_requests_from_url` method has been overridden by the specific Spider instance.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to use Python's built-in `__func__` attribute to check if the method has been overridden by comparing it with the default `make_requests_from_url` method of the Spider class. This will effectively determine if the method has been overridden.

Here is the corrected code for the `start_requests` method:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    if self.make_requests_from_url.__func__ is not Spider.make_requests_from_url:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```

By using `self.make_requests_from_url.__func__` to compare with the default method, the `start_requests` method will now correctly issue the deprecation warning and handle the overridden method appropriately.
