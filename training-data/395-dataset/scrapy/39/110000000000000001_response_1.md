Potential error location: The error occurs in the if condition `if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url:`. This condition is comparing the `make_requests_from_url` attribute of `self` with `Spider.make_requests_from_url`. It seems like it should be checking if `make_requests_from_url` is not equal to `Spider.make_requests_from_url`.

Reasons behind the bug: The comparison operator `is not` is used incorrectly. It should be `!=` for checking the inequality of the two attributes.

Approach for fixing the bug: Change `is not` to `!=` in the if condition, and update the condition to compare the values of `make_requests_from_url` attributes.

Corrected code:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    if self.make_requests_from_url != Spider.make_requests_from_url:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```
