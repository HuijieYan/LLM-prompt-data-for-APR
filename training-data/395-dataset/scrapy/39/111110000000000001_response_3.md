Potential error location: The if statement comparing `self.make_requests_from_url` with `Spider.make_requests_from_url` may not be functioning as intended. 

Reasons behind the bug: The comparison in the if statement is checking whether the two functions refer to the same object in memory, which may not yield the expected results.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The intention of the code seems to be to check if the `make_requests_from_url` function has been overridden in a subclass. One approach to fix the bug is to use the `getattr` function to check if the function has been overridden. Another approach is to use `inspect.getmembers` to get all the methods of the class and check if `make_requests_from_url` exists in the methods list.

Corrected code:

```python
import warnings
from scrapy import Request

# class declaration containing the fixed function
class Spider(object_ref):
    """
    Base class for scrapy spiders. All spiders must inherit from this
    class.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def make_requests_from_url(self, url):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass


    # this is the fixed function
    def start_requests(self):
        if getattr(self.make_requests_from_url, '__func__', None) is not getattr(Spider.make_requests_from_url, '__func__', None):
            warnings.warn(
                "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
                "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
                "Please override start_requests method instead."
            )
            for url in self.start_urls:
                yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
        else:
            for url in self.start_urls:
                yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```
