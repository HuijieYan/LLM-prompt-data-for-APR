The error message indicates that the test case is failing because the number of warnings recorded (`len(w)`) is not as expected. This suggests that the warning is not being triggered as expected when the `start_requests` method is called.

The potential error location within the `start_requests` method is the condition `if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url`. This condition checks whether the `make_requests_from_url` method has been overridden in the subclass. However, this condition is not working as expected, leading to incorrect warning triggering.

The reason for the bug is that the condition `self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url` is not the correct way to check if the `make_requests_from_url` method has been overridden in the subclass. This condition is not effectively checking for method overriding.

To fix the bug, the condition should check if the method has been overridden using the `__func__` attribute. If the `make_requests_from_url` method is a bound method and its `__func__` attribute is the same as the `make_requests_from_url` method in `Spider`, then it has not been overridden.

Here's the corrected code for the `start_requests` method:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    if self.make_requests_from_url.__func__ is not Spider.make_requests_from_url:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```

The corrected condition `if self.make_requests_from_url.__func__ is not Spider.make_requests_from_url` effectively checks if the `make_requests_from_url` method has been overridden in the subclass.

With this change, the `start_requests` method should now work as expected, triggering the warning and yielding requests accordingly.
