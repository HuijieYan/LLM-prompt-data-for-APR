        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```
The method `make_requests_from_url` has been removed and instead, a new method `start_requests` with a warning message has been added for future Scrapy releases.
