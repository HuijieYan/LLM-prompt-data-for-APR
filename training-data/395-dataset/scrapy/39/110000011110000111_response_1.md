The test case "test_make_requests_from_url_deprecated" is trying to test if the warning is issued when a spider with the overridden "make_requests_from_url" method is used. The error message shows that the expected length of warnings is 0, but the actual length is 1, which indicates that the warning is being issued when it shouldn't be.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional check `if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url`. This check is incorrect because it's comparing functions themselves rather than their implementations. It should compare whether the overridden method is present in the current spider class.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the comparison `self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url` is comparing the function references, not the implementations. This comparison will always be False for any spider class instance with an overridden "make_requests_from_url" method.

To fix the bug, we need to compare if the method has been overridden in the current spider class rather than comparing function references.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    if getattr(self.make_requests_from_url, '__func__', None) is not getattr(Spider.make_requests_from_url, '__func__', None):
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```
In the corrected code, we use the `getattr` function to compare the bound methods of the current spider class and the base Spider class. This correctly checks if the method has been overridden in the current class.
