The bug is occurring in the `test_make_requests_from_url_deprecated` test case. The error message indicates that the test is failing at the assertion `self.assertEqual(len(w), 0)`, which means the warning is being raised when it shouldn't be.

The potential error location within the `start_requests` method of the `Spider` class. The issue seems to be with the condition `if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url`, which is triggering the warning erroneously.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the condition `if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url` is comparing methods instead of their behavior. This comparison does not take into account overridden methods by subclasses.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to check if `self.make_requests_from_url` is overridden by the current class and compare it with the original `Spider.make_requests_from_url` method. If it is overridden, then issue the warning; otherwise, proceed with the original `Spider.make_requests_from_url` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `start_requests` method:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    if self.make_requests_from_url.__func__ is not Spider.make_requests_from_url:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```

In the corrected code, we are checking whether the `make_requests_from_url` method directly belongs to the Spider class or has been overridden by a subclass. If it has been overridden, a warning is issued and the overridden method is used. Otherwise, the original `Spider.make_requests_from_url` method is used.
