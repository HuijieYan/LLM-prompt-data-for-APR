The error occurs in the `test_make_requests_from_url_deprecated` test case when it tries to assert the length of warnings `w` to be 0, but it's actually 1.

The bug is likely located in the `start_requests` method of the Spider class. The conditional check `if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url` seems to be incorrect as it's checking the method object directly, which can lead to unexpected behavior. 

The reason for the bug is that the conditional check is not properly comparing the methods. It should compare the methods based on their string representations or use a different approach to check if the method has been overridden in the subclass.

To fix this bug, we need to compare the method names instead of the method objects. After that, we should also update the warning message to reflect the correct method to override.

Here's the corrected code for the `start_requests` method:

```python
class Spider(object_ref):
    """
    Base class for scrapy spiders. All spiders must inherit from this
    class.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def make_requests_from_url(self, url):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass


    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def start_requests(self):
        if self.make_requests_from_url.__func__ is not Spider.make_requests_from_url:
            warnings.warn(
                "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
                "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
                "Please override make_requests_from_url method instead."
            )
            for url in self.start_urls:
                yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
        else:
            for url in self.start_urls:
                yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```

In the corrected code, we compare the methods using `__func__` attribute, which refers to the unbound method. This will help accurately determine if the method has been overridden in the subclass. Additionally, we updated the warning message to reflect the correct method to override.
