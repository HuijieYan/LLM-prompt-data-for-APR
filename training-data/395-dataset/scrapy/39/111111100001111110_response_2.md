```python
# Corrected function source code
def start_requests(self):
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```
In the corrected code, the start_requests method has been simplified to directly yield Request objects for the start_urls, with a deprecation warning for the make_requests_from_url method.
