The test case `test_make_requests_from_url_deprecated` is designed to check for the deprecation warning when the `make_requests_from_url` method is used within the `start_requests` method.

The error message indicates that the assertion `self.assertEqual(len(w), 0)` is failing, which suggests that the warning is not being issued when it should be.

The potential error location within the `start_requests` method is the conditional check `if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url`. This check is supposed to compare the `make_requests_from_url` method of the current instance with the one from the `Spider` class to determine if it's been overridden. However, this comparison is incorrect and doesn't achieve the intended functionality.

The reason behind the bug is that the comparison `if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url` compares the method objects instead of their actual definitions, leading to incorrect results. Additionally, it appears that the warning should be issued before the for loop to ensure it's displayed when necessary.

To fix the bug, we can use the `getattr` function to compare the method definitions. We can also reorder the code to issue the deprecation warning before the for loop.

Here's the corrected code for the `start_requests` method:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    if getattr(self.make_requests_from_url, '__func__', None) is not getattr(Spider.make_requests_from_url, '__func__', None):
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
    
    for url in self.start_urls:
        yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
```

With this fix, the comparison checks the actual definitions of the methods, and the deprecation warning is issued before the for loop to ensure it's displayed when necessary.
