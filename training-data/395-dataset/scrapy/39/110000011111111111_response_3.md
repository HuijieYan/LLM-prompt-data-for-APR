The error occurs when the `start_requests` method is called as it compares the `make_requests_from_url` attribute of the spider instance with the `Spider.make_requests_from_url` attribute. If they are not the same, a warning is issued and the method yields requests using the `make_requests_from_url` method, otherwise it yields requests using the `Request` class.

The bug occurs because in the test case, the comparison `self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url` is always true, resulting in the warning being issued. This comparison is not the correct way to check if the `make_requests_from_url` method has been overridden.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison and the way the method checks if `make_requests_from_url` has been overridden.

To fix the bug, the corrected function/method is provided below:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    make_requests_from_url = self.make_requests_from_url
    base_make_requests_from_url = Spider.make_requests_from_url
    if make_requests_from_url.__func__ is not base_make_requests_from_url:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```
