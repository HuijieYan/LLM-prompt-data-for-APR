The error message is indicating that the test is failing at the assertion `self.assertEqual(len(w), 0)`. This means that the `w` variable, which is the list of warnings, is not empty as expected. 

The issue in the `start_requests` function is that `if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url:` is comparing two functions and will only be True if `self.make_requests_from_url` is not the same function object as `Spider.make_requests_from_url`. This is not the intended comparison; it should be checking if `self.make_requests_from_url` has been overridden.

To fix the bug, we need to compare the methods themselves, not their identities. 

Here's the corrected code for the `start_requests` function:

```python
def start_requests(self):
    if self.make_requests_from_url.__func__ is not Spider.make_requests_from_url.__func__:
        warnings.warn(
            "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
            "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
            "Please override start_requests method instead."
        )
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield self.make_requests_from_url(url)
    else:
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```
