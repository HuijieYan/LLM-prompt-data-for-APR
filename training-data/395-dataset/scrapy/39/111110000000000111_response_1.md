Potential error location:
The if condition `if self.make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url:` is comparing the function object `make_requests_from_url` of the current instance with the function object `make_requests_from_url` of the Spider class. This comparison will always be true unless the `make_requests_from_url` method is overridden in a subclass.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The intention of the condition is to check if the `make_requests_from_url` method in the current instance is overridden. However, the comparison with `Spider.make_requests_from_url` does not achieve this.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
We can use the `getattr` method to dynamically get the `make_requests_from_url` method of the current instance and compare it with the `make_requests_from_url` method of the Spider class.

Corrected code:
```python
import warnings

class Spider(object_ref):
    """
    Base class for scrapy spiders. All spiders must inherit from this
    class.
    """

    def make_requests_from_url(self, url):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def start_requests(self):
        # dynamically get the make_requests_from_url method of the current instance
        current_make_requests_from_url = getattr(self, "make_requests_from_url", None)
        
        if current_make_requests_from_url is not Spider.make_requests_from_url:
            warnings.warn(
                "Spider.make_requests_from_url method is deprecated; "
                "it won't be called in future Scrapy releases. "
                "Please override start_requests method instead."
            )
            for url in self.start_urls:
                yield current_make_requests_from_url(url)
        else:
            for url in self.start_urls:
                yield Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```
