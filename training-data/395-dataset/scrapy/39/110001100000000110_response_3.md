# Corrected function source code
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_39/scrapy/spiders/__init__.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def make_requests_from_url(self, url):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

    # this is the corrected function
    def start_requests(self):
        for url in self.start_urls:
            yield scrapy.Request(url, dont_filter=True)
```
In the corrected function, the unnecessary check for `make_requests_from_url` has been removed, and the function now simply yields requests using `scrapy.Request`.
