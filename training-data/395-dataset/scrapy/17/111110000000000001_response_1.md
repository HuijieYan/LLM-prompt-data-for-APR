Potential error location: The error is most likely occurring in the line `to_native_str(http.RESPONSES.get(int(status)))`, as it seems to be referencing the `http` module but it is not imported in the function.

Reason for the bug: The `http` module is not imported within the function, so the `http` object is not available, resulting in a NameError.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Import the necessary module within the function, or pass the `http.RESPONSES` dictionary as a parameter to the function.

Corrected code:

```python
def response_status_message(status, responses):
    """Return status code plus status text descriptive message

    >>> response_status_message(200, http.RESPONSES)
    '200 OK'

    >>> response_status_message(404, http.RESPONSES)
    '404 Not Found'
    """
    return '%s %s' % (status, to_native_str(responses.get(int(status))))
```
