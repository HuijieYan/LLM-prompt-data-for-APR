The error message indicates that the function is trying to convert a 'NoneType' object to Unicode, which is causing a TypeError. This means that the function is not able to find the status code in the http.RESPONSES dictionary, resulting in a 'None' value being passed to the to_native_str function.

The potential error location within the function is the line that tries to retrieve the status text from the http.RESPONSES dictionary.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the http.RESPONSES dictionary does not contain a status text for the status code provided. This could be due to an incomplete or incorrect definition of the http.RESPONSES dictionary.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the http.RESPONSES dictionary contains all the required status codes and their corresponding status text. Another approach could be to handle the case where the status code is not found in the dictionary and return a default status text such as "Unknown Status".

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def response_status_message(status):
    """Return status code plus status text descriptive message

    >>> response_status_message(200)
    '200 OK'

    >>> response_status_message(404)
    '404 Not Found'
    """
    response_text = http.RESPONSES.get(int(status), "Unknown Status")
    return '%s %s' % (status, response_text)
```
