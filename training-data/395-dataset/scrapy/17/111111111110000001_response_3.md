The error message indicates that the function `to_native_str` is receiving a `NoneType` object, which is causing a `TypeError` when trying to convert it to a unicode representation.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the usage of the `to_native_str` function, which seems to be expecting a valid `text` input but receiving a `None` value instead.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely due to the `http.RESPONSES.get(int(status))` part of the code returning `None` when the status code is not recognized.

To fix the bug, we should handle the case when the status code is not found and return a default message like "Unknown Status". We can use a conditional statement to check if the response message exists for the status code, and if not, then return the default message.

Here's the corrected code for the `response_status_message` function:

```python
def response_status_message(status):
    """Return status code plus status text descriptive message

    >>> response_status_message(200)
    '200 OK'

    >>> response_status_message(404)
    '404 Not Found'
    """
    response_text = http.RESPONSES.get(int(status))
    if response_text:
        return '%s %s' % (status, to_native_str(response_text))
    else:
        return '%s %s' % (status, "Unknown Status")
```

With this correction, the function will now handle the case when the status code is not found in the `http.RESPONSES` dictionary, and it will return "Unknown Status" in that scenario. This should resolve the `NoneType` error and allow the test case to pass.
