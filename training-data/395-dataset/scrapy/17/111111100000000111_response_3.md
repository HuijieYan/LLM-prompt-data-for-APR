Potential error location: 
The potential error in the code is the use of the `to_native_str` and `http.RESPONSES` without importing them.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The code is trying to use the `to_native_str` function and `http.RESPONSES` dictionary without importing them, which leads to a NameError.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
Import the necessary modules and functions (`to_native_str` and `http.RESPONSES`) to resolve the NameError.

Corrected code:

```python
import http.client as http

def response_status_message(status):
    """Return status code plus status text descriptive message

    >>> response_status_message(200)
    '200 OK'

    >>> response_status_message(404)
    '404 Not Found'
    """
    return '%s %s' % (status, http.responses.get(int(status)))
```
