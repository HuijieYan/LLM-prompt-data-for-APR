The error is occurring in the `to_native_str` function which is being called within the `response_status_message` function. The error is due to the `to_native_str` function receiving a `NoneType` value for the `text` parameter, which is causing a `TypeError` to be raised.

The reason behind this bug is that the `http.RESPONSES.get` method is returning `None` for the status codes that are not recognized. This is causing the `to_native_str` function to receive a `None` value for the `text` parameter, resulting in the error.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the status code is not recognized and return an "Unknown Status" message in that case.

Here's the corrected code for the `response_status_message` function:

```python
def response_status_message(status):
    """Return status code plus status text descriptive message

    >>> response_status_message(200)
    '200 OK'

    >>> response_status_message(404)
    '404 Not Found'
    
    >>> response_status_message(573)
    '573 Unknown Status'
    """
    status_code = int(status)
    status_text = http.RESPONSES.get(status_code)
    if status_text is not None:
        return '%s %s' % (status, to_native_str(status_text))
    else:
        return '%s Unknown Status' % status
```
