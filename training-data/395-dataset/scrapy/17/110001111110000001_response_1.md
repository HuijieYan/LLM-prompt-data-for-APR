The error message indicates a TypeError in the `to_unicode` function which is being called from the `response_status_message` function. The `to_unicode` function is trying to convert a NoneType object to unicode, which is causing the error.

The bug in the `response_status_message` function is likely due to the `to_native_str` function being called with a NoneType object, which is causing the `to_unicode` function to raise a TypeError.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the status code is not found in the `http.RESPONSES` dictionary. We can do this by checking if the status code exists in the dictionary and returning a default "Unknown Status" message if it does not.

Here's the corrected code for the `response_status_message` function:

```python
def response_status_message(status):
    """Return status code plus status text descriptive message

    >>> response_status_message(200)
    '200 OK'

    >>> response_status_message(404)
    '404 Not Found'
    """
    status_text = http.RESPONSES.get(int(status))
    if status_text is not None:
        return '%s %s' % (status, to_native_str(status_text))
    else:
        return '%s Unknown Status' % status
```

With this correction, the function will check if the status code exists in the `http.RESPONSES` dictionary before trying to convert it to a native string. If it does not exist, it will return a default "Unknown Status" message.
