The error occurs due to the usage of the `to_native_str` function within the `response_status_message` function, which is not defined. This results in a `TypeError: to_unicode must receive a bytes, str or unicode object, got NoneType` when the status code is not found in the http.RESPONSES dictionary.

To fix the bug, the `to_native_str` function needs to be removed and directly use the dictionary `http.RESPONSES` to get the status text descriptive message based on the status code. Additionally, a default message "Unknown Status" should be provided in case the status code is not found in the dictionary.

Here's the corrected `response_status_message` function:

```python
def response_status_message(status):
    """Return status code plus status text descriptive message

    >>> response_status_message(200)
    '200 OK'

    >>> response_status_message(404)
    '404 Not Found'

    >>> response_status_message(573)
    '573 Unknown Status'
    """
    return '%s %s' % (status, http.RESPONSES.get(int(status), "Unknown Status"))
```
