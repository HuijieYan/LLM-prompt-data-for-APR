The potential error in the function response_status_message is at line 10 where to_native_str is being called. The function to_native_str is not defined in the given code, which causes a NameError.

The reason behind the bug is that the to_native_str function is not defined within the scope of the given code. This could be a missing import statement for the module where to_native_str is defined.

To fix the bug, we need to import the necessary module or define the to_native_str function within the scope of the given code.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_17/scrapy/utils/response.py
from http import HTTPStatus

# this is the corrected function
def response_status_message(status):
    """Return status code plus status text descriptive message

    >>> response_status_message(200)
    '200 OK'

    >>> response_status_message(404)
    '404 Not Found'
    """
    return '%s %s' % (status, HTTPStatus(status).phrase)
```
