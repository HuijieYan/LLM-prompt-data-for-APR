The error is likely occurring within the function `response_status_message` in the file `/Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_17/scrapy/utils/response.py`. The error message indicates that the `to_unicode` function is receiving a `NoneType` object instead of the expected `bytes`, `str`, or `unicode` object. This occurs when the `http.RESPONSES.get(int(status))` returns `None`, causing the error when trying to format the string.

It seems that the `RESPONSES` dictionary in the `http` module does not contain an entry for the status code 573, which causes the `get` method to return `None`. 

To fix this bug, you should modify the `response_status_message` function to handle the case where the status code is not found in the `RESPONSES` dictionary. You can use a default message such as "Unknown Status" in this case.

Here's the corrected code for the `response_status_message` function:

```python
def response_status_message(status):
    """Return status code plus status text descriptive message

    >>> response_status_message(200)
    '200 OK'

    >>> response_status_message(404)
    '404 Not Found'

    >>> response_status_message(573)
    '573 Unknown Status'
    """
    response_text = http.RESPONSES.get(int(status))
    if response_text is None:
        response_text = "Unknown Status"
    return '%s %s' % (status, to_native_str(response_text))
```

With this correction, the function now handles the case where the status code is not found in the `RESPONSES` dictionary and returns "Unknown Status" as the status text in that case.
