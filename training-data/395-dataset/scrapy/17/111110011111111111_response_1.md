The error in the code seems to be related to the `to_native_str` function, which is called with `http.RESPONSES.get(int(status))` as an argument. It seems that `http.RESPONSES.get(int(status))` is returning `None`, and the `to_native_str` function is not handling `None` correctly.

The reason behind this bug might be that the status code provided is not recognized by the `http` module, resulting in `None` being returned. The `to_native_str` function is not handling `None` as an input, which leads to a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `response_status_message` function to handle the case when `http.RESPONSES.get(int(status))` returns `None`. We can also provide a default response for unknown status codes.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def response_status_message(status):
    """Return status code plus status text descriptive message

    >>> response_status_message(200)
    '200 OK'

    >>> response_status_message(404)
    '404 Not Found'
    """
    response_text = http.RESPONSES.get(int(status))
    if response_text is not None:
        return '%s %s' % (status, to_native_str(response_text))
    else:
        return "%s Unknown Status" % status
```

With this modification, the function should handle unknown status codes gracefully and return the correct response message.
