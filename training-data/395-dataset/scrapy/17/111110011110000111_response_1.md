The error message indicates a "TypeError" in the "to_unicode" function within the "scrapy/utils/python.py" file. This error is raised because the "text" parameter passed to the "to_unicode" function is of type None, which is not expected by the function.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the call to the "to_native_str" function, which is likely returning a None value and causing the "to_unicode" function to raise a TypeError.

The bug occurred because the function is not handling the case where the status code passed to it is not recognized. In the test case, when the status code 573 is passed, the function is unable to find a corresponding status text for it, resulting in None being returned.

To fix the bug, we can modify the function to handle the case where an unrecognized status code is passed, and return a default status text in such cases.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# Corrected function
def response_status_message(status):
    """Return status code plus status text descriptive message

    >>> response_status_message(200)
    '200 OK'

    >>> response_status_message(404)
    '404 Not Found'

    >>> response_status_message(573)
    '573 Unknown Status'
    """
    default_status = 'Unknown Status'
    status_text = http.RESPONSES.get(int(status))
    if status_text:
        return '%s %s' % (status, to_native_str(status_text))
    else:
        return '%s %s' % (status, default_status)
```

With this modification, the function now handles unrecognized status codes by returning a default status text.
