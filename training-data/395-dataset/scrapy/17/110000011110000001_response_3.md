The error message indicates that the function `to_native_str` is receiving a `None` value for the `text` parameter, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to convert it to unicode.

The bug appears to be in the `response_status_message` function where it is using `to_native_str` incorrectly, causing the `None` value to be passed to it.

The reason for the bug is that the `http.RESPONSES.get(int(status))` is returning `None` when it cannot find the status code in the dictionary. This `None` value is then being passed to `to_native_str`, causing the TypeError.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where the status code is not found in the dictionary and provide a default message.

Here's the corrected code for the `response_status_message` function:

```python
def response_status_message(status):
    """Return status code plus status text descriptive message

    >>> response_status_message(200)
    '200 OK'

    >>> response_status_message(404)
    '404 Not Found'
    """
    response_text = http.RESPONSES.get(int(status))
    if response_text:
        return '%s %s' % (status, to_native_str(response_text))
    else:
        return '%s Unknown Status' % status
```

With this correction, we are checking if the `response_text` is not `None` before passing it to `to_native_str`. If it is `None`, we return a default "Unknown Status" message. This should fix the bug and allow the function to handle status codes not found in the dictionary.
