Potential Error Location: The error seems to be occurring in the `to_native_str` function in the `response_status_message` function. It is likely that the `http.RESPONSES.get(int(status))` is returning `None`, which is causing the `to_native_str` function to raise a `TypeError` due to the `text` variable being `None`.

Reason for the Bug: The bug is likely occurring because the status code passed to the `response_status_message` function is not found in the `http.RESPONSES` dictionary, resulting in a `None` value being returned.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if the status code exists in the `http.RESPONSES` dictionary before attempting to fetch its value.
2. If the status code is not found, return a default "Unknown Status" message.

Corrected Code:
```python
def response_status_message(status):
    """Return status code plus status text descriptive message

    >>> response_status_message(200)
    '200 OK'

    >>> response_status_message(404)
    '404 Not Found'
    """
    response_text = http.RESPONSES.get(int(status))
    if response_text:
        return '%s %s' % (status, to_native_str(response_text))
    else:
        return '%s %s' % (status, 'Unknown Status')
```
