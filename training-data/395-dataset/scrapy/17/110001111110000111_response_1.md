The error is occurring in the `response_status_message` function, specifically at the line where `to_native_str` is called. The error is a `TypeError` related to `to_unicode` function, indicating that it is receiving a `NoneType` object instead of the expected `bytes`, `str`, or `unicode` object.

The reason behind this bug is that the http.RESPONSES dictionary does not have a key corresponding to the status code 573, so when the `get` method is called, it returns `None`. This `None` value is then passed to `to_native_str`, resulting in the `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `response_status_message` function to handle cases where the status code does not exist in the http.RESPONSES dictionary. One approach could be to return "Unknown Status" if the status code is not found in the dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the `response_status_message` function:

```python
def response_status_message(status):
    """Return status code plus status text descriptive message

    >>> response_status_message(200)
    '200 OK'

    >>> response_status_message(404)
    '404 Not Found'
    
    >>> response_status_message(573)
    '573 Unknown Status'
    """
    response_text = http.RESPONSES.get(int(status))
    if response_text:
        return '%s %s' % (status, to_native_str(response_text))
    else:
        return '%s Unknown Status' % status
```
