The error message indicates that the expected and actual color values of the converted image are not matching. This suggests that the conversion of the image is not happening correctly.

The potential error in the provided function is in the logic for converting the image. The function is not properly handling the conversion of image format and size.

The bug occurs because the function does not effectively handle the conversion of images with different formats and sizes.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle image conversion based on its format and size. Additionally, the function should return the correct variables after image conversions.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3])
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

The corrected function ensures that the handling and conversion of image formats and sizes are properly carried out.
