The error message indicates that the test case is failing because the expected and actual values for the image colors are not matching. This can occur due to an incorrect conversion of the image.

Upon analyzing the function, it seems that there are a couple of issues that could lead to the bug:
1. When converting an RGBA image to RGB, the transparency values are not correctly handled.
2. When converting an image to JPEG format, the quality setting is not specified.

To fix the bug, the following approaches can be considered:
1. Ensure that the transparency values from the RGBA image are correctly handled when converting to RGB.
2. Set the quality parameter when saving the image in JPEG format.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageOps
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a white background image with alpha channel
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        # Composite the original image onto the white background to remove transparency
        image = Image.alpha_composite(background, image)
        # Convert the image to RGB
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = ImageOps.exif_transpose(image)  # Handle orientation based on exif data
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    # Specify the quality setting when saving as JPEG
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG', quality=95)
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected code:
1. For handling RGBA to RGB conversion, the `Image.alpha_composite()` function is used to compose the original image onto a white background, preserving the color and removing the transparency.
2. When saving the image as JPEG, the quality parameter is specified as 95, which is a common high-quality setting.
