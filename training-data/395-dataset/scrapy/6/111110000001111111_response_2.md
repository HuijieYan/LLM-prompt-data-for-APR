The buggy function `convert_image` has a few issues:

1. The condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':` is checking for the PNG format and RGBA mode, but the background color is only pasted if the condition is true. This means that if the format is not PNG or the mode is not RGBA, the function will not handle those cases correctly.

2. There is an issue with the line `background.paste(image, image)`. The second `image` argument should be a tuple representing the upper left corner, but it is currently passing the image object itself. This is incorrect and can lead to unexpected behavior.

3. The function always saves the image in JPEG format, regardless of the input format. This can lead to loss of image quality and incorrect output format.

To fix these issues, we can update the function as follows:

```python
from io import BytesIO
from PIL import Image

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0))
            image = background
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, format=image.format)
        return image, buf
```

In the updated code:
- We handle the case where the input format is not PNG or the mode is not RGBA by converting the image to RGB if necessary.
- We also use the original image format when saving the image to preserve the input format.

These updates should address the issues in the original function and provide the expected behavior for the different input cases.
