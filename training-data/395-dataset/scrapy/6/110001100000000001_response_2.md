# Corrected function source code
```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

Explanation:
The original function has several issues that need to be addressed:
1. The `Image` module from the Python Imaging Library (PIL) was not imported.
2. When creating the `background` image for PNG images with RGBA mode, the mode of the `background` image should be 'RGB' instead of 'RGBA'.
3. When using the `paste` method to paste the original image onto the `background` image, the syntax was incorrect.
4. It's not necessary to call `image.convert('RGB')` again after pasting onto the `background` image, as it's already in RGB mode.
5. The corrected code addresses these issues and should work as intended.
