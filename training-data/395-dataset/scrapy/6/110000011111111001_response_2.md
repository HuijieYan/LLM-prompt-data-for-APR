The error message indicates that the function is not returning the expected output in one of the test cases. The `getcolors()` method returns the colors present in the image, and it seems that the converted image is not returning the expected colors. 

The reason behind this bug could be due to the conditional statements in the `convert_image` function. The conditional check for `image.format` and `image.mode` might not be handling all the cases correctly, causing incorrect conversions for certain image formats and modes.

To fix the bug, the conditional statements should be modified to correctly handle all possible image format and mode combinations. Additionally, the thumbnail creation should be adjusted to ensure the aspect ratio is maintained.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageOps
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = ImageOps.grayscale(image).convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected code, the conditional statements have been modified to handle all image format and mode combinations. Additionally, the thumbnail creation has been adjusted to maintain the aspect ratio.
