The error is occurring in the `test_convert_image` function with the assertion `self.assertEquals(converted.getcolors(), [(10000, (205, 230, 255))])`. The test is failing because the `getcolors` method is returning different values than expected.

The issue lies within the `convert_image` function. It incorrectly handles the case where the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'. The code attempts to convert the image to RGB and then save it as a JPEG. This is causing data loss and altering the color information, leading to the failing test.

To fix this issue, the `convert_image` function should handle the PNG RGBA format differently. Instead of directly converting it to RGB and saving as JPEG, the RGBA image should be retained and saved as PNG.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageFile
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'PNG')  # Save as PNG to retain RGBA format
        return image, buf
    else:
        if image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

With this correction, the `convert_image` function will preserve the RGBA format for PNG images and correctly handle the conversion for other image formats. This should address the failing test case.
