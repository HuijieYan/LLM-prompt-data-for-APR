The potential error in the given function is in the `convert_image` method where the image format is checked and then processed based on its mode. The bug occurs when the image format is 'PNG' and its mode is 'RGBA'. In this case, the image is converted to 'RGB' format after pasting it on a new 'RGBA' background. However, the code logic is incorrect because it pastes the image onto the background, and then converts the background to RGB, effectively changing the format of the pasted image as well.

To fix this bug, the correct approach would be to create a new RGB background, paste the PNG image onto it, and then convert only the background to RGB, leaving the image as is.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` method:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected code:
- We create a new RGB background using `Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))`.
- Then we paste the PNG image onto the RGB background using `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)`.
- The image format conversion logic has been updated to resolve the issue as discussed above.
