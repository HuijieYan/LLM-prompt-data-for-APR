The error message indicates that there is a difference in the expected output and the actual output when comparing the colors returned from the `convert_image` function.

The potential error location within the `convert_image` function is the part where the image is converted to 'RGB' when the original format is 'RGBA'. In the case of transparency, the conversion is not preserving the original colors.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the conversion for images with transparency should preserve the original colors, but the current implementation is not handling this case correctly. This is causing the test case to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conversion logic to correctly handle images with transparency. One approach to fix this bug is to use the `Image.alpha_composite` method to blend the RGBA image with a white background before converting it to RGB.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    
        
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
            image = Image.alpha_composite(background, image)
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

With this correction, the `convert_image` function should now correctly handle images with transparency and preserve their original colors. This should resolve the failing test case.
