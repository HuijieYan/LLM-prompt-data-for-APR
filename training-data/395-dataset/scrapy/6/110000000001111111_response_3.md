The potential issue in the `convert_image` function is that it doesn't account for the case when the input image format is 'JPEG' and the mode is 'RGB'. In this case, the function should simply perform the image copy and thumbnail operations without any further conversions.

The bug occurs because the function only checks for the 'PNG' format and 'RGBA' mode, and doesn't handle the 'JPEG' format and 'RGB' mode properly.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `convert_image` function to properly handle the 'JPEG' format and 'RGB' mode when they are present.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.format == 'JPEG' and image.mode == 'RGB':
        pass  # No conversion needed for JPEG format and RGB mode
    else:
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In this corrected code, we added an `elif` condition to handle the case when the input image format is 'JPEG' and the mode is 'RGB'. In this case, we simply skip any conversion and continue with the image processing, including the copy, thumbnail, and saving operations.
