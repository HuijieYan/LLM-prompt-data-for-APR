The issue seems to be with the `convert_image` method in the `ImagesPipeline` class. The `convert_image` method is converting any image input to RGB format, regardless of its original format. This causes the test cases to fail, as they are expecting the converted images to retain their original colors.

The bug occurs because the condition to handle PNG with RGBA format is attempting to convert all images to RGB instead of only handling the RGBA images. Additionally, the code is not handling the case where the input image is already in RGB format.

To fix the bug:
1. Add a condition to handle the case where the input image is already in RGB format and does not need conversion.
2. Modify the condition that handles PNG with RGBA format to only convert images with that specific format.

Here's the corrected `convert_image` method:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

With these changes, the `convert_image` method should now correctly handle various input image formats and sizes. The test cases should pass without any errors.
