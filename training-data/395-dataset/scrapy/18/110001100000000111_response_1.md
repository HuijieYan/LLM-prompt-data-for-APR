1. The test case involves fetching a URL using Scrapy shell, which leads to a UnicodeDecodeError due to an incorrect decoding of the Content-Disposition header.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is where it attempts to split the content_disposition string to extract the filename.

3. The bug occurs because the function assumes that the Content-Disposition header is encoded in UTF-8, but it may not be the case. This incorrect assumption leads to a UnicodeDecodeError when attempting to decode the header.

4. To fix the bug, the function should decode the content_disposition string using the correct encoding and handle any potential decoding errors. Additionally, it should handle cases where the filename is not present in the Content-Disposition header.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
    try:
        # Extracting the filename from the Content-Disposition header
        _, options = parse_header(content_disposition)
        filename = options.get('filename')
        if filename:
            return self.from_filename(filename)
        else:
            return Response
    except Exception as e:
        # Handle any potential decoding errors
        return Response
```
