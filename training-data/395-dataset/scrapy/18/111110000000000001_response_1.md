Potential error location: The error is likely occurring in the line where the "filename" is being extracted from the "content_disposition". 

Reasons for the bug: The bug occurs because the code is trying to split the "content_disposition" using ';' and '=' without checking for potential errors. If the content_disposition is not in the expected format, it will result in an IndexError.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the content_disposition contains the expected format before splitting it.
2. Handle the IndexError by returning a default value or handling it in a different way.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
    try:
        content_parts = content_disposition.split(';')
        for part in content_parts:
            if part.strip().startswith("filename="):
                filename = part.split('=')[1].strip('"\'')
                return self.from_filename(filename)
        return Response
    except IndexError:
        return Response
```
