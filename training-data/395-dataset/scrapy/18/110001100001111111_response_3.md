The buggy function `from_content_disposition` decodes the `content_disposition` using the `to_native_str` function, which appears to incorrectly decode non-UTF-8 characters. This leads to a `UnicodeDecodeError` when the function is called with non-UTF-8 encoded `content_disposition`.

To fix this bug, the `to_native_str` function should be modified to handle non-UTF-8 encoded strings properly, or it should be replaced with an alternative method to decode the `content_disposition`.

Here's the corrected code for the `from_content_disposition` function:

```python
def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
    try:
        filename = content_disposition.split(b'filename=')[1].strip(b'"\';')
        return self.from_filename(filename.decode('utf-8', errors='replace'))
    except IndexError:
        return Response
```

In this corrected code, we directly decode the `content_disposition` using the 'utf-8' encoding and handle any decoding errors by replacing them with a placeholder character. This should prevent the `UnicodeDecodeError` from occurring.
