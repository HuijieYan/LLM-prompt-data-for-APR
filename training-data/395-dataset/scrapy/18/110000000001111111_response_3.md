The error is likely occurring in the `from_content_disposition` function due to the attempt to decode the `content_disposition` header using the `utf-8` encoding.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `content_disposition` header may contain non-UTF-8 encoded characters, resulting in a `UnicodeDecodeError`.

To fix the bug, the `from_content_disposition` function should handle decoding of the `content_disposition` header using the appropriate encoding, which may not always be `utf-8`.

Here's the corrected code for the `from_content_disposition` function:

```python
def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
    try:
        content_disposition_str = content_disposition.decode('iso-8859-1')  # Using ISO-8859-1 encoding
        filename = content_disposition_str.split(';')[1].split('=')[1]
        filename = filename.strip('"\'')
        return self.from_filename(filename)
    except (IndexError, UnicodeDecodeError):
        return None  # Return appropriate value when an error occurs
```

In this corrected code:
- The `content_disposition` header is decoded using the ISO-8859-1 encoding, which is commonly used for HTTP headers and allows for a wider range of characters.
- The `UnicodeDecodeError` is caught and handled by returning an appropriate value, such as `None`, when an error occurs.

This should address the issue of decoding the `content_disposition` header and prevent the occurrence of the `UnicodeDecodeError`.
