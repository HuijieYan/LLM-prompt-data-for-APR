Potential error location: The error occurs at the line `filename = to_native_str(content_disposition).split(';')[1].split('=')[1]` where the content_disposition is being converted to a native string and then split using delimiters.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug occurs because the splitting method does not properly account for different types of content_disposition values, specifically those with non-ASCII characters.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use a decoding approach that can handle different types of content_disposition values, including those with non-ASCII characters.
2. Use a regular expression to extract the filename from the content_disposition string, ensuring that it accounts for different character encodings.

Corrected code:

```python
import re

def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
    try:
        content_disposition_str = content_disposition.decode('utf-8')  # Decode the content_disposition to handle non-ASCII characters
        filename_match = re.search(r'filename=["\']?([-\w. ]+)["\']?', content_disposition_str)  # Use a regular expression to extract the filename
        if filename_match:
            filename = filename_match.group(1)
            return self.from_filename(filename)
        else:
            return Response  # Replace this with the appropriate response or error handling
    except (IndexError, UnicodeDecodeError):
        return Response  # Replace this with the appropriate response or error handling
```

In the corrected code, we use `content_disposition.decode('utf-8')` to decode the `content_disposition` from bytes to a string, handling non-ASCII characters. Then, we use a regular expression to extract the filename from the content_disposition string. If a match is found, we return the result of `self.from_filename(filename)`. Otherwise, we provide a response or error handling based on the specific requirements. We also added a `UnicodeDecodeError` exception handling for better error management.
