The buggy function `from_content_disposition` is meant to extract the filename from the `Content-Disposition` header. The bug occurs because the function assumes that the input `content_disposition` is of type `str`, but it is actually of type `bytes`. This causes the decoding error when trying to split the input.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `content_disposition` is properly decoded from bytes to a string before splitting it based on the semicolons and equals signs.

Here's the corrected code for the `from_content_disposition` function:

```python
class ResponseTypes(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def from_filename(self, filename):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    # corrected from_content_disposition function
    def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
        try:
            content_disposition = content_disposition.decode('utf-8')  # decode bytes to string
            filename = content_disposition.split(';')[1].split('=')[1]
            filename = filename.strip('"\'')
            return self.from_filename(filename)
        except (UnicodeDecodeError, IndexError):
            return Response
```

In the corrected code, the `content_disposition` is first decoded from bytes to a string using the `utf-8` encoding. Then, the splitting and extraction of the filename is performed as before. The `except` block now catches both `UnicodeDecodeError` and `IndexError` in case decoding or splitting fails.
