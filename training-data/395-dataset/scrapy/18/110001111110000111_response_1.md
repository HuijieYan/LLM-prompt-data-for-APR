The error is occurring in the `from_content_disposition` method of the `responsetypes.py` file. The error is due to the encoding mismatch when trying to decode the `Content-Disposition` header using UTF-8. The header might be encoded in a different encoding, leading to a `UnicodeDecodeError`.

To fix this bug, we need to handle different encodings for the `Content-Disposition` header. We can use the `email` module to parse the header and extract the filename. This module automatically handles header parsing and decoding.

Here is the corrected `from_content_disposition` method:

```python
import email

def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
    try:
        _, params = email.header.decode_header(content_disposition)[0]
        filename, encoding = params.split(';')
        if 'filename' in filename:
            _, filename = filename.split('=')
            return self.from_filename(filename.strip('"\''))
    except IndexError:
        return Response
```

In this corrected method, we are using the `email.header` module to decode the `Content-Disposition` header. It automatically handles the decoding and parsing of the header parameters, allowing us to extract the filename and its encoding. We then use the extracted filename to call the `from_filename` method and return the appropriate response type.

This approach ensures that we handle different encodings and variations of the `Content-Disposition` header, preventing the `UnicodeDecodeError` that was occurring in the original method.
