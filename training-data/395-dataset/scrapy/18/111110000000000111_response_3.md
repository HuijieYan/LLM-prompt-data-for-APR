Potential error location: The line "filename = to_native_str(content_disposition).split(';')[1].split('=')[1]" is trying to split the content disposition header using a semicolon and then an equal sign without checking if those delimiters actually exist in the header.

Reasons for bug occurrence: The error occurs because the content disposition header is being decoded using utf-8, but the encoding was not actually utf-8. This results in a UnicodeDecodeError due to an invalid start byte.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: We need to handle the case where the delimiters ';' and '=' may not exist in the content disposition header. We can do this by using the `split` method with a maximum split value and adding error handling for cases where the expected delimiters are not found.

Corrected code:
```python
class ResponseTypes(object):
    # ... omitted code ...


    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def from_filename(self, filename):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass



    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
        try:
            content = to_native_str(content_disposition)
            filename = content.split(';', 1)[1].split('=', 1)[1].strip('"\'')
            return self.from_filename(filename)
        except (IndexError, UnicodeDecodeError):
            return Response
```
