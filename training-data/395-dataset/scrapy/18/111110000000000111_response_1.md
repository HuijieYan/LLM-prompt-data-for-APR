The error is occurring in the `from_content_disposition` method of the `ResponseTypes` class. The error seems to be related to decoding the `Content-Disposition` header using utf-8, but the encoding is not actually utf-8.

The bug is caused by assuming that the `Content-Disposition` header can be split on the semicolon and equal sign to obtain the filename, without considering that the filename itself might contain semicolons or equal signs.

To fix this bug, we should use the `email` module to parse the `Content-Disposition` header and extract the filename from it.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import email
from email.message import EmailMessage

class ResponseTypes(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
        msg = EmailMessage()
        msg['Content-Disposition'] = content_disposition
        filename = msg.get_filename()
        if filename:
            return self.from_filename(filename)
        else:
            return Response
```

This approach uses the `email` module to parse the `Content-Disposition` header and extract the filename. This should fix the bug and correctly handle different encodings and filename formats.
