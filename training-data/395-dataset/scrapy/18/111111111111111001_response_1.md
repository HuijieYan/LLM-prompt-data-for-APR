The error is a UnicodeDecodeError, specifically at the line `filename = to_native_str(content_disposition).split(';')[1].split('=')[1]` in the `from_content_disposition` method. This error occurs because the `content_disposition` is being decoded with the 'utf-8' encoding, which leads to the UnicodeDecodeError when encountering certain non-UTF-8 characters.

To fix this bug, we need to change the encoding to correctly handle the non-UTF-8 characters. We can use the 'latin-1' encoding, which is capable of representing every byte value as a Unicode code point.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
# corrected from_content_disposition method
def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
    try:
        filename = to_native_str(content_disposition, encoding='latin-1').split(';')[1].split('=')[1]
        filename = filename.strip('"\'')
        return self.from_filename(filename)
    except IndexError:
        return Response
```

With this change, the `from_content_disposition` method should now handle non-UTF-8 characters in the `content_disposition` correctly and avoid the UnicodeDecodeError.
