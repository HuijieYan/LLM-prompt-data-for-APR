The error message indicates a UnicodeDecodeError caused by trying to decode bytes with the 'utf-8' codec. This error occurs in the `to_native_str` function in the `scrapy/utils/python.py` file, which is called from the `from_content_disposition` function in the `scrapy/responsetypes.py` file.

The bug occurs because the `to_native_str` function is trying to decode a byte string with 'utf-8' encoding that contains non-utf-8 characters. This is likely because the file name in the `content_disposition` header contains non-utf-8 characters, which causes the decoding error.

To fix this bug, we need to handle non-utf-8 characters when decoding the `content_disposition` header. One approach is to use a different decoding strategy, such as 'latin-1', to prevent the UnicodeDecodeError when encountering non-utf-8 characters.

Here's the corrected code for the `from_content_disposition` function:

```python
def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
    try:
        filename = content_disposition.split(';')[1].split('=')[1]
        filename = filename.strip('"\'')
        return self.from_filename(filename)
    except IndexError:
        return Response
```

In this corrected code, we have removed the call to `to_native_str` and directly split the `content_disposition` string to extract the file name. This bypasses the encoding issue and should handle files with non-utf-8 characters in their names.
