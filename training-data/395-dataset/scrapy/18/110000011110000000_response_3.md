```python
# Corrected function/method
def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
    try:
        filename = to_native_str(content_disposition).split(';')[1].split('=')[1]
        filename = filename.strip('"\'')
        return self.from_filename(filename)
    except IndexError:
        return Response # This should be replaced with the correct Response class
```

We are not provided with the Response class, so it needs to be replaced with the correct class.
