The error occurs in the `from_content_disposition` method of the `ResponseTypes` class. The error is caused by assuming that the `content_disposition` header is in UTF-8 encoding, which may not always be the case. This leads to a `UnicodeDecodeError` when trying to decode the header value using UTF-8.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the different encodings that may be used in the `content_disposition` header. We can modify the code to decode the `content_disposition` header using different encodings in a try-except block, and if decoding is successful, then proceed to split and extract the filename.

Here's the corrected code for the `from_content_disposition` method:

```python
def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
    try:
        encodings = ['utf-8', 'latin-1', 'gbk', 'cp720', 'iso2022_jp']
        for encoding in encodings:
            try:
                filename = content_disposition.decode(encoding).split(';')[1].split('=')[1].strip('"\'')

                # If decoding and filename extraction were successful, return the result
                return self.from_filename(filename)
            except (UnicodeDecodeError, IndexError):
                pass
        # If no successful decode and extraction, return default Response
        return Response
    except AttributeError:
        return Response
```

This code handles the decoding of the `content_disposition` header using different encodings and then splits and extracts the filename. If the decoding is successful, it returns the result using the `from_filename` method. If no successful decode and extraction are achieved, it returns the default `Response`.

This approach should fix the bug and make the `from_content_disposition` method more resilient to different encodings used in the `content_disposition` header.
