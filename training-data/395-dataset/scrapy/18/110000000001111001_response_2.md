Potential error location: 
The error occurs when trying to retrieve the filename from the content_disposition. The function assumes that the filename is always at index 1 after splitting the content_disposition string, which results in an IndexError when the assumption is not met.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The buggy function assumes a fixed position for the filename within the content_disposition, which may not always be the case. This assumption leads to the IndexError when attempting to access an index that does not exist.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we can use a more reliable method for extracting the filename from the content_disposition. One approach could be to use regular expressions to match and extract the filename, as this would allow for more flexibility in handling different content_disposition formats.

Another approach could be to split the content_disposition string and iterate over the parts to find the one containing the filename, rather than assuming its position.

Additionally, it's important to handle the case where the content_disposition does not contain a filename to avoid the IndexError.

Corrected code:
```python
import re

def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
    try:
        match = re.search(r'filename=["\']?([^"\';]+)["\']?', content_disposition.decode('utf-8'))
        if match:
            filename = match.group(1)
            return self.from_filename(filename)
        else:
            return None  # Handle the case where filename is not found
    except IndexError:
        return None  # Handle the case where an IndexError occurs
```
