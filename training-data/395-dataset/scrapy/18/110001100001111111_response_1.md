The buggy function tries to decode the `Content-Disposition` header using the `to_native_str` function from the `scrapy.utils.python` module. The problem arises from the fact that the function assumes the header is encoded in UTF-8, which may not always be the case.

The bug occurs when the `Content-Disposition` header contains non-UTF-8 characters, causing a `UnicodeDecodeError` when attempting to decode the header as UTF-8.

To fix the bug, the `from_content_disposition` function should handle potential decoding errors and be more flexible in dealing with different encodings. It can use the `email.header` module to parse the `Content-Disposition` header and extract the filename in a more robust way.

Here's the corrected code for the `from_content_disposition` function:

```python
import email.header

def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
    try:
        _, params = email.header.decode_header(content_disposition.decode('utf-8'))[0]
        filename = params.split('filename=')[-1]
        return self.from_filename(filename.strip('"\''))
    except (UnicodeDecodeError, IndexError):
        return Response  # Replace with appropriate handling or error reporting
```

In the corrected code, we use the `email.header.decode_header` function to handle the decoding of the `Content-Disposition` header. Then, we extract the filename from the decoded header and pass it to the `from_filename` function. We also handle potential decoding errors and index errors that could occur during the extraction process. Finally, we return an appropriate response or handle the errors accordingly.
