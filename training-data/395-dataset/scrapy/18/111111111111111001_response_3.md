The error message indicates a UnicodeDecodeError, specifically stating that the 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xb5 in position 24, which points to the conversion from bytes to string using the 'utf-8' codec.

The bug is caused by the `to_native_str()` function attempting to decode the `content_disposition` bytes object using the 'utf-8' codec, which leads to a UnicodeDecodeError.

To fix the bug, we should handle the decoding of the `content_disposition` bytes object properly according to the content-type.

Here's the corrected code for the `from_content_disposition` function:

```python
def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
    try:
        disposition_str = content_disposition.decode('utf-8', 'ignore')
        filename = disposition_str.split(';')[1].split('=')[1]
        filename = filename.strip('"\'')
        return self.from_filename(filename)
    except (IndexError, UnicodeDecodeError):
        return Response
```

In this corrected code:
- We first decode the `content_disposition` bytes object using the 'utf-8' codec and the 'ignore' error handling option to ignore any decoding errors.
- Then, we continue with the remaining logic for extracting the filename and returning the result.

This corrected code should handle the encoding and decoding issues, resolving the UnicodeDecodeError and other potential issues related to byte-to-string conversion.
