The error occurs in the `from_content_disposition` function in the line `filename = to_native_str(content_disposition).split(';')[1].split('=')[1]`. This line attempts to split the `content_disposition` string based on `;` and `=` and access the filename value. However, in the test case, the `content_disposition` contains non-UTF-8 characters, resulting in a `UnicodeDecodeError`.

The bug occurs because the code is trying to decode the byte string `content_disposition` using the 'utf-8' codec, which fails when encountering non-UTF-8 characters.

To fix this bug, we can replace the line that causes the error with a more robust and Pythonic method to parse the content disposition header. We can use a library like `webob` to parse the content disposition header and extract the filename.

Here's the corrected code for the `from_content_disposition` function:

```python
from webob import headerparse

def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
    try:
        params = headerparse.parse_dict_header(content_disposition.decode('ISO-8859-1'))
        filename = params.get('filename')
        if filename:
            return self.from_filename(filename)
    except (IndexError, UnicodeDecodeError):
        return Response
```

In this corrected code:
- We use `headerparse` from the `webob` library to parse the content disposition header, regardless of the characters it contains.
- We decode `content_disposition` using the 'ISO-8859-1' encoding, which can handle a wider range of characters.
- We extract the filename from the parsed header using the `.get('filename')` method, which is more reliable than manual string splitting.

This approach should handle the non-UTF-8 characters present in the content disposition headers, and it provides a more robust and Pythonic way to parse HTTP headers.
