The bug in the `from_content_disposition` function is caused by the way the `content_disposition` value is processed. This value is expected to be in bytes, but the function is attempting to convert it to a native string using a function `to_native_str()` that is not defined in the given code. Additionally, the function splits the `content_disposition` string using semicolons and equal signs, which is not a robust way to parse the content disposition header.

To fix this bug, use the `decode` method to convert the `content_disposition` bytes to a string and then use regular expressions to extract the filename. Regular expressions provide a more robust way to parse the content disposition header.

Here's the corrected code for the `from_content_disposition` function:

```python
import re

class ResponseTypes(object):
    # ... omitted code ...
    
    # corrected from_content_disposition function
    def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
        content_disposition_str = content_disposition.decode('utf-8')
        filename_match = re.search(r'filename=["\']?([^"\';]+)["\']?$', content_disposition_str)
        if filename_match:
            filename = filename_match.group(1)
            return self.from_filename(filename)
        else:
            return Response
```

In the corrected code, `decode` is used to convert the `content_disposition` bytes to a UTF-8 string. Then, a regular expression is used to extract the filename from the content disposition header. This approach is more robust and handles different types of content disposition headers.
