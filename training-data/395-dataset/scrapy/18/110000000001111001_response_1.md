The potential error location within the problematic function is the line:
```python
return Response
```

The bug occurs when trying to extract the filename from the `content_disposition` header, as the code is splitting the header based on ';' and '=' signs, which may not work as expected in all cases. Additionally, the bug occurs because the function is not handling the encoding of filenames correctly.

To fix the bug, we can use Python's `email` module, which provides a `content_disposition` class that can be used to parse the `Content-Disposition` header. This will handle the encoding of filenames correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import email
from email.utils import parseaddr

def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
    if content_disposition:
        content_disposition_header = email.message_from_bytes(content_disposition)
        filename = content_disposition_header.get_filename()
        # handle non-ascii filenames
        if filename:
            filename = parseaddr(filename)[0]
        return self.from_filename(filename)
    else:
        return None
```
