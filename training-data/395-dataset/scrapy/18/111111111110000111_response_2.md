The error occurs when the `from_content_disposition` function tries to decode the `content_disposition` using the `to_native_str` function, which then tries to decode the byte string using UTF-8. However, the encoding is not always UTF-8, which causes a UnicodeDecodeError.

To fix the bug, the `from_content_disposition` function should handle different encodings for decoding the `content_disposition` string.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
    try:
        if isinstance(content_disposition, bytes):
            content_disposition = content_disposition.decode('utf-8', 'ignore')
        filename = content_disposition.split(';')[1].split('=')[1]
        filename = filename.strip('"\'')
        return self.from_filename(filename)
    except (UnicodeDecodeError, IndexError):
        return Response
```

In the corrected code:
- We explicitly decode the `content_disposition` string if it's a bytes object using the UTF-8 encoding, with the `ignore` error handling to ignore any invalid characters.
- Then we proceed to extract the filename as before and return the result as needed.
- We handle both UnicodeDecodeError and IndexError exceptions, returning `Response` in case of any error.

This should solve the issue with decoding the `content_disposition` string and correctly extracting the filename.
