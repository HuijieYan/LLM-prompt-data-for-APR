The buggy function `from_content_disposition` is supposed to extract the filename from the 'Content-Disposition' header of an HTTP response and then call the `from_filename` method in the `ResponseTypes` class with the extracted filename. For some cases (e.g., Buggy case 3 and Buggy case 5), the extracted filename is not encoded correctly due to non-ASCII characters, resulting in incorrect behavior.

To fix this issue, the `to_native_str` function should be used to handle non-ASCII characters before splitting the filename from the content disposition.

```python
def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
    try:
        filename = content_disposition.decode('utf-8').split(';')[1].split('=')[1]
        filename = to_native_str(filename.strip('"\''))
        return self.from_filename(filename)
    except IndexError:
        return Response
```

This updated function ensures that the content disposition is decoded using UTF-8 and then the `to_native_str` function is used to handle non-ASCII characters before calling the `from_filename` method. This should handle non-ASCII characters correctly and fix the issue.
