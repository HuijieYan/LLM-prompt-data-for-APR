The error is occurring in the `from_content_disposition` method of the `ResponseTypes` class. The method tries to decode the `content_disposition` using the `to_native_str` method, which in turn tries to decode the text using the 'utf-8' encoding. However, it seems that the actual encoding of the `content_disposition` is not UTF-8, leading to a `UnicodeDecodeError`.

To fix this bug, we should handle the decoding of `content_disposition` properly by specifying the correct encoding. This can be done by considering different encodings until the decoding process is successful.

Here's the corrected code for the `from_content_disposition` method:

```python
class ResponseTypes(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def from_filename(self, filename):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
        possible_encodings = ['utf-8', 'latin-1', 'gbk', 'cp720', 'iso2022_jp']

        for encoding in possible_encodings:
            try:
                filename = to_native_str(content_disposition, encoding=encoding)
                filename = filename.split(';')[1].split('=')[1]
                filename = filename.strip('"\'')
                return self.from_filename(filename)
            except (IndexError, UnicodeDecodeError):
                # Move on to the next encoding
                continue
        
        # If none of the encodings work, return the default response
        return Response
```

In the corrected code, we iterate over a list of possible encodings and attempt to decode the `content_disposition` using each encoding until we find one that works. If none of the encodings work, we return the default response.

This approach will handle different encodings that might be present in the `content_disposition`, preventing the `UnicodeDecodeError` and resolving the bug.
