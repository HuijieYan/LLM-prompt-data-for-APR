The error is occurring in the function `from_content_disposition` of the `ResponseTypes` class. The code is trying to split the content disposition string using the semicolon and equal sign, but when the string is not in the expected format, it is throwing a `UnicodeDecodeError`.

The reason this error is occurring is that the text is being decoded using the `utf-8` encoding, and the byte sequence `0xb5` is not a valid start byte in `utf-8`.

To fix this bug, we should handle the decoding of the byte string properly, taking into account the encoding and potential errors.

Here's the corrected code for the `from_content_disposition` function:

```python
def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
    try:
        if not isinstance(content_disposition, str):
            content_disposition = content_disposition.decode('utf-8')

        filename = content_disposition.split(';')[1].split('=')[1]
        filename = filename.strip('"\'')
        return self.from_filename(filename)
    except (IndexError, UnicodeDecodeError):
        return Response
```

In the corrected code, we are first checking whether `content_disposition` is a string, and if not, we are decoding it using the `utf-8` encoding. Then we proceed with splitting and processing the filename. Additionally, we catch `UnicodeDecodeError` along with `IndexError` in the `except` block to handle any potential decoding errors.
