The buggy function `from_content_disposition` is trying to extract the filename from the `content_disposition` string and then call the `from_filename` method. However, the bug occurs when splitting the `content_disposition` string using the ';' character, as it may not always have the correct format.

To fix the bug, we can use regular expressions to extract the filename from the `content_disposition` string, as this method is more robust and can handle different formats.

Here's the corrected code for the `from_content_disposition` function:

```python
import re

# class declaration containing the corrected function
class ResponseTypes(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
        try:
            match = re.search(r'filename="([^"]+)"', content_disposition)
            if match:
                filename = match.group(1)
                return self.from_filename(filename)
            else:
                return Response
        except IndexError:
            return Response
```

With this fix, the function uses regular expressions to extract the filename from the `content_disposition` string and then calls the `from_filename` method with the extracted filename. This way, it handles different formats of the `content_disposition` string correctly.
