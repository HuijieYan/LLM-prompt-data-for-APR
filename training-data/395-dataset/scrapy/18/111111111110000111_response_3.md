The test case `test_from_content_disposition` is testing the `from_content_disposition` method of the `ResponseTypes` class. It is passing different forms of the `Content-Disposition` header and checking if the expected response type matches the actual response type.

The error is originated from the `from_content_disposition` method at line 62 in `responsetypes.py`, where the `content_disposition` is being decoded using utf-8. However, in some cases, the encoding is not utf-8, leading to a `UnicodeDecodeError`.

The bug occurred because the `from_content_disposition` method incorrectly assumes the encoding of `Content-Disposition` to be utf-8 without checking the actual encoding. In cases where the encoding is not utf-8, it raises a `UnicodeDecodeError`.

To fix the bug, the `from_content_disposition` method should decode the `Content-Disposition` using the correct encoding. Additionally, proper error handling should be applied to handle cases where the decoding fails.

Here's the corrected code for the `from_content_disposition` method:

```python
def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
    try:
        filename = content_disposition.split(';')[1].split('=')[1]
        filename = filename.strip('"\'')
        return self.from_filename(filename)
    except IndexError:
        return Response
```

In the corrected code, we are not using `to_native_str` to decode `content_disposition`. Instead, we are directly splitting the string based on the ';' and '=' characters, assuming the correct encoding is used in the `Content-Disposition` header. If the decoding fails, it will raise an exception, which can be handled by the caller of the method.
