The bug in the `from_content_disposition` method occurs because the `to_native_str` function in the `from_content_disposition` method of the `ResponseTypes` class tries to decode the `content_disposition` byte string assuming it is in UTF-8 encoding, which may not always be the case.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the decoding of `content_disposition` byte string in a more robust manner. One possible approach is to use the `email` module from the Python standard library to parse the Content-Disposition header, which will handle the decoding and parsing in a more reliable way.

Here's the corrected code for the `from_content_disposition` method:

```python
import email

class ResponseTypes(object):
    # ... other code ...

    def from_content_disposition(self, content_disposition):
        try:
            _, params = email.header.decode_header(content_disposition)[0]
            filename = params['filename']
            return self.from_filename(filename)
        except IndexError:
            return Response
```

In this corrected code, we use the `email.header.decode_header` function to decode the Content-Disposition header and extract the filename. This method can handle various encodings and special characters in the filename more reliably.

With this correction, the `from_content_disposition` method should be able to handle different encoding types and special characters in the Content-Disposition header without raising a UnicodeDecodeError.
