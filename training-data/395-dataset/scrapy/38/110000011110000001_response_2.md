The test case `test_from_response_clickdata_does_not_ignore_image` is asserting that the form data should contain both `i1` and `i2` fields. However, the `_get_clickable` function is not capturing the `input` tag with type `image` as a clickable element, so it is not returning the expected form data.

The potential error location is within the part of the `_get_clickable` function that determines the clickable elements in the form.

The reason behind this bug is that the `_get_clickable` function only considers `input` and `button` tags of type `submit` as clickable elements, and it does not include `input` tags with type `image`. As a result, it is not able to capture the `i2` field from the test case form.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_get_clickable` function to include `input` tags with type `image` as clickable elements.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_clickable` function:

```python
def _get_clickable(clickdata, form):
    clickables = [
        el for el in form.xpath(
            'descendant::*[(self::input or self::button or self::input[@type="image"])'
            ' and re:test(@type, "^submit$", "i")]'
            '|descendant::button[not(@type)]',
            namespaces={"re": "http://exslt.org/regular-expressions"})
    ]
    if not clickables:
        return

    # If we don't have clickdata, we just use the first clickable element
    if clickdata is None:
        el = clickables[0]
        return (el.get('name'), el.get('value') or '')

    # If clickdata is given, we compare it to the clickable elements to find a
    # match. We first look to see if the number is specified in clickdata,
    # because that uniquely identifies the element
    nr = clickdata.get('nr', None)
    if nr is not None:
        try:
            el = list(form.inputs)[nr]
        except IndexError:
            pass
        else:
            return (el.get('name'), el.get('value') or '')

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...
```

By including `input` tags with type `image` in the list comprehension that identifies clickable elements, the function will now capture the `i2` field from the test case form, and the test case will pass as expected.
