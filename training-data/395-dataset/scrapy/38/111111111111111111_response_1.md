The test case "test_from_response_clickdata_does_not_ignore_image" is failing with an AssertionError. The expected result is {b'i1': [b'i1v'], b'i2': [b'i2v']} but the actual result is {b'i1': [b'i1v']}. This indicates that the "i2" input is being ignored, which is the input with type='image'.

The potential error location is within the "_get_clickable" function, specifically in the logic that identifies clickable elements. It seems that the logic is not properly identifying input elements with type='image'.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the current logic for identifying clickable elements does not account for input elements with type='image'. As a result, these elements are being ignored, leading to the test failure.

To fix the bug, the logic for identifying clickable elements should be updated to include input elements with type='image' in addition to input and button elements with type='submit'.

Here's the corrected code for the "_get_clickable" function:

```python
def _get_clickable(clickdata, form):
    """
    Returns the clickable element specified in clickdata,
    if the latter is given. If not, it returns the first
    clickable element found
    """
    clickables = [
        el for el in form.xpath(
            'descendant::*[(self::input or self::button or self::image)'
            ' and re:test(@type, "^submit|image$", "i")]'
            '|descendant::button[not(@type)]',
            namespaces={"re": "http://exslt.org/regular-expressions"})
    ]
    if not clickables:
        return

    # If we don't have clickdata, we just use the first clickable element
    if clickdata is None:
        el = clickables[0]
        return (el.get('name'), el.get('value') or '')

    # If clickdata is given, we compare it to the clickable elements to find a
    # match. We first look to see if the number is specified in clickdata,
    # because that uniquely identifies the element
    nr = clickdata.get('nr', None)
    if nr is not None:
        try:
            el = list(form.inputs)[nr]
        except IndexError:
            pass
        else:
            return (el.get('name'), el.get('value') or '')

    # We didn't find it, so now we build an XPath expression out of the other
    # arguments, because they can be used as such
    xpath = u'.//*' + \
            u''.join(u'[@%s="%s"]' % c for c in six.iteritems(clickdata))
    el = form.xpath(xpath)
    if len(el) == 1:
        return (el[0].get('name'), el[0].get('value') or '')
    elif len(el) > 1:
        raise ValueError("Multiple elements found (%r) matching the criteria "
                         "in clickdata: %r" % (el, clickdata))
    else:
        raise ValueError('No clickable element matching clickdata: %r' % (clickdata,))
```

With this correction, the "_get_clickable" function should be able to properly identify input elements with type='image' as clickable elements, addressing the issue outlined in the test case and resolving the bug.
