The test case `test_from_response_clickdata_does_not_ignore_image` is trying to test the creation of a request form from a response. It expects the form to contain two inputs, one of type "text" and the other of type "image" with their respective values. However, the test fails because the form only contains the input of type "text".

The potential error lies in the `_get_clickable` function, specifically in the part where it selects clickable elements from the form.

The bug occurs because the function incorrectly selects all elements of type "submit" or "button" as clickable elements, including the image input. This results in the assertion failure in the test case.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the XPath selector in the function to exclude elements of type "image" from the list of clickable elements.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_clickable` function:

```python
def _get_clickable(clickdata, form):
    clickables = [
        el for el in form.xpath(
            'descendant::input[(self::input and not(@type="image"))'
            ' and re:test(@type, "^submit$", "i")]'
            '|descendant::button[not(@type)]',
            namespaces={"re": "http://exslt.org/regular-expressions"})
    ]
    if not clickables:
        return

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By modifying the XPath selector to exclude elements of type "image", we ensure that only clickable elements of type "submit" or "button" (excluding images) are selected, fixing the bug in the function.
