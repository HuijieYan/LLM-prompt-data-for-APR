Based on the error message, the test case is expecting a dictionary containing the values of form fields, but it's only getting the value of the first field 'i1'. This indicates that the _get_clickable function is not selecting the second field 'i2' of the form.

The potential error location within the _get_clickable function is in the part where it collects the clickable elements. It may not be capturing the image input element 'i2' because it doesn't have a type attribute with the value "submit".

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function _get_clickable is not handling all types of clickable elements, such as image inputs, which was unexpected in the test case.

To fix the bug, the _get_clickable function needs to be updated to include handling of image inputs. This can be done by modifying the xpath expression to select all clickable elements, including image inputs. Additionally, it should handle the retrieval of values from these elements.

Here's the corrected code for the _get_clickable function:

```python
def _get_clickable(clickdata, form):
    clickables = [
        el for el in form.xpath('descendant::*[(self::input or self::button or self::img) and re:test(@type, "^(submit|image)$", "i") or @type="button"]',
                                namespaces={"re": "http://exslt.org/regular-expressions"})
    ]

    if not clickables:
        return

    if clickdata is None:
        el = clickables[0]
        return (el.get('name'), el.get('value') or '')

    nr = clickdata.get('nr', None)
    if nr is not None:
        try:
            el = list(form.inputs)[nr]
        except IndexError:
            pass
        else:
            return (el.get('name'), el.get('value') or '')

    xpath = u'.//*' + u''.join(u'[@%s="%s"]' % c for c in six.iteritems(clickdata))
    el = form.xpath(xpath)
    if len(el) == 1:
        return (el[0].get('name'), el[0].get('value') or '')
    elif len(el) > 1:
        raise ValueError("Multiple elements found (%r) matching the criteria in clickdata: %r" % (el, clickdata))
    else:
        raise ValueError('No clickable element matching clickdata: %r' % (clickdata,))
```

With the updated code, the _get_clickable function should now handle image input elements as well as other clickable elements, and the test case error should be resolved.
