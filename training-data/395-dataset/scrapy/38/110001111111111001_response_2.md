The issue lies in the `_get_clickable` function. It is not correctly handling the `<input>` element with `type="image"` in the form.

The test case `test_from_response_clickdata_does_not_ignore_image` is failing because when the form is converted to a dictionary using `_qs` method, it only contains the input field `i1` and its value, but it should also contain the `i2` input field and its value. This is because the `_get_clickable` function is not correctly identifying the `<input>` with `type="image"` as a clickable element.

To fix this, we need to update the `_get_clickable` function to handle the `<input>` with `type="image"` correctly. We can modify the function to include the `<input>` element with `type="image"` in the list of clickables.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_clickable` function:
```python
def _get_clickable(clickdata, form):
    clickables = [
        el for el in form.xpath(
            'descendant::*[(self::input or self::button)'
            ' and re:test(@type, "^submit|image$", "i")]'
            '|descendant::button[not(@type)]',
            namespaces={"re": "http://exslt.org/regular-expressions"})
    ]
    if not clickables:
        return

    # Other logic remains the same
    # ...
```

With this correction, the `_get_clickable` function should correctly identify the `<input>` with `type="image"` as a clickable element, and the test case `test_from_response_clickdata_does_not_ignore_image` should pass without any assertion errors.
