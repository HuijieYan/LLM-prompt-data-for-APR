The test case is checking if the form data returned by the function matches the expected form data. The error message indicates that the function is not returning the expected form data. 

Potential Error Location:
The issue might be with the `_get_clickable` function that is called when `self.request_class.from_response(response)` is executed. This function is responsible for extracting clickable elements from an HTML form.

Reasons Behind the Bug:
The bug might be occurring because the `_get_clickable` function is not correctly identifying and extracting the clickable elements from the HTML form. This could be due to issues with the XPath queries or the logic to extract the elements.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Review and verify the XPath queries used to extract clickable elements from the HTML form.
2. Check the logic for identifying and returning clickable elements, and ensure it covers all possible scenarios.
3. Test the function with different HTML forms and clickdata to understand the behavior and identify the root cause of the issue.

Corrected Code:
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/scrapy_38/scrapy/http/request/form.py

def _get_clickable(clickdata, form):
    clickables = form.xpath(
        'descendant::*[(self::input or self::button) and (@type="submit" or @type="image") or self::button[not(@type)]]'
    )
    if not clickables:
        return

    if clickdata is None:
        el = clickables[0]
        return (el.get('name'), el.get('value') or '')

    nr = clickdata.get('nr', None)
    if nr is not None:
        try:
            el = list(form.inputs)[nr]
            return (el.get('name'), el.get('value') or '')
        except IndexError:
            pass

    xpath_attributes = ''.join('@%s="%s" and ' % c for c in six.iteritems(clickdata))
    xpath = './/*[' + xpath_attributes[:-5] + ']'

    el = form.xpath(xpath)
    if len(el) == 1:
        return (el[0].get('name'), el[0].get('value') or '')
    elif len(el) > 1:
        raise ValueError("Multiple elements found (%r) matching the criteria in clickdata: %r" % (el, clickdata))
    else:
        raise ValueError('No clickable element matching clickdata: %r' % (clickdata,))
```

The corrected code refines the XPath query and optimizes the logic for identifying and returning clickable elements. Additionally, it addresses the comparison of input subtype attributes and handles the scenarios involving image buttons.
