The bug in the provided function is that when clickdata is None, the function is supposed to return the first clickable element, but it doesn't handle that properly. Instead, it should return `None` if there are no clickable elements.

The potential error location is within the block of code where clickdata is None.

The bug occurs because the function is missing a check for the case where clickdata is None. This causes the function to attempt to return the `el` variable even when it's not defined.

To fix the bug, the code needs to be modified to return `None` if there are no clickable elements. This can be done by modifying the condition where clickdata is None.

Here is the corrected code for the `_get_clickable` function:

```python
def _get_clickable(clickdata, form):
    clickables = [el for el in form.xpath(
        'descendant::*[(self::input or self::button) and re:test(@type, "^submit$", "i")]'
        '|descendant::button[not(@type)]',
        namespaces={"re": "http://exslt.org/regular-expressions"})
    ]

    if not clickables:
        return None

    if clickdata is None:
        el = clickables[0]
        return (el.get('name'), el.get('value') or '')

    # Rest of the code remains the same
    ...
```

This modification ensures that if there are no clickable elements, the function will return `None` as expected.
