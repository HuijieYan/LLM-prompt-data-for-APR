The issue seems to be with the handling of image input elements in the `_get_clickable` function. The function is supposed to return a clickable element from a form, but it doesn't currently handle image inputs correctly.

The bug occurs in the part of the function where it tries to get the clickable elements from the form. It uses an XPath expression to find elements of type `input` or `button` with the attribute `type` set to `submit`. However, image inputs are not being accounted for in this XPath expression, which leads to the issue.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the XPath expression to include image inputs as clickable elements. We could update the XPath expression to include image inputs like so:

```python
clickables = [
    el for el in form.xpath(
        'descendant::*[(self::input or self::button or self::image)' 
        ' and re:test(@type, "^submit$", "i")]'
        '|descendant::button[not(@type)]',
        namespaces={"re": "http://exslt.org/regular-expressions"})
    ]
```

By including `self::image` in the XPath expression, we are now accounting for image inputs as clickable elements as well.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_clickable` function:

```python
def _get_clickable(clickdata, form):
    """
    Returns the clickable element specified in clickdata,
    if the latter is given. If not, it returns the first
    clickable element found
    """
    clickables = [
        el for el in form.xpath(
            'descendant::*[(self::input or self::button or self::image)'
            ' and re:test(@type, "^submit$", "i")]'
            '|descendant::button[not(@type)]',
            namespaces={"re": "http://exslt.org/regular-expressions"})
    ]
    if not clickables:
        return

    # If we don't have clickdata, we just use the first clickable element
    if clickdata is None:
        el = clickables[0]
        return (el.get('name'), el.get('value') or '')

    # ... (the rest of the function remains unchanged)
```

By making this change, the function should now correctly handle image input elements as clickable elements.
