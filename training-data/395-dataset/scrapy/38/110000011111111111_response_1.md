Analysis:
The test case provides a form with two input elements, one of type "text" and the other of type "image". The expected result after processing the form is a dictionary containing the values of both input elements.

Error Location:
The issue seems to be in the `_get_clickable` function where the clickables list is being populated with elements using xpath.

Reason for Bug:
The bug seems to be in the logic of populating the clickable elements list. It's failing to include the "image" type input in the clickables list, which results in the incorrect dictionary when the form is processed.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the xpath query to include elements of type "image" in the clickables list.
2. Ensure that the logic for identifying and including clickable elements is correct.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _get_clickable(clickdata, form):
    """
    Returns the clickable element specified in clickdata,
    if the latter is given. If not, it returns the first
    clickable element found
    """
    clickables = [
        el for el in form.xpath(
            'descendant::*[(self::input or self::button or self::image)'  # Include image elements in clickables
            ' and re:test(@type, "^submit$|image$", "i")]'  # Updated to include image type
            '|descendant::button[not(@type)]',
            namespaces={"re": "http://exslt.org/regular-expressions"})
        ]
    if not clickables:
        return

    # If we don't have clickdata, we just use the first clickable element
    if clickdata is None:
        el = clickables[0]
        return (el.get('name'), el.get('value') or '')

    # If clickdata is given, we compare it to the clickable elements to find a
    # match. We first look to see if the number is specified in clickdata,
    # because that uniquely identifies the element
    nr = clickdata.get('nr', None)
    if nr is not None:
        try:
            el = list(form.inputs)[nr]
        except IndexError:
            pass
        else:
            return (el.get('name'), el.get('value') or '')

    # We didn't find it, so now we build an XPath expression out of the other
    # arguments, because they can be used as such
    xpath = u'.//*' + \
            u''.join(u'[@%s="%s"]' % c for c in six.iteritems(clickdata))
    el = form.xpath(xpath)
    if len(el) == 1:
        return (el[0].get('name'), el[0].get('value') or '')
    elif len(el) > 1:
        raise ValueError("Multiple elements found (%r) matching the criteria "
                         "in clickdata: %r" % (el, clickdata))
    else:
        raise ValueError('No clickable element matching clickdata: %r' % (clickdata,))
