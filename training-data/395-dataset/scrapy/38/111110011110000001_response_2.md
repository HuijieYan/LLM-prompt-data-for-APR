The error message shows that the test case is expecting a dictionary with two keys, 'i1' and 'i2', but is only getting a dictionary with one key, 'i1', which is causing the assertion error.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the `_get_clickable` function, specifically in the code that retrieves the clickable elements from the form.

The bug is likely occurring due to the XPath expression used to retrieve clickable elements. It seems that the expression may not be correctly matching the 'input' and 'button' elements. This could result in only one element being found, instead of both 'i1' and 'i2' elements as expected in the test case.

To fix the bug, the XPath expression for retrieving clickable elements should be revised to specifically target 'input' and 'button' elements, without any discrepancies.

The corrected code for the problematic function `_get_clickable`:

```python
def _get_clickable(clickdata, form):
    """
    Returns the clickable element specified in clickdata,
    if the latter is given. If not, it returns the first
    clickable element found
    """
    clickables = form.xpath(
        './/*[self::input[@type="submit"] or self::button[@type="submit"] or self::button[not(@type)]]'
    )
    if not clickables:
        return

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
```

In the corrected code, the XPath expression used to retrieve clickable elements has been updated to specifically target 'input' and 'button' elements with the correct 'type' attribute values as per the HTML form. This should ensure that both 'i1' and 'i2' elements are properly found and returned as clickable elements, resolving the issue observed in the test case.
