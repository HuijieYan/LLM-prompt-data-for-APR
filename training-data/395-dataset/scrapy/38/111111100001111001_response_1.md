The issue seems to be with the `clickables` list not being empty when it should be based on the expected output. 

The potential error in the code is at the line:
```python
el = list(form.inputs)[nr]
```
It seems that the intention is to select the clickable element by index, but this line is not handling the input correctly.

The bug occurs because the code does not properly handle the case when `clickdata` is None. In this case, the code should not return the first clickable element found but should return an empty list.

To fix this issue, you can check if `clickdata` is None and return an empty list in that case. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_clickable(clickdata, form):
    """
    Returns the clickable element specified in clickdata,
    if the latter is given. If not, it returns the first
    clickable element found
    """
    clickables = [
        el for el in form.xpath(
            'descendant::*[(self::input or self::button)'
            ' and re:test(@type, "^submit$", "i")]'
            '|descendant::button[not(@type)]',
            namespaces={"re": "http://exslt.org/regular-expressions"})
        ]
    if clickdata is None:
        return []

    if not clickables:
        return []

    # If we don't have clickdata, we just use the first clickable element
    el = clickables[0]
    return (el.get('name'), el.get('value') or '')

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
```

Now, the function will correctly return an empty list if `clickdata` is None, and the list of clickable elements if `clickdata` is provided.
