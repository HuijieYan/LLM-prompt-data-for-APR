The error occurs in the `_get_clickable` function, specifically in the code that tries to handle input type 'image'. The current implementation does not account for clickable elements of type 'image' and only looks for elements of type 'submit' and buttons.

To fix this bug, you can modify the xpath expression used to find clickable elements to include elements of type 'image' as well. This would allow the function to correctly handle input type 'image' as well.

Below is the corrected code for the `_get_clickable` function:

```python
def _get_clickable(clickdata, form):
    """
    Returns the clickable element specified in clickdata,
    if the latter is given. If not, it returns the first
    clickable element found
    """
    clickables = [
        el for el in form.xpath(
            'descendant::*[(self::input or self::button or self::image)' # added condition for image input
            ' and re:test(@type, "^(submit|image)$", "i")]'  # modified to include image input type
            '|descendant::button[not(@type)]',
            namespaces={"re": "http://exslt.org/regular-expressions"})
        ]
    if not clickables:
        return

    # If we don't have clickdata, we just use the first clickable element
    if clickdata is None:
        el = clickables[0]
        return (el.get('name'), el.get('value') or '')

    # rest of the code remains unchanged...
```

With this modification, the `_get_clickable` function should be able to handle input type 'image' along with 'submit' and buttons when looking for clickable elements.
