The issue seems to be related to the handling of image inputs in the `clickable` elements. The function is not handling the image inputs correctly, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual results.

The potential error location is in the section where the `clickables` list is populated. The function is currently using XPath to select elements with `input` or `button` tags, but it is not specifically handling `input` elements of type `image`.

The bug occurs because the function is not accounting for `input` elements of type `image` when selecting `clickable` elements. As a result, when an `input` type of `image` is present in the form, it is not being included in the `clickables` list.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to include `input` elements of type `image` in the `clickables` list. This can be achieved by modifying the XPath expression to include `input` elements of type `image`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_clickable(clickdata, form):
    clickables = [
        el for el in form.xpath(
            'descendant::*[(self::input or self::button)'
            ' and (re:test(@type, "^submit$", "i") or @type="image")]'
            '|descendant::button[not(@type)]',
            namespaces={"re": "http://exslt.org/regular-expressions"})
        ]
    # rest of the code remains unchanged
```
