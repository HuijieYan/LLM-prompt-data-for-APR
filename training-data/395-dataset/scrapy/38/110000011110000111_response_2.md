The test case "test_from_response_clickdata_does_not_ignore_image" is trying to create a FormRequest from a given response and ensure that the resulting form data contains both "i1" and "i2" fields. However, the test is failing because the "i2" field is not present in the form data as expected.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the "_get_clickable" function, specifically in the part where it is trying to extract clickable elements from the form. 

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is not properly including image-type inputs (`<input type="image">`) in the list of clickable elements. This causes the FormRequest creation to ignore the "i2" field in the form data.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the "_get_clickable" function to include image-type inputs in the list of clickable elements.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import re

def _get_clickable(clickdata, form):
    """
    Returns the clickable element specified in clickdata,
    if the latter is given. If not, it returns the first
    clickable element found
    """
    clickables = [
        el for el in form.xpath(
            'descendant::*[(self::input or self::button or self::image)'
            ' and re:test(@type, "^submit$", "i")]'
            '|descendant::button[not(@type)]',
            namespaces={"re": "http://exslt.org/regular-expressions"})
        ]
    if not clickables:
        return

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged...
    # ... (Unchanged code continues below) ...
```

In the corrected code, we have added `self::image` to the XPath expression to include image-type inputs in the list of clickable elements. This modification allows the correct identification of the "i2" field in the form data, fixing the bug.

This fix will address the issue reported in the GitHub bug titled "FormRequest.from_response() clickdata ignores input[type=image]".
