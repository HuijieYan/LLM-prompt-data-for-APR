The bug seems to be related to the retrieval of clickable elements from the form. In the buggy function, it is trying to retrieve clickable elements from the form and return the first one if no clickdata is provided. However, there is no check to ensure that the correct clickable elements are being retrieved.

It seems that the bug is occurring in the section where it tries to retrieve clickable elements from the form based on certain conditions. The if statement `if not clickables:` should be checked to ensure that the correct elements are being captured from the form.

To fix this bug, the correct XPath expression should be used to retrieve the clickable elements from the form based on the specified conditions. Additionally, it should be verified that the correct clickables are being returned from the form.

```python
def _get_clickable(clickdata, form):
    """
    Returns the clickable element specified in clickdata,
    if the latter is given. If not, it returns the first
    clickable element found
    """
    clickables = [
        el for el in form.xpath(
            'descendant::*[(self::input or self::button)'
            ' and re:test(@type, "^submit$", "i") or not(@type)]',
            namespaces={"re": "http://exslt.org/regular-expressions"})
        ]
    if not clickables:
        return

    # If we don't have clickdata, we just use the first clickable element
    if clickdata is None:
        el = clickables[0]
        return (el.get('name'), el.get('value') or '')

    # ... rest of the function remains the same
```
