The potential error in the function is with the XPath expression used to find clickable elements. The function is trying to find clickable elements in an HTML form using XPath, but the expression used to identify these elements is overly complicated and has several potential issues.

The XPath expression being used to find clickable elements is:
```python
'descendant::*[(self::input or self::button)' ' and re:test(@type, "^submit$", "i")]' '|descendant::button[not(@type)]'
```

This expression is trying to find all input and button elements with a type attribute equal to "submit", as well as all button elements without a type attribute. While this approach may work in some cases, it is unnecessarily complex and prone to errors.

A simpler and more robust approach would be to use separate XPath expressions to find input and button elements with a type attribute equal to "submit", as well as all button elements without a type attribute.

Here's the corrected function with a simplified XPath expression:

```python
import six

def _get_clickable(clickdata, form):
    """
    Returns the clickable element specified in clickdata,
    if the latter is given. If not, it returns the first
    clickable element found
    """
    clickables = form.xpath(
        '(descendant::input[@type="submit" or not(@type)] | descendant::button[not(@type)])'
    )
    if not clickables:
        return

    # If we don't have clickdata, we just use the first clickable element
    if clickdata is None:
        el = clickables[0]
        return (el.get('name'), el.get('value') or '')

    # If clickdata is given, we compare it to the clickable elements to find a match
    for el in clickables:
        if all(el.get(k) == v for k, v in six.iteritems(clickdata)):
            return (el.get('name'), el.get('value') or '')

    raise ValueError('No clickable element matching clickdata: %r' % (clickdata,))
```
