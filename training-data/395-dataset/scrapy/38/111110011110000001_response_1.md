This bug seems to be related to the `_get_clickable` function and how it handles the input elements in the form.

The error message indicates that the expected form data `fs` does not match the actual form data returned by the function. Specifically, the actual data only contains one input field (`i1`), while the expected data includes two input fields (`i1` and `i2`).

The issue in the `_get_clickable` function is likely related to how it identifies clickable elements in the form. It uses an XPath expression to find elements of type `input` or `button` with a type attribute of `submit`. It then checks for `button` elements without a type attribute. This logic may not be capturing all clickable elements as intended.

To fix this issue, we can revise the logic for identifying clickable elements in the form. We can use a more explicit XPath expression to target both `input` and `button` elements, regardless of their type attributes. This approach should ensure that all clickable elements are captured.

Additionally, we should consider using a more robust method for creating the `fs` form data to ensure that all form fields are included in the output.

Here's the corrected `_get_clickable` function:

```python
def _get_clickable(clickdata, form):
    """
    Returns the clickable element specified in clickdata,
    if the latter is given. If not, it returns the first
    clickable element found
    """
    clickables = form.xpath('descendant::input[@type="submit"]|descendant::button')
    if not clickables:
        return None

    if clickdata is None:
        el = clickables[0]
        return (el.get('name'), el.get('value') or '')

    # logic for comparing clickdata to clickable elements
    # ...

    return None  # return None if no match is found
```

By using the revised XPath expression, we can capture all clickable elements in the form. Additionally, we can further improve this function to handle the creation of the form data `fs` to ensure that all form fields are included in the output.
