The bug seems to be occurring due to incorrect handling of the `clickdata` parameter and the presence of the `clickables` list. 

The code is trying to handle the situation where `clickdata` is `None`, and in that case, it should return the first clickable element found in the form. However, there is a mistake in this part of the code.

The code to select the first clickable element is returning a list `clickables`, which is not being handled correctly. It should simply return the first element from the `clickables` list when `clickdata` is `None`, instead of returning `(el.get('name'), el.get('value') or '')`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the code as follows:

```python
def _get_clickable(clickdata, form):
    clickables = [
        el for el in form.xpath(
            'descendant::*[(self::input or self::button)'
            ' and re:test(@type, "^submit$", "i")]'
            '|descendant::button[not(@type)]',
            namespaces={"re": "http://exslt.org/regular-expressions"})
        ]
    if not clickables:
        return

    if clickdata is None:
        el = clickables[0]
        return el  # Return the first clickable element

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
    # ...
```

By making this change, the function will correctly return the first clickable element when `clickdata` is `None`, which matches the expected behavior mentioned in the test case.
