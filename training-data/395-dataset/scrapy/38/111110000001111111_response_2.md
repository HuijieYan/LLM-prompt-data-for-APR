The issue seems to be with the `_get_clickable` function where it is not handling the case for image input types correctly. In the given test case, the `form.inputs` is of type `InputGetter`, which suggests that the form contains an image input element. However, in the current implementation, the function is not handling this case properly and returning a list of clickables with the image input element included.

The potential error location is in the list comprehension where it filters the clickable elements based on the type and ignores the image input type. This leads to the incorrect behavior of returning the image input element as clickable.

The reason behind the bug is that the function is not considering the image input type as a clickable element, which is incorrect. Image inputs in forms are also considered clickable elements and should be handled as such.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the list comprehension to include image input types as clickables as well.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_clickable` function:

```python
def _get_clickable(clickdata, form):
    clickables = [
        el for el in form.xpath(
            'descendant::*[(self::input or self::button or self::image)'
            ' and re:test(@type, "^submit$", "i")]'
            '|descendant::button[not(@type)]',
            namespaces={"re": "http://exslt.org/regular-expressions"})
        ]
    if not clickables:
        return

    # rest of the function remains the same...
```

In the corrected code, we have included `self::image` in the XPath expression to include image input types as clickables. This should fix the issue where image inputs were not being considered as clickable elements.
