The error is occurring because the `_get_clickable` function is not handling image inputs correctly. The test function `test_from_response_clickdata_does_not_ignore_image` is failing because the image input 'i2' is being ignored when creating the form request.

The potential error in the function is in the list comprehension while filtering clickable elements. It's not including elements of type 'image' which is causing the image input to be ignored.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the list comprehension part of the `_get_clickable` function to include elements of type 'image'.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def _get_clickable(clickdata, form):
    """
    Returns the clickable element specified in clickdata,
    if the latter is given. If not, it returns the first
    clickable element found
    """
    clickables = [
        el for el in form.xpath(
        'descendant::*[(self::input or self::button)'
        ' and (re:test(@type, "^submit$", "i") or @type="image")]'
        '|descendant::button[not(@type)]',
        namespaces={"re": "http://exslt.org/regular-expressions"})
    ]
    if not clickables:
        return

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this modification, the `_get_clickable` function will handle image inputs correctly, and the test case should pass without errors.
