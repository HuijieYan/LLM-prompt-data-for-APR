The potential error location within the problematic function is in the section that handles the 'clickdata' argument and tries to find the clickable element based on the provided data.

The bug occurs because the function fails to handle the case when the clickable element is an input with type='image'. The current implementation only looks for elements of type 'input' or 'button' with type='submit'.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to handle input elements with type='image' as clickable elements.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_clickable(clickdata, form):
    """
    Returns the clickable element specified in clickdata,
    if the latter is given. If not, it returns the first
    clickable element found
    """
    clickables = [
        el for el in form.xpath(
            'descendant::*[(self::input or self::button or self::image)'  # Added 'self::image' here
            ' and re:test(@type, "^submit$|^image$", "i")]'  # Updated to include 'image' type
            '|descendant::button[not(@type)]',
            namespaces={"re": "http://exslt.org/regular-expressions"})
        ]
    if not clickables:
        return

    # Rest of the function remains the same
```

In the corrected code, the xpath expression is modified to include 'self::image' to handle input elements with type='image' as clickable elements. The regex pattern for type attribute is also updated to include 'image' type in addition to 'submit'. These changes ensure that the function now correctly handles input elements with type='image' as clickable elements.
