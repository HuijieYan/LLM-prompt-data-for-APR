The error occurs in the buggy function `makeMappingArray`. The `test_makeMappingArray` test function is passing three different values for `N` along with the expected `result`. However, the bug lies within the `makeMappingArray` function itself.

The potential error within the buggy function is the calculation of index `ind`. It seems that the calculation of `ind` is not correct, which leads to the incorrect computation of `distance` and `lut`.

The bug occurs because the index `ind` calculated to interpolate the values between `y0` and `y1` based on the values of `x` is not accurate. The index `ind` is used to interpolate `distance` based on the difference between `y0` and `y1`. This leads to incorrect calculation of `lut`.

To fix the bug, the calculation of the `ind` and `distance` needs to be adjusted. The index `ind` should be calculated based on the nearest ceiling and floor values to `xind` and the `distance` calculation should be revised accordingly.

The corrected code for the `makeMappingArray` function is provided below:

```python
import numpy as np

def makeMappingArray(N, data, gamma=1.0):
    if callable(data):
        xind = np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
        lut = np.clip(np.array(data(xind), dtype=float), 0, 1)
        return lut

    try:
        adata = np.array(data)
    except Exception:
        raise TypeError("data must be convertible to an array")
    shape = adata.shape
    if len(shape) != 2 or shape[1] != 3:
        raise ValueError("data must be nx3 format")

    x = adata[:, 0]
    y0 = adata[:, 1]
    y1 = adata[:, 2]

    if x[0] != 0. or x[-1] != 1.0:
        raise ValueError("data mapping points must start with x=0 and end with x=1")
    if (np.diff(x) < 0).any():
        raise ValueError("data mapping points must have x in increasing order")

    lower_indices = np.floor(x * (N - 1)).astype(int)
    upper_indices = np.ceil(x * (N - 1)).astype(int)

    lut = np.zeros(N)
    for i in range(len(upper_indices)):
        lower_value = y1[i]
        upper_value = y0[i]
        if lower_indices[i] < upper_indices[i]:
            lut[lower_indices[i]:upper_indices[i] + 1] = np.linspace(lower_value, upper_value, upper_indices[i] - lower_indices[i] + 1)
        else:
            lut[lower_indices[i]] = lower_value
    return np.clip(lut, 0.0, 1.0)
```

The corrected function uses the `lower_indices` and `upper_indices` to properly interpolate the values between `y0` and `y1` based on the positions of `x` and `N`. This should fix the bug and make the function behave as expected.
