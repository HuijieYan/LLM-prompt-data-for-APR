The error message indicates that there is a mismatch in the shapes of the arrays when comparing the expected result with the actual result. This suggests that the `makeMappingArray` function is not returning the expected result for the given input parameters.

The potential error location within the `makeMappingArray` function could be the calculation and manipulation of the lookup table (`lut`).

The bug occurs because the function is not handling the edge case where `N` is 1 correctly. The function logic assumes the presence of multiple elements in the lookup table (`lut`) when `N` is greater than 1. However, when `N` is 1, the logic breaks down because there is no interpolation or mapping required for a single-element lookup table.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to handle the edge case where `N` is 1 separately. In this case, the function can simply return the initial value of the lookup table without performing any interpolation.

Here is the corrected code for the `makeMappingArray` function that handles the edge case where `N` is 1:

```python
def makeMappingArray(N, data, gamma=1.0):
    if callable(data):
        xind = np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
        lut = np.clip(np.array(data(xind), dtype=float), 0, 1)
        return lut

    try:
        adata = np.array(data)
    except Exception:
        raise TypeError("data must be convertible to an array")
    shape = adata.shape
    if len(shape) != 2 or shape[1] != 3:
        raise ValueError("data must be nx3 format")

    x = adata[:, 0]
    y0 = adata[:, 1]
    y1 = adata[:, 2]

    if N == 1:
        return np.array([y1[0]])

    if x[0] != 0. or x[-1] != 1.0:
        raise ValueError(
            "data mapping points must start with x=0 and end with x=1")
    if (np.diff(x) < 0).any():
        raise ValueError("data mapping points must have x in increasing order")
    
    # rest of the function can remain unchanged for N > 1
    ...
```

With the provided correction, a separate conditional block for handling the case when `N` is 1 is added. If `N` is 1, the function directly returns an array containing the initial value of the lookup table. This ensures that the function correctly handles the edge case without trying to perform unnecessary calculations.
