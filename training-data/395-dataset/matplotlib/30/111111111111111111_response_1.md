The test case expects the function `makeMappingArray` to return specific results for different input values of `N` and `data`. However, the function is not returning the expected results, leading to an assertion error in the test cases.

The potential error location within the `makeMappingArray` function is likely related to the calculation and manipulation of the `lut` array. The calculations involving `x` and `xind` might not be producing the correct results for different values of `N`.

The specific condition `N=1` leads to a wrong result in the `lut` array, causing the test to fail, as seen from the provided error message.

The bug occurs because the computation based on `N=1` causes inconsistent behavior within the function, leading to the wrong result for the `lut` array. This inconsistency causes the assertion error in the test case.

To fix the bug, the computation and generation of the `lut` array need to be reconsidered for the `N=1` case. Additionally, the function needs to be refactored to ensure consistent and correct behavior for all input values of `N`.

Here's the corrected code for the `makeMappingArray` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def makeMappingArray(N, data, gamma=1.0):
    if callable(data):
        xind = np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
        lut = np.clip(np.array(data(xind), dtype=float), 0, 1)
        return lut

    try:
        adata = np.array(data)
    except Exception:
        raise TypeError("data must be convertible to an array")
    shape = adata.shape
    if len(shape) != 2 or shape[1] != 3:
        raise ValueError("data must be nx3 format")

    x = adata[:, 0]
    y0 = adata[:, 1]
    y1 = adata[:, 2]

    if x[0] != 0. or x[-1] != 1.0:
        raise ValueError("data mapping points must start with x=0 and end with x=1")
    if (np.diff(x) < 0).any():
        raise ValueError("data mapping points must have x in increasing order")

    xind = np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
    ind = np.searchsorted(x, xind)[1:-1]

    distance = (xind[1:-1] - x[ind - 1]) / (x[ind] - x[ind - 1])
    lut = np.concatenate([
        [y1[0]],
        distance * (y0[ind] - y1[ind - 1]) + y1[ind - 1],
        [y0[-1]],
    ])
    return np.clip(lut, 0.0, 1.0)
```

By refactoring the computation for the `lut` array and ensuring consistent behavior for different input values of `N`, the corrected function should address the bug and pass the test cases as expected.
