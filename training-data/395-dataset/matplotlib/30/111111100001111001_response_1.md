The current function is producing incorrect outputs in certain cases due to incorrect array slicing and interpolation logic. When the input parameter `N` is less than the number of points in the mapping data, the function is failing to interpolate correctly between the given mapping points, leading to incorrect lookup table generation.

To fix the bug, the slicing and interpolation logic needs to be corrected to handle cases where the number of elements in the lookup table is less than the number of points in the mapping data.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
import numpy as np

def makeMappingArray(N, data, gamma=1.0):
    """Create an *N* -element 1-d lookup table

    *data* represented by a list of x,y0,y1 mapping correspondences.
    Each element in this list represents how a value between 0 and 1
    (inclusive) represented by x is mapped to a corresponding value
    between 0 and 1 (inclusive). The two values of y are to allow
    for discontinuous mapping functions (say as might be found in a
    sawtooth) where y0 represents the value of y for values of x
    <= to that given, and y1 is the value to be used for x > than
    that given). The list must start with x=0, end with x=1, and
    all values of x must be in increasing order. Values between
    the given mapping points are determined by simple linear interpolation.

    Alternatively, data can be a function mapping values between 0 - 1
    to 0 - 1.

    The function returns an array "result" where ``result[x*(N-1)]``
    gives the closest value for values of x between 0 and 1.
    """
    if callable(data):
        xind = np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
        lut = np.clip(np.array(data(xind), dtype=float), 0, 1)
        return lut

    try:
        adata = np.array(data)
    except Exception:
        raise TypeError("data must be convertible to an array")
    shape = adata.shape
    if len(shape) != 2 or shape[1] != 3:
        raise ValueError("data must be nx3 format")

    x = adata[:, 0]
    y0 = adata[:, 1]
    y1 = adata[:, 2]

    if x[0] != 0. or x[-1] != 1.0:
        raise ValueError(
            "data mapping points must start with x=0 and end with x=1")
    if (np.diff(x) < 0).any():
        raise ValueError("data mapping points must have x in increasing order")
    # begin generation of lookup table
    x_normalized = x * (N - 1)
    xind = (N - 1) * np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma

    # Interpolate between given mapping points
    lut = np.interp(xind, x_normalized, y0, y1)
    return np.clip(lut, 0.0, 1.0)
```

In this corrected function, the interpolation logic has been replaced with `np.interp` to handle cases where `N` is less than the number of points in the mapping data. This ensures that correct interpolation is performed between the given mapping points, and the resulting lookup table is confined to values between 0 and 1.
