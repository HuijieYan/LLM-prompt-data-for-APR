The error is likely occurring due to the incorrect output from the `makeMappingArray` function, which is causing the `assert_array_almost_equal` function to raise an assertion error. This is confirmed by the error message, which indicates a mismatch in shapes and values for the arrays being compared.

The bug is likely located within the calculation of the `lut` array. There are potential issues with how the linear interpolation is being performed and how the `lut` array is being constructed.

The bug occurs due to incorrect calculations in the `makeMappingArray` function. Specifically, the interpolation and construction of the `lut` array are not correctly implemented, leading to incorrect values being returned for different values of `N`.

To fix the bug, the linear interpolation and generation of the `lut` array need to be corrected. One approach to fix the bug is to carefully review the interpolation and array construction logic and ensure that it aligns with the expected behavior specified in the documentation for the function.

Here's the corrected code for the `makeMappingArray` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def makeMappingArray(N, data, gamma=1.0):
    if callable(data):
        xind = np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
        lut = np.clip(np.array(data(xind), dtype=float), 0, 1)
        return lut

    try:
        adata = np.array(data)
    except Exception:
        raise TypeError("data must be convertible to an array")
    shape = adata.shape
    if len(shape) != 2 or shape[1] != 3:
        raise ValueError("data must be nx3 format")

    x = adata[:, 0]
    y0 = adata[:, 1]
    y1 = adata[:, 2]

    if x[0] != 0. or x[-1] != 1.0:
        raise ValueError("data mapping points must start with x=0 and end with x=1")
    if (np.diff(x) < 0).any():
        raise ValueError("data mapping points must have x in increasing order")

    xind = (N - 1) * np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
    lut = np.interp(xind, x, y0, y1)  # Perform linear interpolation
    return lut
```

With this corrected code, the `makeMappingArray` function should behave as expected, and the test cases should pass without any assertion errors.
