The error occurs when attempting to create a LinearSegmentedColormap with N=1. The error message suggests that there is an issue with broadcasting input arrays when N=1.

The potential error location within the makeMappingArray function is likely related to the handling of the input when N=1 and the subsequent calculation of the lookup table (lut). It seems that when N=1, the code is not handling the input data and array operations properly.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code is not properly handling the edge case of N=1 for creating the colormap. This edge case is not being properly handled in the calculation of the lookup table.

To fix the bug, the code may need to handle the edge case of N=1 separately to ensure that the input data and array operations are handled properly. This may involve adjusting the calculations for the lookup table and ensuring that the input data is handled correctly when N=1.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def makeMappingArray(N, data, gamma=1.0):
    if callable(data):
        xind = np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
        lut = np.clip(np.array(data(xind), dtype=float), 0, 1)
        return lut
    
    try:
        adata = np.array(data)
    except Exception:
        raise TypeError("data must be convertible to an array")
    shape = adata.shape
    if len(shape) != 2 or shape[1] != 3:
        raise ValueError("data must be nx3 format")

    x = adata[:, 0]
    y0 = adata[:, 1]
    y1 = adata[:, 2]

    if x[0] != 0. or x[-1] != 1.0:
        raise ValueError(
            "data mapping points must start with x=0 and end with x=1")
    if (np.diff(x) < 0).any():
        raise ValueError("data mapping points must have x in increasing order")

    if N == 1:
        # handle edge case for N=1
        return np.array([y0[0]])
    
    # begin generation of lookup table
    x = x * (N - 1)
    xind = (N - 1) * np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
    ind = np.searchsorted(x, xind)[1:-1]

    distance = (xind[1:-1] - x[ind - 1]) / (x[ind] - x[ind - 1])
    lut = np.concatenate([
        [y1[0]],
        distance * (y0[ind] - y1[ind - 1]) + y1[ind - 1],
        [y0[-1]],
    ])
    # ensure that the lut is confined to values between 0 and 1 by clipping it
    return np.clip(lut, 0.0, 1.0)
```

In the corrected code, the edge case for N=1 is handled separately by directly returning the value of y0[0] in an array. This ensures that the input data and array operations are properly handled for the edge case of N=1, avoiding the error.
