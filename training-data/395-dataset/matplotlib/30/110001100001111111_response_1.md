The error in the `makeMappingArray` function is likely due to the calculation of `xind` and the subsequent handling of the loop with `distance`.

The error message "could not broadcast input array from shape (2) into shape (1)" suggests that there is an issue with the array shapes, indicating a mismatch in the dimensions of the arrays being operated on.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to ensure that the shapes of the arrays being operated on are compatible throughout the function. This might involve careful handling of array dimensions and ensuring that array operations are performed with arrays of compatible shapes.

Here's the corrected code for the `makeMappingArray` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def makeMappingArray(N, data, gamma=1.0):
    if callable(data):
        xind = np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
        lut = np.clip(np.array(data(xind), dtype=float), 0, 1)
        return lut

    try:
        adata = np.array(data)
    except Exception:
        raise TypeError("data must be convertible to an array")
    shape = adata.shape
    if len(shape) != 2 or shape[1] != 3:
        raise ValueError("data must be nx3 format")

    x = adata[:, 0]
    y0 = adata[:, 1]
    y1 = adata[:, 2]

    if x[0] != 0. or x[-1] != 1.0:
        raise ValueError(
            "data mapping points must start with x=0 and end with x=1")
    if (np.diff(x) < 0).any():
        raise ValueError("data mapping points must have x in increasing order")

    xind = np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma  # Update xind calculation
    ind = np.searchsorted(x, xind)[1:-1]

    distance = (xind[1:-1] - x[ind - 1]) / (x[ind] - x[ind - 1])
    lut = np.concatenate([
        [y1[0]],
        distance * (y0[ind] - y1[ind - 1]) + y1[ind - 1],
        [y0[-1]],
    ])

    return np.clip(lut, 0.0, 1.0)
```

In this corrected version, the calculation of `xind` has been updated to ensure it uses the correct dimensions and matches the subsequent operations involving `distance`. This should address the issue of shapes mismatch and resolve the error observed in the test cases.
