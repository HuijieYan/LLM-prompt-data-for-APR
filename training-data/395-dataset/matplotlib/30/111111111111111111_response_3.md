The error message indicates that there is an issue with the shape of the arrays being returned by the function, especially when the parameter N is set to 1. This is likely causing the `assert_array_almost_equal` function to fail.

The potential error location within the function is likely in the conditional block for when N is 1. It seems that the function is not handling the case where N is 1 correctly, resulting in the shape mismatch for the arrays being returned.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely due to the implementation of the function not accounting for the edge case when N is 1. The function may not be correctly handling the array operations or assignments when N is 1, leading to the shape mismatch error.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Adding a specific conditional block for when N is 1, with a separate implementation to handle this edge case.
2. Ensuring that the array operations and assignments within the function are able to handle the case when N is 1 without causing shape mismatches.

Here's the corrected code for the `makeMappingArray` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def makeMappingArray(N, data, gamma=1.0):
    if callable(data):
        xind = np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
        lut = np.clip(np.array(data(xind), dtype=float), 0, 1)
        return lut

    try:
        adata = np.array(data)
    except Exception:
        raise TypeError("data must be convertible to an array")
    shape = adata.shape
    if len(shape) != 2 or shape[1] != 3:
        raise ValueError("data must be nx3 format")

    x = adata[:, 0]
    y0 = adata[:, 1]
    y1 = adata[:, 2]

    if x[0] != 0. or x[-1] != 1.0:
        raise ValueError(
            "data mapping points must start with x=0 and end with x=1")
    if (np.diff(x) < 0).any():
        raise ValueError("data mapping points must have x in increasing order")

    if N == 1:
        return np.array([y0[-1]])

    x = x * (N - 1)
    xind = (N - 1) * np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
    ind = np.searchsorted(x, xind)[1:-1]

    distance = (xind[1:-1] - x[ind - 1]) / (x[ind] - x[ind - 1])
    lut = np.concatenate([
        [y1[0]],
        distance * (y0[ind] - y1[ind - 1]) + y1[ind - 1],
        [y0[-1]],
    ])
    return np.clip(lut, 0.0, 1.0)
```

In this corrected code, a specific condition has been added to handle the case when N is 1, returning the value `y0[-1]` directly. This should address the shape mismatch issue when N is 1.
