The error occurs when the function `makeMappingArray` is called with `N=1` as the input parameter. This triggers an error because of mismatches in array shapes, resulting in the `AssertionError` seen in the test function.

The potential error location is within the computation of the `ind` array, where the logic aimed at generating lookup table (`lut`) values causes the shape mismatch for `N=1`.

The bug occurs because the algorithm does not handle the case of `N=1` properly, leading to shape mismatches and incorrect computation of the lookup table. The function assumes that `N` will always be greater than 1, and the computations related to `ind` and `distance` arrays fail when `N=1`.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle the edge case of `N=1` separately. In this case, the function should directly return the value obtained from the data or function provided. This will avoid the need for array computations and will ensure that the function behavior is consistent with the expected output.

Here's the corrected code for the function `makeMappingArray`:

```python
import numpy as np

def makeMappingArray(N, data, gamma=1.0):
    if callable(data):
        xind = np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
        lut = np.clip(np.array(data(xind), dtype=float), 0, 1)
        return lut

    try:
        adata = np.array(data)
    except Exception:
        raise TypeError("data must be convertible to an array")
    shape = adata.shape
    if len(shape) != 2 or shape[1] != 3:
        raise ValueError("data must be nx3 format")

    x = adata[:, 0]
    y0 = adata[:, 1]
    y1 = adata[:, 2]

    if N == 1:  # Handle N=1 separately
        return y0[0]

    if x[0] != 0. or x[-1] != 1.0:
        raise ValueError("data mapping points must start with x=0 and end with x=1")
    if (np.diff(x) < 0).any():
        raise ValueError("data mapping points must have x in increasing order")

    # begin generation of lookup table
    x = x * (N - 1)
    xind = (N - 1) * np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
    ind = np.searchsorted(x, xind)[1:-1]

    distance = (xind[1:-1] - x[ind - 1]) / (x[ind] - x[ind - 1])
    lut = np.concatenate([
        [y1[0]],
        distance * (y0[ind] - y1[ind - 1]) + y1[ind - 1],
        [y0[-1]],
    ])
    # ensure that the lut is confined to values between 0 and 1 by clipping it
    return np.clip(lut, 0.0, 1.0)
```
