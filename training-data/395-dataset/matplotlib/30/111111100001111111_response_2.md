The error message "could not broadcast input array from shape (2) into shape (1)" indicates that there is an issue with the dimensions of the input array. The error is likely occurring in the makeMappingArray function.

Upon analyzing the function and the error, it appears that the issue arises from the handling of the input array when N is set to 1. This causes problems with shape mismatches during the array operations.

To address this issue, the function should have a special case handling when N is 1. It should return a simple array rather than performing array operations that rely on N being greater than 1. Additionally, the function should handle the case where N is less than the length of the input data. This can be done by adjusting the spacing and indices accordingly.

Here's the corrected function for the makeMappingArray:

```python
import numpy as np

def makeMappingArray(N, data, gamma=1.0):
    if N == 1:
        # Special case when N is 1
        if callable(data):
            return np.array([data(0)])
        else:
            adata = np.array(data)
            return np.array([adata[0, 2]])  # Return the first y value as the single element array
    elif callable(data):
        xind = np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
        lut = np.clip(np.array(data(xind), dtype=float), 0, 1)
        return lut
    else:
        try:
            adata = np.array(data)
        except Exception:
            raise TypeError("data must be convertible to an array")
        shape = adata.shape
        if len(shape) != 2 or shape[1] != 3:
            raise ValueError("data must be nx3 format")

        x = adata[:, 0]
        y0 = adata[:, 1]
        y1 = adata[:, 2]

        if x[0] != 0. or x[-1] != 1.0:
            raise ValueError("data mapping points must start with x=0 and end with x=1")
        if (np.diff(x) < 0).any():
            raise ValueError("data mapping points must have x in increasing order")
        
        # begin generation of lookup table
        x = x * (N - 1)
        xind = (N - 1) * np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
        ind = np.searchsorted(x, xind)[1:-1]

        distance = (xind[1:-1] - x[ind - 1]) / (x[ind] - x[ind - 1])
        lut = np.concatenate([
            [y1[0]],
            distance * (y0[ind] - y1[ind - 1]) + y1[ind - 1],
            [y0[-1]],
        ])
        # ensure that the lut is confined to values between 0 and 1 by clipping it
        return np.clip(lut, 0.0, 1.0)
```

This corrected function handles the special cases when N is 1 and adjusts the array operations accordingly. It also maintains the original functionality for N greater than 1.
