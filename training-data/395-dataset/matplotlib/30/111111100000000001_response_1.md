The potential error location within the problematic function is around the following line:
```python
x = x * (N - 1)
```
This line is trying to multiply an array x with (N-1), but the array x might have different lengths based on the input data. This could lead to a mismatch in dimensions and cause an error.

The reason the bug occurs is that the multiplication assumes that x and (N-1) have the same length, which might not be true for all input cases.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that x and (N-1) have the same length. We can achieve this by using numpy's broadcasting feature to perform the multiplication.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def makeMappingArray(N, data, gamma=1.0):
    if callable(data):
        xind = np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
        lut = np.clip(np.array(data(xind), dtype=float), 0, 1)
        return lut

    try:
        adata = np.array(data)
    except Exception:
        raise TypeError("data must be convertible to an array")
    shape = adata.shape
    if len(shape) != 2 or shape[1] != 3:
        raise ValueError("data must be nx3 format")

    x = adata[:, 0]
    y0 = adata[:, 1]
    y1 = adata[:, 2]

    if x[0] != 0. or x[-1] != 1.0:
        raise ValueError(
            "data mapping points must start with x=0 and end with x=1")
    if (np.diff(x) < 0).any():
        raise ValueError("data mapping points must have x in increasing order")
    
    x_scaled = x * (N - 1)  # use broadcasting to ensure x and (N-1) have the same length
    xind = (N - 1) * np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
    ind = np.searchsorted(x_scaled, xind)[1:-1]

    distance = (xind[1:-1] - x_scaled[ind - 1]) / (x_scaled[ind] - x_scaled[ind - 1])
    lut = np.concatenate([
        [y1[0]],
        distance * (y0[ind] - y1[ind - 1]) + y1[ind - 1],
        [y0[-1]],
    ])
    return np.clip(lut, 0.0, 1.0)
```
