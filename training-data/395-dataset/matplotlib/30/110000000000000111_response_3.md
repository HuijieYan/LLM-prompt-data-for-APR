Issue Summary:
The issue occurs when using the LinearSegmentedColormap with N=1, causing a confusing error message in Matplotlib 3.1rc1.

Error Location and Reasons:
The potential error location is within the LinearSegmentedColormap code where the error message "ValueError: could not broadcast input array from shape (2) into shape (1)" is being generated. The error occurs because the code expects an array of shape (1) but receives an array of shape (2).

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the LinearSegmentedColormap code to handle the case where N=1 separately, ensuring that it does not expect an array shape of (1). Instead, it should handle the case where only a single color is being specified.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:
```python
import numpy as np

def makeMappingArray(N, data, gamma=1.0):
    """Create an *N* -element 1-d lookup table"""
    if callable(data):
        xind = np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
        lut = np.clip(np.array(data(xind), dtype=float), 0, 1)
        return lut

    try:
        adata = np.array(data)
    except Exception:
        raise TypeError("data must be convertible to an array")
    shape = adata.shape
    if len(shape) != 2 or shape[1] != 3:
        raise ValueError("data must be nx3 format")

    x = adata[:, 0]
    y0 = adata[:, 1]
    y1 = adata[:, 2]

    if x[0] != 0. or x[-1] != 1.0:
        raise ValueError("data mapping points must start with x=0 and end with x=1")
    if (np.diff(x) < 0).any():
        raise ValueError("data mapping points must have x in increasing order")

    # begin generation of lookup table
    x = x * (N - 1)
    xind = (N - 1) * np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
    ind = np.searchsorted(x, xind)[1:-1]

    distance = (xind[1:-1] - x[ind - 1]) / (x[ind] - x[ind - 1])
    lut = np.concatenate([
        [y1[0]],
        distance * (y0[ind] - y1[ind - 1]) + y1[ind - 1],
        [y0[-1]],
    ])
    # ensure that the lut is confined to values between 0 and 1 by clipping it
    return np.clip(lut, 0.0, 1.0)
```
