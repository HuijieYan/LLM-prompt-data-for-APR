The bug in the code is with the calculation of the 'ind' variable. In the second buggy case, 'ind' is an empty array, which means that no value from the 'x' array falls within the range of 'xind'. This is caused by the mismatch between the input 'N' and the generated 'xind' array.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the length of the 'xind' array matches the value of 'N' provided as input. This can be achieved by calculating the 'xind' array using the 'N' value rather than a predefined length of 'N-1'.

Here's the corrected code for the 'makeMappingArray' function:

```python
import numpy as np

def makeMappingArray(N, data, gamma=1.0):
    if callable(data):
        xind = np.linspace(0, 1, N, endpoint=True) ** gamma
        lut = np.clip(np.array(data(xind), dtype=float), 0, 1)
        return lut

    try:
        adata = np.array(data)
    except Exception:
        raise TypeError("data must be convertible to an array")
    shape = adata.shape
    if len(shape) != 2 or shape[1] != 3:
        raise ValueError("data must be nx3 format")

    x = adata[:, 0]
    y0 = adata[:, 1]
    y1 = adata[:, 2]

    if x[0] != 0. or x[-1] != 1.0:
        raise ValueError("data mapping points must start with x=0 and end with x=1")
    if (np.diff(x) < 0).any():
        raise ValueError("data mapping points must have x in increasing order")

    xind = np.linspace(0, 1, N, endpoint=True) ** gamma
    ind = np.searchsorted(x, xind, side='left')

    distance = (xind - x[ind - 1]) / (x[ind] - x[ind - 1])
    lut = np.clip(distance * (y0[ind] - y1[ind - 1]) + y1[ind - 1], 0.0, 1.0)
    return lut
```

In the corrected code:
- The 'xind' array is calculated using the 'N' value with the 'endpoint=True' parameter to ensure that it includes the value 1.
- The 'ind' array is recalculated based on the 'x' array and the new 'xind' array.
- The distance calculation and lut construction are simplified using the calculated 'ind' array.
