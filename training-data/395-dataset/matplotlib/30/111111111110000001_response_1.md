The test case provides the expected output result for different values of N and data. The error message indicates a mismatch between the shapes of the arrays.

The potential error in the function is likely to be in the line where an array is created to hold the results. The size of the error is attributed to the calculation of `np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma`, which can result in the array having a different size than expected.

The bug occurs because the size of the generated array `xind` within the `if callable(data)` block does not match the expected input size. This causes inconsistency in the shape of the lookup table array `lut`, leading to a shape mismatch error when comparing it with the expected result.

A possible approach to fixing the bug is to calculate the size of `xind` based on the value of `N` and ensure that it matches the expected size. Additionally, it may be necessary to perform data type conversion and handle exceptional cases as per the operation's requirements.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def makeMappingArray(N, data, gamma=1.0):
    if callable(data):
        xind = np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
        lut = np.clip(np.array(data(xind), dtype=float), 0, 1)
        return lut

    try:
        adata = np.array(data)
    except Exception:
        raise TypeError("data must be convertible to an array")
    shape = adata.shape
    if len(shape) != 2 or shape[1] != 3:
        raise ValueError("data must be nx3 format")

    x = adata[:, 0]
    y0 = adata[:, 1]
    y1 = adata[:, 2]

    if x[0] != 0. or x[-1] != 1.0:
        raise ValueError("data mapping points must start with x=0 and end with x=1")
    if (np.diff(x) < 0).any():
        raise ValueError("data mapping points must have x in increasing order")

    # begin generation of lookup table
    xind = np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma 
    ind = (N) * x 
    distance = (xind[1:-1] - x[ind - 1]) / (x[ind] - x[ind - 1])
    lut = np.concatenate([
        [y1[0]],
        distance * (y0[ind - 1] - y1[ind - 1]) + y1[ind - 1],
        [y0[-1]]
    ])
    return np.clip(lut, 0.0, 1.0)
```
