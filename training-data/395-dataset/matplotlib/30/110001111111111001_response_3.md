The test case is using the `assert_array_almost_equal` function to compare the output of the `makeMappingArray` function with the expected result. The error message indicates that the arrays are not almost equal to 6 decimals and there is a shape mismatch between the arrays.

The potential error location within the `makeMappingArray` function appears to be the calculation of the `xind` variable inside the `if callable(data):` block. This is because the shape of the input data is being used to calculate `xind`, and the rest of the function relies on this variable to be of the correct shape.

The occurrence of the bug is due to the calculation of `xind` inside the `if callable(data):` block. The `xind` variable should have the same shape as `lut` based on the way it's being used in the subsequent parts of the function. Since `xind` needs to be used as an index in the `lut` array, its shape needs to be `(N,)`.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to ensure that `xind` has the correct shape `(N,)` by using `np.linspace(0, 1, N, endpoint=True) ** gamma` instead of `np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def makeMappingArray(N, data, gamma=1.0):
    if callable(data):
        xind = np.linspace(0, 1, N, endpoint=True) ** gamma
        lut = np.clip(np.array(data(xind), dtype=float), 0, 1)
        return lut

    try:
        adata = np.array(data)
    except Exception:
        raise TypeError("data must be convertible to an array")
    shape = adata.shape
    if len(shape) != 2 or shape[1] != 3:
        raise ValueError("data must be nx3 format")

    x = adata[:, 0]
    y0 = adata[:, 1]
    y1 = adata[:, 2]

    if x[0] != 0. or x[-1] != 1.0:
        raise ValueError(
            "data mapping points must start with x=0 and end with x=1")
    if (np.diff(x) < 0).any():
        raise ValueError("data mapping points must have x in increasing order")
    # begin generation of lookup table
    x = x * (N - 1)
    xind = np.linspace(0, 1, N, endpoint=True) ** gamma
    ind = np.searchsorted(x, xind)[1:-1]

    distance = (xind[1:-1] - x[ind - 1]) / (x[ind] - x[ind - 1])
    lut = np.concatenate([
        [y1[0]],
        distance * (y0[ind] - y1[ind - 1]) + y1[ind - 1],
        [y0[-1]],
    ])
    # ensure that the lut is confined to values between 0 and 1 by clipping it
    return np.clip(lut, 0.0, 1.0)
```
