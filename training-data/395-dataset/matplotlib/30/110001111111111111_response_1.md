The error message indicates that there is a shape mismatch when the function `test_makeMappingArray` is called with N=1. The error occurs when the `lut` array is returned with a shape of (1,) instead of the expected shape. This causes a shape mismatch between the `lut` array and the `result` array in the test function.

The potential error location within the `makeMappingArray` function is likely in the calculation of the `lut` array when N=1. 

The bug occurs when N=1 because the computation of the `lut` array is incorrect for this edge case. The function does not handle the case where N=1 properly, resulting in the shape mismatch and causing the test to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to add a condition to handle the case when N=1 separately. Additionally, we can modify the interpolation logic for the `lut` array to ensure that it is computed correctly for N=1.

Below is the corrected code for the `makeMappingArray` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def makeMappingArray(N, data, gamma=1.0):
    if callable(data):
        xind = np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
        lut = np.clip(np.array(data(xind), dtype=float), 0, 1)
        return lut

    try:
        adata = np.array(data)
    except Exception:
        raise TypeError("data must be convertible to an array")
    shape = adata.shape
    if len(shape) != 2 or shape[1] != 3:
        raise ValueError("data must be nx3 format")

    x = adata[:, 0]
    y0 = adata[:, 1]
    y1 = adata[:, 2]

    if x[0] != 0. or x[-1] != 1.0:
        raise ValueError(
            "data mapping points must start with x=0 and end with x=1")
    if (np.diff(x) < 0).any():
        raise ValueError("data mapping points must have x in increasing order")

    if N == 1:
        return np.array([y0[-1]])

    # begin generation of lookup table
    x = x * (N - 1)
    xind = (N - 1) * np.linspace(0, 1, N) ** gamma
    ind = np.searchsorted(x, xind)[1:-1]

    distance = (xind[1:-1] - x[ind - 1]) / (x[ind] - x[ind - 1])
    lut = np.concatenate([
        [y1[0]],
        distance * (y0[ind] - y1[ind - 1]) + y1[ind - 1],
        [y0[-1]],
    ])
    # ensure that the lut is confined to values between 0 and 1 by clipping it
    return np.clip(lut, 0.0, 1.0)
```

With the above fix, the function checks if N is 1 and directly returns the appropriate value instead of performing the interpolation steps. This ensures that the `lut` array has the correct shape and content when N=1, resolving the shape mismatch issue and allowing the test to pass.
