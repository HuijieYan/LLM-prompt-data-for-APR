The error in the test case is due to the fact that the STOP code is being appended to the path, which causes the rest of the path to be dropped silently. This leads to unexpected results when checking the number of STOP codes in the path.

The potential error location within the `make_compound_path` function is where the "STOP" code is being handled.

The bug occurs because the `make_compound_path` function is not correctly handling the `STOP` code. It is appending unnecessary `STOP` codes to the path, which causes unexpected behavior in the `test_make_compound_path_stops` test case.

To fix the bug, the `make_compound_path` function should be modified to handle the `STOP` code properly and avoid unnecessarily appending `STOP` codes to the path.

Here's the corrected code for the `make_compound_path` function:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
    codes = np.concatenate([x.codes for x in args])
    
    return cls(vertices, codes)
```

This corrected code removes the unnecessary handling of `STOP` codes and correctly concatenates the vertices and codes from the input paths to create the compound path.
