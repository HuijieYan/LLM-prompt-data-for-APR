The error occurs because the `make_compound_path` function is not handling the input Path objects correctly, leading to incorrect concatenation of vertices and codes.

The bug is occurring in the for loop iteration where the codes for each path are not being set correctly. The code attempts to set the codes for each path, but it doesn't consider the increment in the index `i` when setting the codes.

To fix the bug, the for loop should be modified to correctly set the codes for each path and increment the index `i` accordingly.

Here's the corrected function for `make_compound_path`:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    # Concatenate vertices
    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])

    # Initialize empty codes array
    codes = np.empty(len(vertices), dtype=np.uint8)

    i = 0
    for path in args:
        if path.codes is None:
            codes[i] = cls.MOVETO
            codes[i + 1:i + len(path.vertices)] = cls.LINETO
        else:
            codes[i:i + len(path.codes)] = path.codes
        i += len(path.vertices)

    return Path(vertices, codes)
```

With this correction, the function should correctly concatenate the vertices and set the codes for each Path object, addressing the bug that caused the test failure.
