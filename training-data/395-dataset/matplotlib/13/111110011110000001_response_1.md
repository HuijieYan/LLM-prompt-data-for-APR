The test case `test_make_compound_path_stops` creates an array `paths` consisting of three Path objects, each with two vertices and two codes (MOVETO, STOP). The `make_compound_path` method is then called with these paths, and it should create a compound path from these individual paths.

The error message indicates that the assertion `np.sum(compound_path.codes == Path.STOP) == 1` has failed. It is expecting one occurrence of `Path.STOP` code in the `compound_path`, but it found 3.

The potential error location in the `make_compound_path` method is likely in the loop where it calculates the `codes` array by concatenating the codes from individual paths.

The bug is occurring because the code to handle the `STOP` type in the `make_compound_path` method is incorrect. The method doesn't handle the STOP code correctly while concatenating paths.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the loop that concatenates the paths and their codes. When encountering a `STOP` code in an individual path, the method should add it directly to the new `codes` array instead of converting it to `MOVETO` and then `LINETO`.

Here's the corrected code for the `make_compound_path` method:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
    total_codes_length = sum(len(x.codes) if x.codes is not None else 2 for x in args)  # For handling STOP codes
    codes = np.empty(total_codes_length, dtype=cls.code_type)
    i = 0
    for path in args:
        if path.codes is None:
            codes[i] = cls.MOVETO
            codes[i + 1] = cls.LINETO
            i += 2
        else:
            codes[i:i + len(path.codes)] = path.codes
            i += len(path.codes)

    return cls(vertices, codes)
```

This corrected code accounts for the STOP code in individual paths and correctly concatenates the codes from each path into the new `codes` array.
