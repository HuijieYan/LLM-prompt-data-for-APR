The bug occurs in the `make_compound_path` method of the `Path` class. It is concatenating the vertices and codes of the `Path` objects passed in the `args` tuple incorrectly, resulting in incorrect values for vertices and codes.

The bug occurs because the `i` index is used incorrectly in the loop, and the logic for assigning codes to the concatenated array is incorrect. Additionally, the `len(path.vertices)` should be `len(path.codes)` when `path.codes` is not None.

To fix the bug, the logic for concatenating vertices and codes should be revised to iterate over the paths and properly concatenate the vertices and codes based on their lengths.

Here's the corrected code for the `make_compound_path` method:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
    codes = np.concatenate([x.codes if x.codes is not None else np.array([cls.MOVETO] + [cls.LINETO] * (len(x.vertices) - 1), dtype=np.uint8) for x in args])

    return cls(vertices, codes)
```

This corrected code appropriately concatenates the vertices and codes based on the length of each `Path` object. This should address the bug and ensure that the concatenated vertices and codes are correctly constructed.
