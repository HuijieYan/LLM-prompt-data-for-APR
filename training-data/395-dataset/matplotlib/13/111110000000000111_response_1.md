The potential error location within the `make_compound_path` function is in the for loop where the `codes` array is being populated.

The error occurs because there is an issue in the logic for populating the `codes` array. Specifically, when `path.codes` is None, the logic for populating the `codes` array with `MOVETO` and `LINETO` codes is incorrect.

To fix the bug, we can update the logic for populating the `codes` array when `path.codes` is None. We can replace the incorrect logic with a loop that correctly populates the `codes` array with `MOVETO` and `LINETO` codes based on the length of `path.vertices`.

Here's the corrected code for the `make_compound_path` function:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])

    num_vertices = sum(len(path.vertices) for path in args)
    codes = np.zeros(num_vertices, dtype=cls.code_type)

    index = 0
    for path in args:
        if path.codes is None:
            codes[index] = cls.MOVETO
            codes[index + 1:index + len(path.vertices)] = cls.LINETO
        else:
            codes[index:index + len(path.codes)] = path.codes
        index += len(path.vertices)

    return cls(vertices, codes)
```
