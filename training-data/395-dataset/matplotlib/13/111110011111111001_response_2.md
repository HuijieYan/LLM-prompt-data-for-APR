The test fails because the expected value of `compound_path.codes` does not match the actual value. This indicates that the `make_compound_path` function has a bug.

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `codes` array when `path.codes` is None. The `codes` array is being populated incorrectly in such cases.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic for populating the `codes` array when `path.codes` is None. We also need to update the calculation of the index `i` to ensure that the `codes` array is filled correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `make_compound_path` function:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
    
    # Create an empty list to store codes
    codes = []
    
    i = 0
    for path in args:
        if path.codes is None:
            # If path.codes is None, populate with MOVETO and LINETO codes
            n = len(path.vertices)
            # Append MOVETO code
            codes.append(cls.MOVETO)
            # Append LINETO code for each vertex after the first one
            for _ in range(n - 1):
                codes.append(cls.LINETO)
        else:
            # If path.codes is not None, simply append to the codes list
            codes.extend(path.codes)

    # Convert the codes list to a numpy array
    codes = np.array(codes, dtype=cls.code_type)

    return cls(vertices, codes)
```

With this correction, the `make_compound_path` function should populate the `codes` array correctly, and the test case should pass.
