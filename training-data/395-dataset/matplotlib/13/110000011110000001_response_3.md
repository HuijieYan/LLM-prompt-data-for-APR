The test case calls the `make_compound_path` method with three `Path` objects, each having a single point and a single code (MOVETO, STOP). The assertion checks if the count of STOP codes in the compound path is 1.

The error message shows that the assertion failed because the count of STOP codes in the compound path is 3 instead of 1.

Upon closer inspection, it seems that the bug is in the section of code that assigns the path codes to the compound path. The issue arises from how it handles the case when `path.codes` is None.

The bug occurs because when `path.codes` is None, it incorrectly tries to set the codes for MOVETO and LINETO but does not handle the STOP code.

To fix this bug, a possible approach would be to update the logic for handling None `path.codes` to correctly account for the STOP code. Additionally, the code for appending MOVETO and LINETO codes should be checked for correctness.

The corrected code for the `make_compound_path` method is provided below:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
    codes = np.empty(len(vertices), dtype=cls.code_type)
    i = 0
    for path in args:
        if path.codes is None:
            codes[i] = cls.MOVETO
            # Set the last element of codes as STOP code
            codes[i + len(path.vertices) - 1] = cls.STOP
            if len(path.vertices) > 1:
                # Set the intermediate codes as LINETO
                codes[i + 1: i + len(path.vertices)] = cls.LINETO
        else:
            # Copy the codes from the path to the compound path
            codes[i:i + len(path.codes)] = path.codes
        i += len(path.vertices)

    return cls(vertices, codes)
```
