The error message indicates that the assert statement in the test function is failing because the sum of `compound_path.codes == Path.STOP` is not equal to 1 as expected.

The potential error in the `make_compound_path` method is in the for loop where the `codes` array is being populated based on the input `args`. It seems that the logic for handling `Path.STOP` is incorrect, which is causing the failure in the test case.

The reason for the bug is that the handling of the `Path.STOP` code inside the for loop is not properly implemented. This is causing the `compound_path.codes` array to contain incorrect values.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to correctly handle the `Path.STOP` code within the for loop. This would involve checking for `Path.STOP` and ensuring that the subsequent codes are not appended to the `codes` array.

Here's the corrected code for the `make_compound_path` method:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
    codes = np.empty(len(vertices), dtype=cls.code_type)
    i = 0
    for path in args:
        if path.codes is None:
            codes[i] = cls.MOVETO
            codes[i + 1:i + len(path.vertices)] = cls.LINETO
            i += len(path.vertices)
        else:
            if path.codes[-1] == cls.STOP:
                codes[i:i + len(path.codes)-1] = path.codes[:-1]
                i += len(path.codes) - 1
            else:
                codes[i:i + len(path.codes)] = path.codes
                i += len(path.vertices)

    return cls(vertices, codes)
```

In the corrected code, I added a check for `Path.STOP` inside the for loop and handled it to ensure that `STOP` does not get appended to the `codes` array. This should resolve the issue and make the test case pass.
