The issue with the `make_compound_path` function is with the logic for concatenating the vertices from multiple `Path` objects. It seems that the code is not correctly handling `MOVETO` and `LINETO` codes when concatenating the vertices and codes arrays.

The function incorrectly calculates the indices to update `codes` for each `Path` object, leading to wrong values being assigned to the `codes` array. Additionally, the concatenation of `vertices` is incorrect, leading to an incorrect final array.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the concatenation of `vertices` and `codes`, as well as updating the `i` index to assign correct values to `codes`.

Here's the corrected code for the `make_compound_path` function:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    all_vertices = []
    all_codes = []
    i = 0
    for path in args:
        if path.codes is not None:
            all_codes.append(path.codes)
            all_vertices.append(path.vertices)
            i += len(path.vertices)
        else:
            all_codes.append(np.array([cls.MOVETO] + [cls.LINETO] * (len(path.vertices) - 1), dtype=cls.code_type))
            all_vertices.append(path.vertices)
            i += len(path.vertices)

    vertices = np.concatenate(all_vertices)
    codes = np.concatenate(all_codes)

    return cls(vertices, codes)
```
