The issue in the provided code is that there are two different function signatures for `vertices` and `codes`, but only one of each should exist.

Reason for the bug:
- The `make_compound_path` function tries to concatenate the `vertices` and `codes` arrays from multiple `Path` objects using `np.concatenate`, but it does not handle the `codes` array correctly when the `codes` of a `Path` object is None.

Possible approach to fixing the bug:
- Define only one `vertices` and `codes` function in the `Path` class, and remove the second definitions for each. Then make sure to handle the case where the `codes` of a `Path` object is None when concatenating the arrays in the `make_compound_path` function.

Here is the corrected code for the `make_compound_path` function:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))
    
    vertices_list = [x.vertices for x in args]
    vertices = np.concatenate(vertices_list)
    
    codes_list = [path.codes if path.codes is not None else np.full(len(path.vertices), cls.LINETO, dtype=cls.code_type) for path in args]
    codes = np.concatenate(codes_list)
    
    return cls(vertices, codes)
```

In the corrected code, we first create separate lists for `vertices` and `codes` from the input `Path` objects. Then we concatenate these lists to create the `vertices` and `codes` arrays for the new `Path` object. If the `codes` of a `Path` object is None, we fill it with `LINETO` code. This way, the `make_compound_path` function handles the concatenation of `vertices` and `codes` arrays correctly.
