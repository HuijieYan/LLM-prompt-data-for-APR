The error in the `make_compound_path` method is likely in the loop that populates the `codes` array. The indices used to populate the `codes` array are likely incorrect, leading to the mismatch in the expected and actual results.

The bug occurs because the indices for populating the `codes` array are not calculated correctly. The loop does not account for the correct starting index for each path's vertices and codes.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to correctly calculate the starting index for each path's vertices and codes when populating the `codes` array. This can be achieved by keeping track of the cumulative length of vertices and codes as the loop iterates through the paths.

Here's the corrected `make_compound_path` method:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))
    
    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
    codes = np.empty(len(vertices), dtype=cls.code_type)
    
    vertices_index = 0
    codes_index = 0
    
    for path in args:
        if path.codes is None:
            codes[codes_index] = cls.MOVETO
            codes_index += 1
            codes[codes_index:codes_index + len(path.vertices) - 1] = cls.LINETO
            codes_index += len(path.vertices) - 1
        else:
            codes[codes_index:codes_index + len(path.codes)] = path.codes
            codes_index += len(path.codes)
        
        vertices_index += len(path.vertices)

    return cls(vertices, codes)
```

This corrected code addresses the issue by correctly tracking the indices for populating the `codes` array, ensuring that the vertices and codes are aligned correctly.

After applying this correction, the test case `test_make_compound_path_stops` should pass without any assertion errors.
