Potential error location: The issue seems to be related to the `make_compound_path` method in the `path.py` file. It appears that the method is not correctly handling the creation of vertices and codes for the compound path.

Reasons behind the bug:
1. The `make_compound_path` method is not correctly concatenating the vertices from the input `Path` objects.
2. The logic for assigning codes to the concatenated vertices is not handling the case where `path.codes` is None.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
1. Concatenate the vertices from the input `Path` objects properly.
2. Modify the logic for assigning codes to handle the case where `path.codes` is None.

The corrected code for the `make_compound_path` method is as follows:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices_list = [x.vertices for x in args]
    vertices = np.concatenate(vertices_list)  # Concatenate vertices properly
    codes = np.empty(len(vertices), dtype=cls.code_type)
    i = 0
    for path in args:
        if path.codes is None:
            codes[i] = cls.MOVETO
            codes[i + 1:i + len(path.vertices)] = cls.LINETO
        else:
            if len(path.codes) > 0:  # Handle the case where path.codes is None
                codes[i:i + len(path.codes)] = path.codes
            else:
                codes[i:i + len(path.vertices)] = cls.LINETO  # Assign LINETO codes if path.codes is None
        i += len(path.vertices)

    return cls(vertices, codes)
```

This corrected code properly concatenates the vertices and handles the assignment of codes for the compound path.
