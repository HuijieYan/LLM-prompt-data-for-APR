The error message is indicating that the assertion `assert np.sum(compound_path.codes == Path.STOP) == 1` is failing. The expected result is 1, but the actual result is 3.

The potential error location is in the `make_compound_path` method, where the `codes` for the compound path are being generated.

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `codes` array in the `make_compound_path` method. The current approach does not properly assign the `codes` of each individual path to the combined array.

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic for combining the `codes` arrays of individual paths by accounting for their lengths and correctly setting the `MOVETO` and `LINETO` codes. 

Here's the corrected code for the `make_compound_path` method:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])

    codes = []
    for path in args:
        if path.codes is None:
            codes.extend([cls.MOVETO] + [cls.LINETO] * (len(path.vertices) - 1))
        else:
            codes.extend(path.codes)

    return cls(vertices, np.array(codes, dtype=cls.code_type))
```

With this update, the `codes` array is correctly generated by accounting for the lengths of individual paths and setting the appropriate `MOVETO` and `LINETO` codes. This should resolve the bug and make the test case pass.
