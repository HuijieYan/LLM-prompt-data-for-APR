The bug in the provided function is likely caused by the incorrect handling of the `STOP` code in the `make_compound_path` method. The error message from the test function indicates that the comparison `np.sum(compound_path.codes == Path.STOP) == 1` is failing, which means the `STOP` code is not being handled correctly.

Upon examining the code, it appears that the `STOP` code is not being properly accounted for in the `make_compound_path` method. This is causing the concatenated path to be dropped silently when the `STOP` code is encountered.

To fix this bug, the handling of the `STOP` code needs to be revised in the `make_compound_path` method to ensure that it is not causing the rest of the concatenated path to be dropped.

Here's the corrected code for the `make_compound_path` method:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices_list = [path.vertices for path in args]
    codes_list = [path.codes for path in args]

    vertices = np.concatenate(vertices_list)
    codes = np.concatenate(codes_list)

    return Path(vertices, codes)
```

By revising the function to concatenate the vertices and codes from the list of `Path` objects directly, the bug related to the mishandling of the `STOP` code should be resolved.
