The provided test `test_make_compound_path_stops` attempts to create a compound path from a list of three `Path` objects, each representing a line drawn between two points. The `assert` statement then verifies that the sum of occurrences of `Path.STOP` within the `codes` of the `compound_path` is equal to 1.

The error message indicates that the `assert` failed because it expected the sum to be 1 but it actually found it to be 3.

The potential error in the problematic function `make_compound_path` is likely in the loop where the `codes` are populated. It appears that the loop index `i` is not correctly incremented within the loop, and this may be causing incorrect placement of `MOVETO` and `LINETO` codes.

The bug seems to occur because the loop that populates the `codes` array does not increment the index `i` correctly. As a result, the codes for the subsequent paths are placed incorrectly in the `codes` array.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to ensure that the loop index `i` is incremented by the correct amount at each iteration, considering the length of the `codes` for each individual path. Additionally, the manipulation of the `codes` array should be done more carefully to avoid overwriting values and to correctly handle the insertion of `MOVETO` and `LINETO` codes when a path's `codes` are None.

Here's the corrected code for the `make_compound_path` function:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    all_vertices = []
    all_codes = []
    for path in args:
        all_vertices.extend(path.vertices)
        if path.codes is None:
            all_codes.append(cls.MOVETO)
            all_codes.extend([cls.LINETO] * (len(path.vertices) - 1))
        else:
            all_codes.extend(path.codes)

    return cls(all_vertices, all_codes)
```

In this corrected code, the loop populates two lists, `all_vertices` and `all_codes`, with all the vertex and code information from the individual paths. It handles the case when a path's `codes` are None by appending `MOVETO` once and `LINETO` for the rest of the vertices. Finally, it uses the concatenated data to create a new `Path` object.
