The error occurs in the `make_compound_path` method which is supposed to concatenate the vertices and codes of multiple paths and return a new compound Path object. In the buggy function, the concatenation of the vertices and codes is not done correctly according to the data structure definition described in the class.

The reason for the bug is that the loop for concatenating the codes does not handle the case where the `path.codes` is `None`. Additionally, the indexing for assigning `codes` is incorrect.

To fix the bug, the function should concatenate the `vertices` and `codes` of all the paths properly, handling the case where `path.codes` is `None`.

Here's the corrected `make_compound_path` method:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return cls(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices = [x.vertices for x in args]
    codes = [x.codes if x.codes is not None else np.array([cls.MOVETO] + [cls.LINETO] * (len(x.vertices)-1), dtype=np.uint8) for x in args]

    concatenated_vertices = np.concatenate(vertices)
    concatenated_codes = np.concatenate(codes)

    return cls(concatenated_vertices, concatenated_codes)
```

This corrected method properly concatenates the `vertices` and `codes` of all the paths while handling the case where `path.codes` is `None`. This should resolve the bug and make the test case pass successfully.
