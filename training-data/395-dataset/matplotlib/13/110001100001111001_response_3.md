The issue in the 'make_compound_path' function arises from the incorrect calculation of 'vertices' and 'codes' arrays. The code doesn't correctly concatenate the vertices of all the given Path objects, and the calculation of the associated codes for these vertices is also incorrect. 

To fix the bug, first, we need to concatenate the vertices of all the given Path objects, and then adjust the codes accordingly to represent the different paths (e.g., MOVETO, LINETO) properly in the 'codes' array.

Here's the corrected code for the 'make_compound_path' function:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects.""" 
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))
    
    all_vertices = [x.vertices for x in args]
    vertices = np.concatenate(all_vertices)

    i = 0
    codes = []
    for path in args:
        path_length = len(path.vertices)
        if path_length > 0:
            codes.extend([cls.MOVETO] + [cls.LINETO] * (path_length - 1))
    
    return cls(vertices, codes)
```
