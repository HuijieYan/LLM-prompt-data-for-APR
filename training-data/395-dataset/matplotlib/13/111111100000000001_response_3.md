The potential error location within the `make_compound_path` function is the concatenation of vertices from the input `args` without taking into account the relative starting position of each path, causing the vertices and codes to be concatenated incorrectly.

To fix the bug, the starting index for each path's vertices and codes needs to be tracked and updated properly as the concatenation occurs.

Here's the corrected code for the `make_compound_path` function:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))
    
    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
    codes = np.concatenate([x.codes for x in args])
    
    # Update the code types based on the length of the vertices
    for i, path in enumerate(args):
        if path.codes is None:
            codes[i] = cls.MOVETO
            codes[i + 1:i + len(path.vertices)] = cls.LINETO
        else:
            codes[i:i + len(path.codes)] = path.codes
            
    return cls(vertices, codes)
```
