The error occurs because the `make_compound_path` function is not correctly concatenating the vertices and codes of the input paths. It also erroneously sets all the codes to `MOVETO` and `LINETO` instead of handling the individual path codes.

To fix the bug, the `make_compound_path` function needs to concatenate the vertices and codes of the input paths while correctly handling the path codes.

Here's the corrected code for the `make_compound_path` function:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices_list = [x.vertices for x in args]
    codes_list = [x.codes for x in args]
    total_vertices = np.concatenate(vertices_list)
    total_codes = np.concatenate(codes_list)

    return cls(total_vertices, total_codes)
```

The updated code correctly concatenates the vertices and codes of the input paths and returns a new `Path` object with the combined vertices and codes.

This fix should address the concatenation issue and properly handle the individual path codes, ensuring that the test case `test_make_compound_path_stops` passes without errors.
