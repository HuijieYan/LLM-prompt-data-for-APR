The test case is attempting to verify that the sum of the elements in `compound_path.codes` array that are equal to `Path.STOP` is 1. However, the test fails with an assertion error, indicating that the sum is actually 3 instead of 1.

The potential error is within the `make_compound_path` method. Upon concatenating the vertices and initializing the `codes` array, the subsequent loop for assigning the correct codes to the concatenated paths appears to be incorrect.

The reason behind this bug is that the indices for the code assignment are not incremented correctly within the loop, and the way the `codes` array is being filled is not aligned with the logic of the Path objects.

An approach to fix this bug would be to maintain separate counters for the code assignment and vertex concatenation. Then, for each path, the respective code values should be assigned appropriately to the `codes` array. 

Below is the corrected code for the `make_compound_path` method:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
    codes = np.concatenate([x.codes if x.codes is not None else [cls.MOVETO, cls.LINETO] * (len(x.vertices) - 1) for x in args])

    return cls(vertices, codes)
```

By using `np.concatenate` for the `codes` array and including appropriate logic for the code values, the function should now correctly assign the codes to the compound path.

With the corrected function, the test case should now pass.
