The potential error in the given function is that the `make_compound_path` method is missing the `cls` parameter to represent the class itself, and it's missing the `code_type` attribute.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function is trying to access `cls.code_type` without having `code_type` as a class attribute, and it's not using the `cls` parameter to access class attributes and methods.

To fix this, you can add `cls` as a parameter to the `make_compound_path` method to represent the class itself, and use `cls` to access class attributes and methods. Additionally, define the `code_type` attribute in the class.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class MyClass:
    code_type = np.uint8  # Define the code_type attribute

    @classmethod
    def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
        """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
        # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
        if not args:
            return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

        vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
        codes = np.empty(len(vertices), dtype=cls.code_type)
        i = 0
        for path in args:
            if path.codes is None:
                codes[i] = cls.MOVETO
                codes[i + 1:i + len(path.vertices)] = cls.LINETO
            else:
                codes[i:i + len(path.codes)] = path.codes
            i += len(path.vertices)

        return cls(vertices, codes)
```
