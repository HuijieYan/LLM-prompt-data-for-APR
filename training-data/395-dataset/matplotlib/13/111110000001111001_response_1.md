The bug is due to incorrect indexing and assignment within the `make_compound_path` function. The code is not correctly concatenating vertices and updating codes.

Error location: The bug is occurring in the for loop where the `vertices` and `codes` arrays are being concatenated and updated.

Reasons behind the bug:
1. The loop does not update the `codes` array correctly when the `path.codes` is None.
2. The indexing and concatenation within the loop for vertices and codes are incorrect.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the loop to correctly concatenate vertices and update codes for each path in the `args` list.
2. Use appropriate indexes to concatenate vertices and update codes based on the lengths of the paths.

The corrected code for the `make_compound_path` function:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
    codes = np.concatenate([x.codes for x in args])

    return Path(vertices, codes)
```
