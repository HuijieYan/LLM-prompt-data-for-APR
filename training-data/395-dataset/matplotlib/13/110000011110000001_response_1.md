The test case `test_make_compound_path_stops` creates a compound path from three instances of the `Path` class, each containing two points and a code array with `Path.MOVETO` and `Path.STOP` codes. The test then checks if the number of `Path.STOP` codes in the compound path is 1.

The bug in the `make_compound_path` method seems to be related to how the `codes` array is being constructed. The error message indicates that the expected number of `Path.STOP` codes is 1, but the actual number is 3.

The issue appears to be with how the `codes` array is being concatenated and populated within the for loop. The algorithm for determining the `codes` within the loop needs to be revised to correctly account for the different `codes` arrays within each `Path` object.

To fix the bug, we can revise the method as follows:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
    codes = np.concatenate([x.codes for x in args])

    return cls(vertices, codes)
```

In this corrected version, we concatenate the `vertices` and `codes` arrays from all the `Path` objects in the given list. This ensures that the compound path contains all the vertices and their corresponding codes from the individual `Path` objects.
