The test case defines a list of `Path` objects and calls the `make_compound_path` function with these paths as arguments. Then, it checks if the sum of the `compound_path` codes equal the value of `Path.STOP`.

The error message indicates that the sum of `compound_path` codes does not equal the expected value.

After analyzing the code, it seems that the bug is caused by the incorrect indexing and assignment of codes in the `make_compound_path` function. Specifically, in the loop where the codes are assigned, the starting index for code assignment is incorrect.

To fix the bug, the starting index for code assignment inside the loop needs to be updated to ensure the correct assignment.

Here's the corrected code for the `make_compound_path` function:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
    codes = np.empty(len(vertices), dtype=cls.code_type)
    i = 0
    for path in args:
        if path.codes is None:
            codes[i] = cls.MOVETO
            codes[i + 1:i + len(path.vertices)] = cls.LINETO
        else:
            end_index = i + len(path.codes)
            codes[i:end_index] = path.codes
        i += len(path.vertices)

    return cls(vertices, codes)
```

In this corrected code, the `end_index` variable is used to calculate the end index for code assignment. This will ensure that the correct number of codes are assigned to the `compound_path`.

This should fix the bug and make the `make_compound_path` function work as expected.
