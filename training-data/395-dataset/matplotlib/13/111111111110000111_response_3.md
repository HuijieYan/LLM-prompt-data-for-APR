The test case `test_make_compound_path_stops` is attempting to create a compound path using the `make_compound_path` function and then checking if the sum of `compound_path.codes` is equal to `Path.STOP`.

The error message indicates that the sum of `compound_path.codes` is 3, which is not equal to 1 as expected. This suggests that the `make_compound_path` function is not generating the correct `codes` for the compound path.

The issue lies in the implementation of the `make_compound_path` function. It fails to properly concatenate the `vertices` and `codes` of the individual paths while creating the compound path.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `make_compound_path` function to correctly concatenate the `vertices` and `codes` of the input paths.

Here's the corrected `make_compound_path` function:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))
    
    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
    codes = np.concatenate([x.codes for x in args])
    
    return cls(vertices, codes)
```

In this corrected version, we concatenate the `vertices` and `codes` of the input paths using `np.concatenate` to properly create the compound path.
