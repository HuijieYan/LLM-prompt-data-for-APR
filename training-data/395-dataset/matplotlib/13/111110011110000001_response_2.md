The error occurs when the `test_make_compound_path_stops` function tries to assert that the sum of `compound_path.codes` equal to `Path.STOP` is 1, but it fails as the sum is 3, not 1.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the loop for assigning codes to the compound path. The loop doesn't correctly handle the `MOVETO` and `LINETO` codes, which results in an incorrect sum.

The bug occurs because the iteration over the paths to concatenate vertices and assign codes is not handling the case of `MOVETO` and `LINETO` codes correctly. This leads to incorrect code assignment and the sum not being as expected.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the assignment of `MOVETO` and `LINETO` codes when iterating over the paths and concatenating vertices. Additionally, we need to ensure that the correct code type is used for comparisons.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
    codes = np.concatenate([x.codes if x.codes is not None else np.repeat(cls.MOVETO, len(x.vertices)) for x in args])

    return cls(vertices, codes)
```
