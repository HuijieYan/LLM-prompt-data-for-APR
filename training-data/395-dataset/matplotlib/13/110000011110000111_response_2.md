The error occurs because the function `make_compound_path` is not properly handling the `STOP` code in the input paths. This leads to incorrect behavior when trying to sum the `STOP` codes in the test function.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `STOP` code is correctly handled in the `make_compound_path` function.

Here is the corrected code for the `make_compound_path` function:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices_list = [x.vertices for x in args]
    codes_list = [x.codes for x in args if x.codes is not None]

    vertices = np.concatenate(vertices_list)
    codes = np.concatenate(codes_list) if codes_list else None

    return cls(vertices, codes)
```

In the corrected code:
- We loop through each path in `args` to extract the vertices and codes, and then concatenate them properly.
- We handle the case where `codes` is `None` by only concatenating the codes if they are not `None`.
- We then return the compounded path with the concatenated vertices and codes.

This should fix the bug and ensure that the `STOP` code is properly handled in the `make_compound_path` function.
