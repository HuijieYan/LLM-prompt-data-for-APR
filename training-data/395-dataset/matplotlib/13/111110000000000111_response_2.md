The bug in the provided function is that it tries to define multiple methods with the same name, which is not allowed in Python. The `vertices` and `codes` methods are defined twice with different signatures, which is causing the issue.

The reason for the bug is that only one method with a particular name can be defined within a class in Python. By defining the `vertices` and `codes` methods multiple times with different signatures, the class is violating this rule.

To fix the bug, we need to define the `vertices` and `codes` methods with different names or remove the duplicate method definitions altogether.

Here's the corrected code for the `Path` class:

```python
class Path():
    """
    A series of possibly disconnected, possibly closed, line and curve
    segments.
    ...
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def __init__(self, vertices, codes):
        self.vertices = vertices
        self.codes = codes

    @classmethod
    def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
        """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
        # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
        if not args:
            return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))
    
        vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
        codes = np.empty(len(vertices), dtype=cls.code_type)
        i = 0
        for path in args:
            if path.codes is None:
                codes[i] = cls.MOVETO
                codes[i + 1:i + len(path.vertices)] = cls.LINETO
            else:
                codes[i:i + len(path.codes)] = path.codes
            i += len(path.vertices)
    
        return cls(vertices, codes)
```

In this corrected code, I have removed the duplicate `vertices` and `codes` method definitions and added an `__init__` method to initialize the `vertices` and `codes`.
