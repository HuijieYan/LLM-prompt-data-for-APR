The error in the given function `make_compound_path` is that the `codes` array is not being populated correctly. The `codes` array should be populated based on the `path` codes if they exist, otherwise, it should be populated with `MOVETO` and `LINETO` values.

The bug occurs because the logic for populating the `codes` array based on `path` codes is incorrect. The index `i` is not being updated correctly, and the assignment of `LINETO` codes is also not being done properly.

To fix the bug, we need to properly update the index `i` and assign the `LINETO` codes, as well as handle the case when `path` codes are not present.

Here is the corrected code for the `make_compound_path` function:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
    codes = []
    last_code = cls.MOVETO
    for path in args:
        if path.codes is None:
            codes.extend([last_code] + [cls.LINETO] * (len(path.vertices)-1))
        else:
            codes.extend(path.codes)
            last_code = path.codes[-1]

    return cls(vertices, codes)
```

In this corrected code:
- We initialize an empty list `codes` instead of an empty numpy array.
- We use `extend` to add the codes to the list, and properly handle the `LINETO` codes based on the number of vertices in the `path`.
- We keep track of the last code used and update it as needed.

This corrected code should fix the bug and generate the correct `vertices` and `codes` for the compound path.
