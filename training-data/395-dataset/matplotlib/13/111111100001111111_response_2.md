The buggy function `make_compound_path` is concatenating the vertices and codes of the input `Path` objects incorrectly. It is not handling the indexing and concatenation of the codes array properly, resulting in unexpected behavior.

The bug is occurring because the function is using an incorrect index `i` for assigning the `codes`. This causes the `codes` array to be populated with incorrect values.

To fix the bug, the function should use the correct index for assigning the codes based on the length of each `Path` object.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
    codes = np.concatenate([x.codes for x in args])
    
    return cls(vertices, codes)
```

In this corrected function, we concatenate both the vertices and codes arrays properly and then create a new `Path` object with the concatenated arrays as input. This will ensure that the vertices and codes are correctly combined from all the input `Path` objects.
