The buggy function `make_compound_path` concatenates the vertices and codes of input `Path` objects in the `args` tuple. However, when `path.codes` is None, it incorrectly tries to assign `MOVETO` and `LINETO` values to the `codes` without considering the indices properly.

The error message indicates that the `assert` statement is comparing the sum of the `compound_path.codes` array with `Path.STOP`, but the actual value is not as expected, causing the test to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the case when `path.codes` is None and update the indexing of the `codes` array accordingly. 

Here's the corrected code for the `make_compound_path` function:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices_list = [x.vertices for x in args]
    codes_list = [x.codes for x in args if x.codes is not None]

    vertices = np.concatenate(vertices_list)
    codes = np.concatenate(codes_list) if codes_list else np.full(len(vertices), cls.MOVETO, dtype=cls.code_type)
    
    return cls(vertices, codes)
```

In the corrected function, we create separate `vertices_list` and `codes_list` lists to concatenate the vertices and codes of all input `Path` objects. Then, we handle the case when `codes` is None by using `np.full` to fill the array with the `cls.MOVETO` value.

This updated approach ensures proper handling of indices and correctly constructs the compound path from the input `Path` objects.
