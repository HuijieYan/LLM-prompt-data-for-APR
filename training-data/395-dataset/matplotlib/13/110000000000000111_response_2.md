Potential error location: 

The potential error location is the section where the `codes` array is being constructed. The condition `if path.codes is None` is causing the issue, as it is not handling the case where `path.codes` is not None.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:

The bug is occurring because the loop that is trying to construct the `codes` array is not handling the case where `path.codes` is not None. This is leading to incorrect construction of the `codes` array, which is causing the function to return incorrect results.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Check if `path.codes` is not None and handle it accordingly.
2. Ensure that the length of `codes` array matches the length of the `vertices` array.

Corrected code:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
    codes = np.empty(len(vertices), dtype=cls.code_type)
    i = 0
    for path in args:
        if path.codes is None:
            codes[i] = cls.MOVETO
            codes[i + 1:i + len(path.vertices)] = cls.LINETO
            i += len(path.vertices)
        else:
            codes[i:i + len(path.codes)] = path.codes
            i += len(path.codes)

    return cls(vertices, codes)
```
