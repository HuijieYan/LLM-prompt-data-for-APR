The test case `test_make_compound_path_stops` is testing the `make_compound_path` function. The test case creates an array of `Path` objects, each consisting of two zero coordinates and two corresponding codes `MOVETO` and `STOP`. Then it calls the `make_compound_path` function and checks if the count of `STOP` codes in the resulting `compound_path` is 1.

The error message indicates that the actual count of `STOP` codes in the `compound_path` is 3 instead of 1.

The potential error location within the `make_compound_path` function is related to how the codes are assigned in the for loop.

The bug occurs because the loop that populates the `codes` array in the `make_compound_path` function is incorrect. When `path.codes` is `None`, the code incorrectly sets codes for both `MOVETO` and `LINETO`, instead of handling the special case of `STOP`. Additionally, the indexing while updating the `codes` array is also incorrect.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to correctly handle the special case of `STOP` codes when `path.codes` is `None`, and correctly update the indices when populating the `codes` array.

Here's the corrected code for the `make_compound_path` function:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
    codes = np.empty(len(vertices), dtype=cls.code_type)
    i = 0
    for path in args:
        if path.codes is None:
            codes[i] = cls.MOVETO
            i += 1
            codes[i:i + len(path.vertices) - 1] = cls.LINETO
            i += len(path.vertices) - 1
            codes[i] = cls.STOP
        else:
            codes[i:i + len(path.codes)] = path.codes
            i += len(path.vertices)

    return cls(vertices, codes)
```
In the corrected code, when `path.codes` is `None`, the `codes` array is populated correctly with `MOVETO`, `LINETO`, and finally `STOP`. Additionally, the indices are updated correctly while populating the `codes` array.
