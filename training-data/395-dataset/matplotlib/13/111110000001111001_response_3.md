It seems that the `make_compound_path` method concatenates the vertices of the input paths but does not handle the codes properly, resulting in a mismatch between the lengths of the vertices and codes arrays.

The bug occurs because the 'codes' array is constructed incorrectly within the loop for concatenating code arrays. When 'path.codes' is None, it incorrectly assigns MOVETO to the 'codes' array and then tries to assign LINETO to the subsequent indices of the 'codes' array, resulting in incorrect indexing and assignment of values.

To fix this bug, we can modify the logic for concatenating the codes array and also concatenate the individual path codes when they are not None. Additionally, we should handle the case when 'path.codes' is None by assigning MOVETO followed by LINETO codes for the correct indices in the 'codes' array.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
@classmethod
def make_compound_path(cls, *args):
    """Make a compound path from a list of Path objects."""
    # Handle an empty list in args (i.e. no args).
    if not args:
        return Path(np.empty([0, 2], dtype=np.float32))

    vertices = np.concatenate([x.vertices for x in args])
    codes = np.concatenate([x.codes if x.codes is not None
                            else [cls.MOVETO, cls.LINETO] * ((len(x.vertices) - 1)//2)
                            for x in args])

    return cls(vertices, codes)
```

In the fixed code, when concatenating the codes array, we check if the 'path.codes' is not None. If it is not None, we simply concatenate the 'path.codes' array. Otherwise, we construct an array with alternate MOVETO and LINETO codes based on the number of vertices in the path. This ensures that the 'codes' array is constructed correctly for the compound path.
