The error occurs due to the `assert each_line.get_marker() == ''` statement failing, which indicates that the `each_line` marker is not empty as expected.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the part where the marker is set for different elements of the boxplot such as whiskers, caps, boxes, medians, fliers, and means.

The bug occurs because the markers for these elements are not being handled correctly and are not being overridden by the default marker set in the matplotlibrc file.

To fix the bug, the marker properties for the different boxplot elements need to be explicitly handled, ensuring that they are correctly overridden by the default marker set in the matplotlibrc file.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# class declaration containing the corrected function
class Axes(_AxesBase):
    # ... other methods ...

    def bxp(self, bxpstats, positions=None, widths=None, vert=True,
            patch_artist=False, shownotches=False, showmeans=False,
            showcaps=True, showbox=True, showfliers=True,
            boxprops=None, whiskerprops=None, flierprops=None,
            medianprops=None, capprops=None, meanprops=None,
            meanline=False, manage_ticks=True, zorder=None):
        """
        Drawing function for box and whisker plots.
        Make a box and whisker plot for each column of *x* or each
        vector in sequence *x*. The box extends from the lower to
        upper quartile values of the data, with a line at the median.
        The whiskers extend from the box to show the range of the data.
        Flier points are those past the end of the whiskers.

        result : dict
          A dictionary mapping each component of the boxplot to a list

          following keys (assuming vertical boxplots):
          ...
        """
        # ... existing code unchanged ...

        # Ensure that the markers for different boxplot elements are correctly set based on the default values
        final_whiskerprops['marker'] = ''
        final_capprops['marker'] = ''
        final_flierprops['marker'] = ''
        final_medianprops['marker'] = ''
        if meanline:
            final_meanprops['marker'] = '^'
        else:
            final_meanprops['marker'] = ''

        # ... existing code unchanged ...
```

In the corrected code, the `final_whiskerprops`, `final_capprops`, `final_flierprops`, and `final_medianprops` dictionaries are updated to override the marker property with an empty string. Additionally, the `final_meanprops` marker is set based on the `meanline` flag to ensure that it is correctly handled.

These changes ensure that the markers for different boxplot elements are appropriately set based on the default values and overridden when necessary.
