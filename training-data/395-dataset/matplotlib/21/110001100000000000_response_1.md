    Drawing function for box and whisker plots.

    Make a box and whisker plot for each column of *x* or each
    vector in sequence *x*.  The box extends from the lower to
    upper quartile values of the data, with a line at the median.
    The whiskers extend from the box to show the range of the
    data.  Flier points are those past the end of the whiskers.

    ... (full docstring omitted for brevity)

    Returns
        -------
    result : dict
    A dictionary mapping each component of the boxplot to a list
    of the `.Line2D` instances created. That dictionary has the
    following keys (assuming vertical boxplots):

    - ``boxes``: the main body of the boxplot showing the
        quartiles and the median's confidence intervals if
        enabled.

    - ``medians``: horizontal lines at the median of each box.

    - ``whiskers``: the vertical lines extending to the most
        extreme, non-outlier data points.

    - ``caps``: the horizontal lines at the ends of the
        whiskers.

    - ``fliers``: points representing data that extend beyond
        the whiskers (fliers).

    - ``means``: points or lines representing the means.
