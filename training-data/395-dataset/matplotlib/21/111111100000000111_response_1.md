The bug appears to be related to the `lines.marker : s` setting in the matplotlibrc file, which is causing unexpected results when using the `boxplot` function.

Upon analyzing the function, the issue could be related to the setting of markers for the boxplot, specifically in the `meanline` section of the `bxp` function.

The reason for the bug is that the matplotlibrc setting `lines.marker` is being applied to the boxplot markers as well, which is not the intended behavior.

To fix the bug, the `lines.marker` setting should not affect the markers used in the boxplot function. Instead, the marker for the boxplot should be explicitly defined within the `bxp` function without relying on the default settings from matplotlibrc.

Here's the corrected code for the `bxp` function:

```python
@cbook._rename_parameter("3.1", "manage_xticks", "manage_ticks")
def bxp(self, bxpstats, positions=None, widths=None, vert=True,
        patch_artist=False, shownotches=False, showmeans=False,
        showcaps=True, showbox=True, showfliers=True,
        boxprops=None, whiskerprops=None, flierprops=None,
        medianprops=None, capprops=None, meanprops=None,
        meanline=False, manage_ticks=True, zorder=None, marker=None):
    """
    Drawing function for box and whisker plots.
    ... (rest of the docstring remains unchanged)
    """

    # ... (previous code remains unchanged)

    if marker is None:
        if vert:
            marker = 's'  # Default marker for vertical boxplot
        else:
            marker = 'o'  # Default marker for horizontal boxplot

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

In this corrected version, we've added a new parameter `marker` to the `bxp` function signature, which allows the user to specify the marker for the boxplot. If no marker is provided, it defaults to 's' for vertical boxplots and 'o' for horizontal boxplots. This ensures that the behavior of the boxplot markers is decoupled from the `lines.marker` setting in the matplotlibrc file.
