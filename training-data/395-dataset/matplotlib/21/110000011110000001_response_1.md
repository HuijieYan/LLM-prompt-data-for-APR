The error message is indicating that the markers for `whiskers`, `caps`, `boxes`, and `medians` are not overridden by the default `''` marker, as expected.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the section where the properties for the various parts of the boxplot are set (`def line_props_with_rcdefaults` and the subsequent conditional statement involving `removed_prop`).

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function isn't correctly handling the setting of the markers due to the properties being set in the `line_props_with_rcdefaults` function and the subsequent `if` checks associated with `removed_prop`.

To fix the bug, the `line_props_with_rcdefaults` function should be reviewed, and the conditional `if` statement that resets the property should be adjusted to correctly set the marker property for each element of the boxplot.

```python
# The corrected function
def bxp(self, bxpstats, positions=None, widths=None, vert=True,
        patch_artist=False, shownotches=False, showmeans=False,
        showcaps=True, showbox=True, showfliers=True,
        boxprops=None, whiskerprops=None, flierprops=None,
        medianprops=None, capprops=None, meanprops=None,
        meanline=False, manage_ticks=True, zorder=None):
    # ... (previous implementation)

    for bxp_lines in ['whiskers', 'caps', 'boxes', 'medians']:
        for each_line in bxp_handle[bxp_lines]:
            each_line.set_marker('')  # Set the marker to '' for all elements

    return dict(whiskers=whiskers, caps=caps, boxes=boxes,
                medians=medians, fliers=fliers, means=means)
```

This corrected code contains an additional loop to manually set the marker to `''` for all elements in `whiskers`, `caps`, `boxes`, and `medians`. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the markers are correctly overridden.
