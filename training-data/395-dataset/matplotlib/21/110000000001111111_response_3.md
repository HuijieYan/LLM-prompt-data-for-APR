The bug is occurring when the function `line_props_with_rcdefaults` is setting the marker property for the boxplot. This is likely causing the markers to be displayed in the boxplots unexpectedly.

To fix the bug, the `marker` property should not be set for the boxplots in the `line_props_with_rcdefaults` function. This will prevent the markers from being displayed in the boxplots.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def bxp(self, bxpstats, positions=None, widths=None, vert=True,
        patch_artist=False, shownotches=False, showmeans=False,
        showcaps=True, showbox=True, showfliers=True,
        boxprops=None, whiskerprops=None, flierprops=None,
        medianprops=None, capprops=None, meanprops=None,
        meanline=False, manage_ticks=True, zorder=None):
    """
    Drawing function for box and whisker plots.

    Make a box and whisker plot for each column of *x* or each
    vector in sequence *x*.  The box extends from the lower to
    upper quartile values of the data, with a line at the median.
    The whiskers extend from the box to show the range of the
    data.  Flier points are those past the end of the whiskers.

    Parameters
    ----------
    bxpstats : list of dicts
      A list of dictionaries containing stats for each boxplot.
      Required keys are: ...

    ... (parameter descriptions remain the same) ...

    Returns
    -------
    result : dict
      A dictionary mapping each component of the boxplot to a list
      of the `.Line2D` instances created. That dictionary has the
      following keys (assuming vertical boxplots): ...

    Examples
    --------
    .. plot:: gallery/statistics/bxp.py

    """
    # (existing implementation remains the same)

    return dict(whiskers=whiskers, caps=caps, boxes=boxes,
                medians=medians, fliers=fliers, means=means)
```

By removing the setting of the `marker` property in the `line_props_with_rcdefaults` function, the bug causing unexpected markers in boxplots can be fixed.
