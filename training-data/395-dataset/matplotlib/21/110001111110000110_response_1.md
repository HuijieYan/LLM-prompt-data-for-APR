    Drawing function for box and whisker plots.

    Make a box and whisker plot for each column of *x* or each
    vector in sequence *x*.  The box extends from the lower to
    upper quartile values of the data, with a line at the median.
    The whiskers extend from the box to show the range of the
    data.  Flier points are those past the end of the whiskers.
