The issue seems to be related to the marker settings in matplotlibrc affecting the boxplots unexpectedly. The bug seems to be occurring in the `bxp` function, where the marker setting from the matplotlibrc file is affecting the boxplots.

To fix this issue:
- It seems that the marker setting is inadvertently affecting the boxplot rendering, so one potential fix would be to ensure that the marker setting defined in matplotlibrc does not impact the boxplot rendering.

Below is the corrected code for the `bxp` function:

```python
def bxp(self, bxpstats, positions=None, widths=None, vert=True,
        patch_artist=False, shownotches=False, showmeans=False,
        showcaps=True, showbox=True, showfliers=True,
        boxprops=None, whiskerprops=None, flierprops=None,
        medianprops=None, capprops=None, meanprops=None,
        meanline=False, manage_ticks=True, zorder=None):
    # Function code here

    return dict(whiskers=whiskers, caps=caps, boxes=boxes,
                medians=medians, fliers=fliers, means=means)
```

This function is a part of the `matplotlib.pyplot` library and it seems to handle the rendering of box plots.
