The error occurs while running the test function `test_boxplot_marker_behavior` where the marker for lines is expected to be overridden as an empty string, but it is still returning 's' which is the default marker value. This is a bug because the marker should be overridden as an empty string based on the `plt.rcParams['lines.marker']` setting in the test function.

The potential error location is within the `bxp` method of the `Axes` class in the `_Axes.py` file. The `line_props_with_rcdefaults` function inside the `bxp` method is incorrectly handling the marker properties, which is leading to the issue.

The bug occurs because the `line_props_with_rcdefaults` function does not correctly override the marker with an empty string as expected. It does not handle the marker properties in a way that reflects the settings in `plt.rcParams['lines.marker']`, `plt.rcParams['boxplot.flierprops.marker']`, and `plt.rcParams['boxplot.meanprops.marker']`.

To fix the bug, the `line_props_with_rcdefaults` function should be modified to handle the marker property correctly based on the rcParams settings. It should override the marker property with an empty string if the expected conditions are met.

The corrected code for the `bxp` method with the `line_props_with_rcdefaults` function is as follows:

```python
class Axes(_AxesBase):
    # ... other methods ...

    @cbook._rename_parameter("3.1", "manage_xticks", "manage_ticks")
    def bxp(self, bxpstats, positions=None, widths=None, vert=True,
            patch_artist=False, shownotches=False, showmeans=False,
            showcaps=True, showbox=True, showfliers=True,
            boxprops=None, whiskerprops=None, flierprops=None,
            medianprops=None, capprops=None, meanprops=None,
            meanline=False, manage_ticks=True, zorder=None, **kwargs):
        """
        Drawing function for box and whisker plots.
        The implementation details are omitted for brevity.
        """

        # ... existing implementation ...

        final_marker = ''
        if 'marker' in meanprops:
            final_marker = ''
            del meanprops['marker']

        final_meanprops = line_props_with_rcdefaults(
            'meanprops', meanprops, zdelta, final_marker)

        # ... existing implementation ...

        return dict(whiskers=whiskers, caps=caps, boxes=boxes,
                    medians=medians, fliers=fliers, means=means)
```

In the corrected code, `line_props_with_rcdefaults` now takes an extra parameter `final_marker` and checks if there is a 'marker' property in `meanprops`. If it exists, it overrides it with an empty string. This change ensures that the marker property behaves as expected based on the rcParams settings.
