        Drawing function for box and whisker plots.

        Make a box and whisker plot for each column of *x* or each
        vector in sequence *x*.  The box extends from the lower to
        upper quartile values of the data, with a line at the median.
        The whiskers extend from the box to show the range of the
        data.  Flier points are those past the end of the whiskers.
        Parameters
        ----------
        bxpstats : list of dicts
          A list of dictionaries containing stats for each boxplot.
          Required keys are:
