The bug occurs in the `bxp` method of the `Axes` class in the `matplotlib` library. The method is responsible for drawing box and whisker plots.

The issue appears to be related to setting the marker style in the `matplotlibrc` configuration file, which affects the markers in the boxplots. Additionally, there are some discrepancies in the input values and their expected results, which indicate potential errors in the method.

The reasons behind the bug could be related to:
1. Inconsistent use of marker settings that affect boxplots.
2. Use of marker-related configurations that conflict with boxplot drawing.

To fix the bug, the `bxp` method needs to be modified. The method should not be affected by marker-related configurations and should have consistent handling of markers. Additionally, the method should only use relevant configurations and parameters for boxplot drawing.

The corrected code for the `bxp` method in the `Axes` class is provided below:

```python
def bxp(self, bxpstats, positions=None, widths=None, vert=True,
        patch_artist=False, shownotches=False, showmeans=False,
        showcaps=True, showbox=True, showfliers=True,
        boxprops=None, whiskerprops=None, flierprops=None,
        medianprops=None, capprops=None, meanprops=None,
        meanline=False, manage_ticks=True, zorder=None):
    
    # ... existing implementation ...

    def line_props_with_rcdefaults(subkey, explicit, zdelta=0):
        # adjusted implementation
        d = {k.split('.')[-1]: v for k, v in rcParams.items()
             if k.startswith(f'boxplot.{subkey}')}
        if 'marker' in d:
            d.pop('marker')  # Remove marker settings
        d['zorder'] = zorder + zdelta
        if explicit is not None:
            d.update(
                cbook.normalize_kwargs(explicit, mlines.Line2D._alias_map))
        return d

    # ... remaining implementation ...
```

In the corrected code, we have modified the `line_props_with_rcdefaults` function to remove any marker settings from the dictionary `d`. This change ensures that marker-related settings do not interfere with the boxplot drawing within the `bxp` method. Additionally, the rest of the method is left unchanged to ensure that the boxplot drawing functionality is intact.
