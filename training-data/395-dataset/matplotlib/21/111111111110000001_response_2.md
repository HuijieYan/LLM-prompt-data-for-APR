The test case `test_boxplot_marker_behavior` is meant to ensure that the markers for different components of the boxplot are correctly set based on the `rcParams` configuration. The error message indicates that the actual marker value obtained from `each_line.get_marker()` is 's', whereas it was expected to be an empty string.

The potential error within the problematic function lies in the overridden marker properties. The code overrides marker properties for various boxplot components with an empty string, which contradicts the intention to use the markers specified in the `rcParams`.

The bug occurs because the code directly sets the marker properties to an empty string, rather than utilizing the marker properties defined in the `rcParams`.

To fix the bug, the code should use the marker properties from the `rcParams` rather than directly setting them to an empty string. This can be achieved by checking for the marker properties defined in the `rcParams` and then using those properties to set the markers for the boxplot components.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
@cbook._rename_parameter("3.1", "manage_xticks", "manage_ticks")
def bxp(self, bxpstats, positions=None, widths=None, vert=True,
        patch_artist=False, shownotches=False, showmeans=False,
        showcaps=True, showbox=True, showfliers=True,
        boxprops=None, whiskerprops=None, flierprops=None,
        medianprops=None, capprops=None, meanprops=None,
        meanline=False, manage_ticks=True, zorder=None):
    """
    Drawing function for box and whisker plots.

    Make a box and whisker plot for each column of *x* or each
    vector in sequence *x*.  The box extends from the lower to
    upper quartile values of the data, with a line at the median.
    The whiskers extend from the box to show the range of the
    data.  Flier points are those past the end of the whiskers.

    Parameters
    ----------

    # ... (parameters remain the same as in the original function) ...

    Examples
    --------
    .. plot:: gallery/statistics/bxp.py

    """
    # ... (omitted validation and computation code) ...

    for bxp_lines in ['whiskers', 'caps', 'boxes', 'medians', 'fliers', 'means']:
        for each_line in bxp_handle[bxp_lines]:
            # Check if the marker has been explicitly set in the rcParams
            explicit_marker = rcParams.get(f'boxplot.{bxp_lines}.marker', None)
            if explicit_marker is not None:
                assert each_line.get_marker() == explicit_marker
```
In the corrected code, we retrieve the explicitly set marker properties from `rcParams` and then use those properties to assert that the markers are correctly set for each boxplot component. This modification ensures that the markers are consistent with the configurations specified in the `rcParams`.
