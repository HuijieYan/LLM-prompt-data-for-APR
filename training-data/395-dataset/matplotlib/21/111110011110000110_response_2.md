# Corrected function
class Axes(_AxesBase):
    """
    The `Axes` contains most of the figure elements: `~.axis.Axis`,
    `~.axis.Tick`, `~.lines.Line2D`, `~.text.Text`, `~.patches.Polygon`, etc.,
    and sets the coordinate system.
    
    The `Axes` instance supports callbacks through a callbacks attribute which
    is a `~.cbook.CallbackRegistry` instance.  The events you can connect to
    are 'xlim_changed' and 'ylim_changed' and the callback will be called with
    func(*ax*) where *ax* is the `Axes` instance.
    
    Attributes
    ----------
    dataLim : `.Bbox`
        The bounding box enclosing all data displayed in the Axes.
    viewLim : `.Bbox`
        The view limits in data coordinates.

        Drawing function for box and whisker plots.
    
        Make a box and whisker plot for each column of *x* or each
        vector in sequence *x*.  The box extends from the lower to
        upper quartile values of the data, with a line at the median.
        The whiskers extend from the box to show the range of the
        data.  Flier points are those past the end of the whiskers.

        Returns
        -------
        result : dict
          A dictionary mapping each component of the boxplot to a list
          of the `.Line2D` instances created. That dictionary has the
          following keys (assuming vertical boxplots):
    
          - ``boxes``: the main body of the boxplot showing the
            quartiles and the median's confidence intervals if
            enabled.
    
          - ``medians``: horizontal lines at the median of each box.
