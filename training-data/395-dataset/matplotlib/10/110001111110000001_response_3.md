1. The test case "test_offset_text_visible" is attempting to check whether the offset text is visible after manipulating the tick parameters. The first assert statement checks if the offset text is visible, and the second assert statement checks if it's not visible after setting "label2On" to False.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the `set_tick_params` function, specifically in the handling of the 'label2On' parameter.

3. The error message indicates that the offset text is still visible when it is expected to be hidden after setting "label2On" to False. This implies that the `set_tick_params` function is not properly updating the visibility of the offset text based on the provided parameters.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when "label2On" is set to False, the offset text should also be hidden. Additionally, proper handling of the visibility of the offset text should be implemented based on the provided parameters.

5. Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def set_tick_params(self, which='major', reset=False, **kw):
    # ... (existing code) ...

    if 'label1On' in kw and not kw['label1On']:
        self.get_offset_text().set_visible(False)

    if 'label2On' in kw and not kw['label2On']:
        self.get_offset_text().set_visible(False)

    self.stale = True
```

In the corrected code, we explicitly check for the 'label1On' and 'label2On' parameters and set the visibility of the offset text accordingly. If either of these parameters is set to False, the offset text will be hidden. This should address the bug and ensure that the offset text visibility is updated correctly based on the provided tick parameters.
