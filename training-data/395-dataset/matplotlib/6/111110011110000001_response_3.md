The test case `test_scatter_single_color_c` is testing the behavior of the `scatter` function with various color inputs. The test case sets colors using the `color` and `c` arguments of the `scatter` function and then compares the resulting images.

The error message indicates that the images produced by the test and the reference are not close, with a Root Mean Square (RMS) value of 5.043. This means that the test is failing due to a difference in the images.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the `_parse_scatter_color_args` method, specifically in the logic related to the 'color' and 'edgecolor' arguments.

The bug occurs because the logic for handling color-related arguments within the `_parse_scatter_color_args` method is flawed, likely leading to incorrect color handling in the `scatter` method, which in turn is causing the test failure.

To fix the bug, the code within the `_parse_scatter_color_args` method needs to be thoroughly reviewed and corrected to ensure that the color-related arguments are processed accurately and consistently, following the specifications provided in the method's docstring.

Here's the corrected code for the `_parse_scatter_color_args` method:

```python
@staticmethod
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func):
    # Rest of the method remains the same; only the problematic areas are reviewed and fixed
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolors', None)
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolor', facecolors)

    edgecolors = kwargs.pop('edgecolor', edgecolors)

    kwcolor = kwargs.pop('color', None)

    if kwcolor is not None and c is not None:
        raise ValueError("Supply a 'c' argument or a 'color'"
                         " kwarg but not both; they differ but"
                         " their functionalities overlap.")

    if kwcolor is not None:
        if edgecolors is None:
            edgecolors = kwcolor
        if facecolors is None:
            facecolors = kwcolor

    if edgecolors is None and not rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']:
        edgecolors = rcParams['scatter.edgecolors']

    c_was_none = c is None
    if c is None:
        c = (facecolors if facecolors is not None
             else "b" if rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']
             else get_next_color_func())
    # Rest of the method remains the same

    return c, colors, edgecolors
```

This corrected method ensures that the color-related arguments are processed and handled as specified in the docstring, which should resolve the underlying bug causing the test failure.
