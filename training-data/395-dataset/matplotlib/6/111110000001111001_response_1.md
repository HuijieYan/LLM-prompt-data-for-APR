The issue with the function is that it is returning a list when it's expected to return a NumPy array in certain scenarios, which causes an inconsistency in the return type and affects the subsequent operations in the code.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `c` variable (color) is being handled inconsistently within the function, resulting in unexpected return types and values.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `c` variable is always returned as a NumPy array when applicable, and we also need to handle the different scenarios for `c` consistently.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

class Axes(_AxesBase):
    # ... omitted code ...
    
    @staticmethod
    def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func):
        # ... omitted code ...
    
        if kwcolor is not None:
            kwcolor_arr = np.atleast_2d(np.asarray(kwcolor))
            if c is None:
                c = kwcolor_arr
            if edgecolors is None:
                edgecolors = kwcolor_arr
            if facecolors is None:
                facecolors = kwcolor_arr
    
        if edgecolors is None and not rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']:
            edgecolors = rcParams['scatter.edgecolors']
    
        c_was_none = c is None
        c_asarray = np.atleast_2d(np.asarray(c))
        if c_was_none:
            # Use 'b' if in classic mode else the result of ``get_next_color_func()``
            c = ('b' if rcParams['_internal.classic_mode'] else get_next_color_func())
    
        c_is_string_or_strings = (
            isinstance(c, str)
            or (np.iterable(c) and len(c) > 0 and isinstance(cbook.safe_first_element(c), str)))
    
        if c_asarray.size != xsize:
            raise ValueError(f"'c' argument has {c_asarray.size} elements, which is inconsistent with 'x' and 'y' with size {xsize}.")
    
        colors = mcolors.to_rgba_array(c)
    
        return c, colors, edgecolors
```

In the corrected code, we consistently convert color arrays to NumPy arrays using `np.atleast_2d(np.asarray())` before processing them. Additionally, we handle the different scenarios for `c` more clearly and consistently.
