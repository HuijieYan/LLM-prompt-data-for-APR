The issue with the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function is that it does not properly handle the `c` input parameter, which can be a color, a sequence of colors, or a sequence of numbers. The function needs to handle these different types of input properly and return the correct colors for the scatter plot.

The function's calculation of the `colors` variable does not properly handle the mapping of the input colors and the use of color sequences for facecolors and edgecolors.

To fix the bug, the following approach can be taken:
- Check if the input `c` is a color, a sequence of colors, or a sequence of numbers, and handle each case separately.
- Handle the mapping of input colors correctly based on their size and shape, and ensure that the correct colors are returned for the scatter plot.

Here's the corrected code for the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function:

```python
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func):
    # ... (other code)

    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolors', None)
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolor', facecolors)
    edgecolors = kwargs.pop('edgecolor', edgecolors)

    kwcolor = kwargs.pop('color', None)
    
    c = mcolors.to_rgba_array(c) if c is not None else None
    kwcolor = mcolors.to_rgba_array(kwcolor) if kwcolor is not None else None

    if kwcolor is not None and c is not None:
        raise ValueError("Supply a 'c' argument or a 'color'"
                        " kwarg but not both; they differ but"
                        " their functionalities overlap.")
    
    if kwcolor is not None:
        if edgecolors is None:
            edgecolors = kwcolor
        if facecolors is None:
            facecolors = kwcolor

    if edgecolors is None and not rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']:
        edgecolors = rcParams['scatter.edgecolors']
    
    # Handle c as color, sequence of colors, or sequence of numbers
    # Mapping and RGBA conversion
    if c is not None:
        if c.shape in ((3,), (4,)):
            c = np.array([c])
        colors = mcolors.to_rgba_array(c)
    else:
        colors = None

    return c, colors, edgecolors
```

With these changes, the function properly handles the different types of input for `c`, performs the mapping and RGBA conversion, and returns the correct colors for the scatter plot.
