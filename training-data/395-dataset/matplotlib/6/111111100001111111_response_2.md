Potential error location: The issue seems to be occurring in the logic to handle the c argument in the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function. When a 2D array with a single row is provided for the RGB or RGBA color, the function is not correctly handling it, leading to the scatter plot elements having multiple colors instead of the expected single color.

Reasons behind the bug:
The bug is occurring because the logic for handling a 2D array with a single row for the RGB/RGBA color input is not correctly implemented. As a result, the scatter plot elements are being assigned multiple colors instead of a single color.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the input array is 2D and has a single row. If so, extract the RGB/RGBA color values from the single row and apply the same color to all scatter plot elements.
2. Ensure that the color handling logic correctly identifies the input as a single RGB/RGBA color and treats it accordingly.
3. Update the logic to handle the c argument in the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function to handle single RGB/RGBA color input in a 2D array correctly.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func):
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolors', None)
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolor', facecolors)
    edgecolors = kwargs.pop('edgecolor', edgecolors)

    kwcolor = kwargs.pop('color', None)

    if kwcolor is not None and c is not None:
        raise ValueError("Supply a 'c' argument or a 'color'"
                         " kwarg but not both; they differ but"
                         " their functionalities overlap.")

    if kwcolor is not None:
        try:
            mcolors.to_rgba_array(kwcolor)
        except ValueError as err:
            raise ValueError(
                "'color' kwarg must be a color or sequence of color "
                "specs.  For a sequence of values to be color-mapped, use "
                "the 'c' argument instead.") from err
        if edgecolors is None:
            edgecolors = kwcolor
        if facecolors is None:
            facecolors = kwcolor

    if edgecolors is None and not rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']:
        edgecolors = rcParams['scatter.edgecolors']

    c_was_none = c is None
    if c is None:
        c = (facecolors if facecolors is not None
             else "b" if rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']
             else get_next_color_func())
    c_is_string_or_strings = (
        isinstance(c, str)
        or (np.iterable(c) and len(c) > 0
            and isinstance(cbook.safe_first_element(c), str)))

    if c_was_none and c.size == 1:
        c = c.ravel()

    return c, None, edgecolors
