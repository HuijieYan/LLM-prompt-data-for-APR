The bug is related to the handling of the 'c' argument in the scatter plot when passing a single RGB or RGBA color for all scatter elements.

The potential error location within the function is the section where it checks the shape and type of the 'c' argument.

The bug occurs because the function incorrectly handles the scenario where a single RGB or RGBA color is provided as input for the 'c' argument. Instead of treating it as a single color for all points, it currently interprets it as multiple colors and uses the default colormap, resulting in different colors for each point.

To fix the bug, the function should check whether the 'c' argument represents a single color (RGB/RGBA) and handle it appropriately to ensure that all points have the same color. This can be done by modifying the logic to correctly interpret the shape and type of the 'c' argument and treat it as a single color when necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func):
    # ... (previous code) ...

    c = np.asanyarray(c)
    # Check if 'c' is a single RGB or RGBA color
    if c.shape == (1, 3) or c.shape == (1, 4):
        c = c.ravel()  # Flatten the 2D array to a 1D array
        c = c.reshape(1, -1)  # Reshape to ensure consistency
    else:
        # Handle other cases as before
        c_was_none = c is None
        # ... (remaining code) ...
    # ... (remaining code) ...
    return c, colors, edgecolors
```

In the corrected code, we check if the shape of the 'c' argument corresponds to a single RGB or RGBA color, and if so, we flatten and reshape it to ensure it is treated as a single color for all points. This modification ensures that when a single RGB or RGBA color is provided, all points in the scatter plot will have the same color.
