The error seems to be related to the color argument passed to the `scatter` function. Specifically, the `test_scatter_single_color_c` test case is intended to test the scatter plots using single RGB/RGBA colors provided as a 2D array with a single row. However, the error message indicates that the images produced by the test are not close, and the RMS difference is reported. This suggests that the scatter plots are not producing the expected results.

The potential error location is within the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function, specifically in the logic related to processing the color arguments and handling the edge cases for facecolors and edgecolors.

The bug seems to occur because the logic for processing single RGB/RGBA colors provided as a 2D array with a single row is not correctly handled in the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function. This leads to incorrect colors being applied to the scatter points, resulting in the failure of the test case.

To fix the bug, the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the case of single RGB/RGBA colors provided as a 2D array with a single row. This includes updating the logic for processing facecolors and edgecolors, as well as ensuring that the correct color is passed to the scatter plots.

Here's the corrected code for the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function:

```python
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func):
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolors', None)
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolor', facecolors)
    edgecolors = kwargs.pop('edgecolor', edgecolors)

    kwcolor = kwargs.pop('color', None)

    if kwcolor is not None and c is not None:
        raise ValueError("Supply a 'c' argument or a 'color' kwarg but not both; they differ but their functionalities overlap.")

    if kwcolor is not None:
        try:
            mcolors.to_rgba_array(kwcolor)
        except ValueError as err:
            raise ValueError(
                "'color' kwarg must be a color or sequence of color specs.  For a sequence of values to be color-mapped, use the 'c' argument instead.") from err
        if edgecolors is None:
            edgecolors = kwcolor
        if facecolors is None:
            facecolors = kwcolor

    if edgecolors is None and not rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']:
        edgecolors = rcParams['scatter.edgecolors']

    c_was_none = c is None
    if c is None:
        c = (facecolors if facecolors is not None
             else "b" if rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']
             else get_next_color_func())

    return c, None, edgecolors
```

In the corrected code, the processing of facecolors, edgecolors, and the default color is simplified to ensure that when a single RGB/RGBA color provided as a 2D array with a single row is passed, it is correctly applied to all the scatter points.

This should address the bug and ensure that the scatter plots produce the expected results when using a single RGB/RGBA color provided as a 2D array with a single row.
