The bug occurs due to incorrect handling of the input RGB/RGBA color data in the `_parse_scatter_color_args` method of the `Axes` class. This leads to the scatter plot producing multiple colors for a single RGB/RGBA input.

The issue can be fixed by appropriately handling the input RGB/RGBA color data and ensuring that all points have the same color.

Here is the corrected code for the `_parse_scatter_color_args` method:

```python
@staticmethod
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func):
    # ... (previous code)
    
    if kwcolor is not None:
        try:
            mcolors.to_rgba_array(kwcolor)
        except ValueError as err:
            raise ValueError(
                "'color' kwarg must be a color or sequence of color "
                "specs.  For a sequence of values to be color-mapped, use "
                "the 'c' argument instead.") from err
        edgecolors = kwcolor if edgecolors is None else edgecolors
        facecolors = kwcolor if facecolors is None else facecolors
    
    # Rest of the code remains the same
```

By updating this portion of the code, the scatter plot function will correctly handle the input RGB/RGBA color data and ensure that all points have the same color, as expected.

Additionally, the test case provided demonstrates the correct usage of the scatter plot function for the expected outcome. The error message from the test function indicates that the bug fix is necessary for the correct behavior of the scatter plot.
