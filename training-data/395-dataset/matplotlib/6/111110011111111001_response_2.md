The bug occurs in the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function. This function is used to process color-related arguments for the `scatter` method in the `Axes` class.

Upon analysis, it appears that the bug occurs when the `c` parameter is provided as a list of lists such as `[[1, 0.5, 0.05]]` or `[[1, 0.5, 0.05, 0.5]]`. This causes the subsequent processing of the color arguments to fail, leading to the test failure.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `c` parameter is handled correctly, especially when it is provided as a list of color values. Additionally, we need to review the logic for processing the color arguments to ensure that it can handle different input formats for colors effectively.

Here's the corrected `def _parse_scatter_color_args` function:

```python
@staticmethod
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func):
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolors', None)
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolor', facecolors)
    edgecolors = kwargs.pop('edgecolor', edgecolors)

    kwcolor = kwargs.pop('color', None)

    if kwcolor is not None and c is not None:
        raise ValueError("Supply a 'c' argument or a 'color'"
                         " kwarg but not both; they differ but"
                         " their functionalities overlap.")

    if kwcolor is not None:
        try:
            mcolors.to_rgba_array(kwcolor)
        except ValueError as err:
            raise ValueError(
                "'color' kwarg must be a color or sequence of color "
                "specs.  For a sequence of values to be color-mapped, use "
                "the 'c' argument instead.") from err
        if edgecolors is None:
            edgecolors = kwcolor
        if facecolors is None:
            facecolors = kwcolor

    if edgecolors is None and not rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']:
        edgecolors = rcParams['scatter.edgecolors']

    c = np.asanyarray(c)
    if c.ndim == 2 and c.shape[1] in [3, 4]:
        c = c.ravel()
    
    if len(c) not in [0, 1, xsize]:
        raise ValueError(
            f"'c' argument has {len(c)} elements, which is inconsistent "
            f"with 'x' and 'y' with size {xsize}.")
    
    colors = mcolors.to_rgba_array(c)

    return c, colors, edgecolors
```

In the corrected code, we ensure that the `c` parameter is converted to a NumPy array and its dimensions are checked to handle both RGB and RGBA color formats. We also validate the number of elements in `c` to ensure consistency with the sizes of the `x` and `y` arrays. Finally, we use the `mcolors.to_rgba_array` method to convert the color values to RGBA format.
