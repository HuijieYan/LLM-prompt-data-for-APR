The error occurs when creating a scatter plot with a single RGB/RGBA color input. The bug causes the plot elements to have multiple different colors instead of the single color provided.

The potential error location is within the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function, where the RGB/RGBA input is not being handled correctly.

The bug occurs because the function fails to properly handle the case where a single RGB/RGBA color input is provided as a 2D array with a single row. This results in the scatter plot elements being assigned multiple different colors.

To fix the bug, the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function needs to be adjusted to properly handle the case where a single RGB/RGBA color input is provided as a 2D array with a single row. This involves checking the dimensions of the input array and ensuring that the scatter plot elements are assigned the correct single color.

Here's the corrected code for the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function:

```python
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func):
    # ... omitted code ...

    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolors', None)
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolor', facecolors)
    edgecolors = kwargs.pop('edgecolor', edgecolors)

    kwcolor = kwargs.pop('color', None)

    if kwcolor is not None and c is not None:
        raise ValueError("Supply a 'c' argument or a 'color'"
                         " kwarg but not both; they differ but"
                         " their functionalities overlap.")

    if kwcolor is not None:
        try:
            mcolors.to_rgba_array(kwcolor)
        except ValueError as err:
            raise ValueError(
                "'color' kwarg must be a color or sequence of color "
                "specs.  For a sequence of values to be color-mapped, use "
                "the 'c' argument instead.") from err
        if edgecolors is None:
            edgecolors = kwcolor
        if facecolors is None:
            facecolors = kwcolor

    if edgecolors is None and not rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']:
        edgecolors = rcParams['scatter.edgecolors']

    c_was_none = c is None
    if c is None:
        c = (facecolors if facecolors is not None
             else "b" if rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']
             else get_next_color_func())
    
    c_is_string_or_strings = (
        isinstance(c, str)
        or (np.iterable(c) and len(c) > 0
            and isinstance(cbook.safe_first_element(c), str)))

    if c_was_none:
        if c_is_string_or_strings:
            raise ValueError("If 'c' was None, 'c' cannot be a string or a sequence of strings.")
        c = np.atleast_2d(c)
        if c.shape[0] > 1:
            raise ValueError("'c' argument must have only one row if it is a 2D array.")

    c = c[0]  # Use the first row of the 2D array

    colors = mcolors.to_rgba_array(c)

    return c, colors, edgecolors
```

The correction involves checking if the input `c` is `None` and handling the case where a single RGB/RGBA color input is provided as a 2D array with a single row. The first row is extracted and used as the color for the scatter plot elements.
