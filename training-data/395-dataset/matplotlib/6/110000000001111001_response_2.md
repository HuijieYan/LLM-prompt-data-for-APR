The bug seems to be occurring in the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function due to incorrect array manipulation and type mismatches.

Upon examination, it appears that there are inconsistencies between the type of input and output variables, such as `edgecolors` and `c`. This discrepancy is causing issues with the conditional checks and the subsequent flow of the function.

To fix this bug, the following approaches can be considered:
1. Validate the input data types and ensure consistency throughout the function.
2. Handle edge cases such as `c` being `None` or an empty array appropriately.
3. Ensure that the array manipulation and conversion operations are performed correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function:

```python
@staticmethod
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func):
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolors', None)
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolor', facecolors)
    edgecolors = kwargs.pop('edgecolor', edgecolors)

    kwcolor = kwargs.pop('color', None)

    if kwcolor is not None and c is not None:
        raise ValueError("Supply a 'c' argument or a 'color' kwarg but not both; they differ but their functionalities overlap.")

    if kwcolor is not None:
        mcolors.to_rgba_array(kwcolor)
        if edgecolors is None:
            edgecolors = kwcolor
        if facecolors is None:
            facecolors = kwcolor

    if edgecolors is None and not rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']:
        edgecolors = rcParams['scatter.edgecolors']

    if c is None:
        if facecolors is not None:
            c = facecolors
        elif rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']:
            c = "b"
        else:
            c = get_next_color_func()

    if isinstance(c, str) or (np.iterable(c) and len(c) > 0 and isinstance(cbook.safe_first_element(c), str)):
        c_is_string_or_strings = True
    else:
        c_is_string_or_strings = False

    c_is_mapped = False
    valid_shape = True
    if not c_is_string_or_strings:
        try:
            c = np.asanyarray(c, dtype=float)
            if c.size == xsize:
                c = c.ravel()
                c_is_mapped = True
            else:
                valid_shape = False
        except:
            pass

    if not c_is_mapped:
        try:
            colors = mcolors.to_rgba_array(c)
            if len(colors) in (0, 1, xsize):
                colors = colors
            else:
                raise ValueError(f"'c' argument has {len(colors)} elements, which is inconsistent with 'x' and 'y' with size {xsize}.")
        except:
            raise ValueError(f"'c' argument must be a color, a sequence of colors, or a sequence of numbers, not {c}")
    else:
        colors = None

    return c, colors, edgecolors
```

By implementing these changes, we can ensure that the input and output variables are handled correctly, leading to the expected behavior of the function.
