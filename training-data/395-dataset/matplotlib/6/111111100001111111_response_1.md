The issue here is that when a single RGB or RGBA color is passed as a 2D array with a single row to the `scatter` function, the plot elements have several different colors instead of all having the same color.

The potential error location is in the `_parse_scatter_color_args` method where the code tries to handle the color and edgecolor arguments. It fails to handle the case where a single RGB or RGBA color is passed as a 2D array with a single row.

The bug occurs because the code incorrectly handles the case where a single RGB or RGBA color is passed as a 2D array with a single row. It should treat this input as a single color and use it for all points, but instead, it appears to be interpreting the array as multiple colors and mapping each element to a different color.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `_parse_scatter_color_args` method to correctly handle the case where a single RGB or RGBA color is passed as a 2D array with a single row. This involves ensuring that the color input is correctly interpreted as a single color and used for all points.

Below is the corrected code for the `_parse_scatter_color_args` method:

```python
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func):
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolors', None)
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolor', facecolors)
    edgecolors = kwargs.pop('edgecolor', edgecolors)
    kwcolor = kwargs.pop('color', None)
    
    if kwcolor is not None and c is not None:
        raise ValueError("Supply a 'c' argument or a 'color' kwarg but not both; they differ but their functionalities overlap.")
    
    if kwcolor is not None:
        if isinstance(kwcolor, (list, tuple)):
            kwcolor = np.asarray(kwcolor)
        try:
            mcolors.to_rgba_array(kwcolor)
        except ValueError as err:
            raise ValueError(
                "'color' kwarg must be a color or sequence of color "
                "specs.  For a sequence of values to be color-mapped, use "
                "the 'c' argument instead."
            ) from err
            
        if edgecolors is None:
            edgecolors = kwcolor
        if facecolors is None:
            facecolors = kwcolor
    
    if edgecolors is None and not rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']:
        edgecolors = rcParams['scatter.edgecolors']
    
    if c is None:
        c = (facecolors if facecolors is not None
             else "b" if rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']
             else get_next_color_func())
    
    if len(c) == 1:
        c = np.broadcast_to(c, (xsize, c.size))
    
    if not c.size == xsize:
        raise ValueError(
            f"'c' argument has {c.size} elements, which is inconsistent "
            f"with 'x' and 'y' with size {xsize}."
        )

    colors = mcolors.to_rgba_array(c)
    
    return c, colors, edgecolors
```

In the corrected code, we first check if the input color is a single color, and if so, we broadcast it to be the same size as `xsize`. Then, we verify that the size of the color array matches the size of `x` and `y`, and if not, we raise a ValueError. Finally, we convert the colors to RGBA using `mcolors.to_rgba_array` and return the required values.
