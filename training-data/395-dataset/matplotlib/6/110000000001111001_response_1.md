The issue occurs when trying to convert the list `c` into an array. In some cases, `c` is already a NumPy array, so converting it to an array causes a problem. The conversion causes the shape and size of the array to change, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `c` is already a NumPy array before attempting to convert it. If it is, we should skip the conversion step.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np

@staticmethod
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func):
    # Existing code...

    # Convert c to a NumPy array only if it's not already an array
    if not isinstance(c, np.ndarray):
        c = np.asanyarray(c, dtype=float)

    # Rest of the code...
    
    return c, colors, edgecolors
```
