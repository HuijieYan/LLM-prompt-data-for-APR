The bug seems to be occurring in the `def _parse_scatter_color_args` method of matplotlib's `_axes.py` file. It appears that the bug is related to the handling of a single RGB/RGBA color specified as a 2D array with a single row.

The issue arises because the `c` argument is not correctly handled when it is specified as a 2D array with a single row. This causes multiple colors to be produced for a single RGB/RGBA input.

To fix this bug, the `def _parse_scatter_color_args` method needs to be modified to correctly handle the case where a single RGB/RGBA color is specified as a 2D array with a single row.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func):
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolors', None)
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolor', facecolors)
    edgecolors = kwargs.pop('edgecolor', edgecolors)
    
    kwcolor = kwargs.pop('color', None)
    
    if kwcolor is not None and c is not None:
        raise ValueError("Supply a 'c' argument or a 'color'"
                         " kwarg but not both; they differ but"
                         " their functionalities overlap.")
    
    if kwcolor is not None:
        try:
            mcolors.to_rgba_array(kwcolor)
        except ValueError as err:
            raise ValueError(
                "'color' kwarg must be a color or sequence of color "
                "specs.  For a sequence of values to be color-mapped, use "
                "the 'c' argument instead.") from err
        if edgecolors is None:
            edgecolors = kwcolor
        if facecolors is None:
            facecolors = kwcolor
    
    if edgecolors is None and not rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']:
        edgecolors = rcParams['scatter.edgecolors']

    c = np.broadcast_to(c, (1, len(c))) if c.ndim == 1 else c
    
    return c, np.broadcast_to(facecolors, (xsize, len(facecolors))), edgecolors
```

This code snippet handles the case where a single RGB/RGBA color is specified as a 2D array with a single row. It uses `np.broadcast_to` to ensure that the shapes of `c` and `facecolors` match the size of `xsize`.
