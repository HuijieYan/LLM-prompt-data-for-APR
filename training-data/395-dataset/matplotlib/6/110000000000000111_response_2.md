The issue reported here is related to the scatter plot in Matplotlib producing multiple colors for a single RGB/RGBA input. The user expects that when providing a single RGB/RGBA color for all scatter elements, using a 2D array with a single row should result in all plot elements having the same color.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the section where the function is trying to determine if the provided 'c' input is acceptable as PathCollection facecolors. This section seems to be incorrectly determining the colors for the scatter plot, leading to the issue reported by the user.

The bug occurred because the current implementation does not correctly handle a 2D array input with a single row for RGB/RGBA values, causing the scatter plot to display multiple colors instead of the expected single color. The function is not adhering to the documentation's recommendation of using a 2D array with a single row to specify the same RGB/RGBA value for all points.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be modified to correctly handle the case where a 2D array with a single row is provided for RGB/RGBA values, ensuring that all plot elements receive the same color.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@staticmethod
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize,
                              get_next_color_func):
    # ... existing docstring and function parameters ...

    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolors', None)
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolor', facecolors)
    edgecolors = kwargs.pop('edgecolor', edgecolors)

    kwcolor = kwargs.pop('color', None)

    if kwcolor is not None and c is not None:
        raise ValueError("Supply a 'c' argument or a 'color'"
                         " kwarg but not both; they differ but"
                         " their functionalities overlap.")

    if kwcolor is not None:
        try:
            mcolors.to_rgba_array(kwcolor)
        except ValueError as err:
            raise ValueError(
                "'color' kwarg must be a color or sequence of color "
                "specs.  For a sequence of values to be color-mapped, use "
                "the 'c' argument instead.") from err
        if edgecolors is None:
            edgecolors = kwcolor
        if facecolors is None:
            facecolors = kwcolor

    if edgecolors is None and not rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']:
        edgecolors = rcParams['scatter.edgecolors']

    c_was_none = c is None
    if c is None:
        c = (facecolors if facecolors is not None
             else "b" if rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']
             else get_next_color_func())

    csize = 1 if isinstance(c, (list, np.ndarray)) else len(c)
    if csize == 1:
        c = np.broadcast_to(c, (xsize, csize))
        c = c[0]

    return c, edgecolors
```

This corrected function handles the case where a 2D array with a single row for RGB/RGBA values is provided and ensures that all plot elements receive the same color.
