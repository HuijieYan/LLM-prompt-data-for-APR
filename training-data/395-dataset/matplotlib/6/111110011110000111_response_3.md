The test case `test_scatter_single_color_c` is related to the error message, indicating that there is an issue with scatter plots not displaying the correct color when using single RGB/RGBA input.

The potential error location within the `Axes` class is the `_parse_scatter_color_args` method, specifically the section where the color input is processed and handled.
The bug occurs because the method does not properly handle the case when a single RGB/RGBA color is passed as a 2D array with a single row. Instead of interpreting it as a single color for all points, it tries to interpret it as multiple colors.

To fix this bug, the method `_parse_scatter_color_args` needs to be modified to correctly handle the case when a single RGB/RGBA color is passed as a 2D array with a single row. This includes checking the shape of the input and ensuring that it is treated as a single color for all points.

The corrected method `_parse_scatter_color_args` is as follows:

```python
@staticmethod
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func):
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolors', None)
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolor', facecolors)
    edgecolors = kwargs.pop('edgecolor', edgecolors)

    kwcolor = kwargs.pop('color', None)

    if kwcolor is not None and c is not None:
        raise ValueError("Supply a 'c' argument or a 'color' kwarg but not both; they differ but their functionalities overlap.")

    if kwcolor is not None:
        try:
            mcolors.to_rgba_array(kwcolor)
        except ValueError as err:
            raise ValueError(
                "'color' kwarg must be a color or sequence of color specs.  For a sequence of values to be color-mapped, use the 'c' argument instead.") from err

        if edgecolors is None:
            edgecolors = kwcolor
        if facecolors is None:
            facecolors = kwcolor

    if edgecolors is None and not rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']:
        edgecolors = rcParams['scatter.edgecolors']

    if c is None:
        c = (facecolors if facecolors is not None else "b" if rcParams['_internal.classic_mode'] else get_next_color_func())

    csize = len(c) if isinstance(c, (list, np.ndarray)) else 1

    if csize == 1:  # single color input
        c = np.broadcast_to(c, (xsize, len(c[0])))

    colors = None  # use cmap, norm after collection is created

    return c, colors, edgecolors
```

In the corrected code, an additional check for `c` being a single color input is introduced. If `c` is a single color, it is broadcasted to match the size of the data arrays, ensuring that it is treated as a single color for all points.
