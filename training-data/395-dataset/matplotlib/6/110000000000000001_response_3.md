Potential error location: The `facecolor` is being popped from `kwargs` but not assigned to the `facecolors` variable.

Reasons behind the bug: The `facecolor` is being popped from `kwargs` but not assigned to the `facecolors` variable, which can lead to inconsistency in the function's behavior.

Possible approach for fixing the bug: Assign the popped `facecolor` to the `facecolors` variable.

Corrected code:
```python
@staticmethod
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize,
                              get_next_color_func):
    """
    Helper function to process color related arguments of `.Axes.scatter`.

    .. rest of the docstring ..

    """
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolors', None)
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolor', facecolors)  # Assign the popped facecolor to facecolors
    edgecolors = kwargs.pop('edgecolor', edgecolors)

    kwcolor = kwargs.pop('color', None)

    if kwcolor is not None and c is not None:
        raise ValueError("Supply a 'c' argument or a 'color'"
                         " kwarg but not both; they differ but"
                         " their functionalities overlap.")

    if kwcolor is not None:
        try:
            mcolors.to_rgba_array(kwcolor)
        except ValueError as err:
            raise ValueError(
                "'color' kwarg must be an color or sequence of color "
                "specs.  For a sequence of values to be color-mapped, use "
                "the 'c' argument instead.") from err
        if edgecolors is None:
            edgecolors = kwcolor
        if facecolors is None:
            facecolors = kwcolor

    if edgecolors is None and not rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']:
        edgecolors = rcParams['scatter.edgecolors']

    c_was_none = c is None
    if c is None:
        c = (facecolors if facecolors is not None
             else "b" if rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']
             else get_next_color_func())
    # rest of the function ...
    ```

The code has been corrected by adding the assignment of the popped `facecolor` to the `facecolors` variable.
