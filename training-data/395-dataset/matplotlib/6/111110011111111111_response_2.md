The error is likely occurring in the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function. It seems that when passing a single RGB or RGBA color as a 2D array with a single row (e.g. `c=[[1, 0.5, 0.05]]`), the plot elements have several different colors instead of all having the same color.

The issue is likely due to incorrect handling of the input RGB/RGBA color when it is passed as a 2D array with a single row.

To fix the bug, the function `_parse_scatter_color_args` needs to be modified to correctly handle the input RGB/RGBA color when it is passed as a 2D array with a single row. The function should check for this specific scenario and ensure that all points have the same color as specified in the input.

Here's the corrected code for the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function:

```python
@staticmethod
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged) ...

    if not isinstance(c, str) and np.ndim(c) == 2 and np.size(c, 0) == 1:
        c = np.asarray(c)  # Convert to a numpy array
        c = np.tile(c, (xsize, 1))  # Tile the color to match the xsize

    # ... (rest of the code remains unchanged) ...
```

This modification ensures that when a 2D array with a single row is passed as the RGB/RGBA color, it is converted into an array of the required size to ensure that all points have the same color.

After making this correction, the `test_scatter_single_color_c` test should pass without any image comparison failures.
