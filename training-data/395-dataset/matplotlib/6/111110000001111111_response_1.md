The issue seems to be related to how the function `_parse_scatter_color_args` handles the input color values. It is failing to handle the input correctly, resulting in multiple colors being produced for a single RGB/RGBA input.

The issue appears to be in the code segment where the function checks the size of the input color array. It wrongly decides that the input is not intended for mapping and therefore proceeds with treating it as a color specification.

To fix this bug, the function needs to properly handle the case where a single RGB/RGBA color is provided as a 2D array with a single row.

One potential approach for fixing this bug is to properly check the shape of the input color array and treat it as a color-mapping array if it has the same size as the x/y input arrays.

Here is the corrected code for the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function:

```python
@staticmethod
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func):
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolors', None)
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolor', facecolors)
    edgecolors = kwargs.pop('edgecolor', edgecolors)
    
    kwcolor = kwargs.pop('color', None)
    
    if kwcolor is not None and c is not None:
        raise ValueError("Supply a 'c' argument or a 'color'"
                         " kwarg but not both; they differ but"
                         " their functionalities overlap.")
    
    if kwcolor is not None:
        try:
            mcolors.to_rgba_array(kwcolor)
        except ValueError as err:
            raise ValueError(
                "'color' kwarg must be an color or sequence of color "
                "specs.  For a sequence of values to be color-mapped, use "
                "the 'c' argument instead.") from err
        if edgecolors is None:
            edgecolors = kwcolor
        if facecolors is None:
            facecolors = kwcolor
    
    if edgecolors is None and not rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']:
        edgecolors = rcParams['scatter.edgecolors']
    
    c_was_none = c is None
    if c is None:
        c = (facecolors if facecolors is not None
             else "b" if rcParams['_internal.classic_mode']
             else get_next_color_func())
    
    if isinstance(c, (np.ndarray, list)) and len(c) == 1 and len(c[0]) in [3, 4]:
        c = c[0]  # Extracting the color from the 2D array if possible
    
    c_is_string_or_strings = (
        isinstance(c, str)
        or (np.iterable(c) and len(c) > 0
            and isinstance(cbook.safe_first_element(c), str)))
    
    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
```

With this correction, the function should now properly handle the case where a single RGB/RGBA color is provided as a 2D array with a single row, ensuring that all points have the same color as expected.
