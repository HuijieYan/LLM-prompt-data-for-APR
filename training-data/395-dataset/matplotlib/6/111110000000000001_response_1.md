The potential error location within the problematic function is the `invalid_shape_exception` method, as it is being declared within the `_parse_scatter_color_args` method but is not being used or called within the method.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `invalid_shape_exception` method is declared within the `_parse_scatter_color_args` method but is not being used or called anywhere within the `_parse_scatter_color_args` method, which makes it redundant and unnecessary.

To fix the bug, the `invalid_shape_exception` method should either be removed if it is not being used or called elsewhere in the class, or if it is meant to be used, it should be called at the appropriate location within the `_parse_scatter_color_args` method and processed in a way that fulfills its intended purpose.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the function after removing the unnecessary and unused code
