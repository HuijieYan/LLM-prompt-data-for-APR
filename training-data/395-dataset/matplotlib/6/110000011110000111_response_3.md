The error message suggests that there is an issue with the scatter plot producing multiple colors for a single RGB/RGBA input. The test case is trying to compare two scatter plots with different colors and is failing due to image differences.

Based on the error message and the test case, the potential error location within the problematic function is likely the method `_parse_scatter_color_args` that processes the color-related arguments for scatter plots.

The bug occurs because the method is not correctly handling the case where a 2D array with a single row is provided for the `c` argument. This behavior violates the expected outcome, resulting in scatter plots with multiple colors instead of a single color.

To fix this bug, the `_parse_scatter_color_args` method needs to be modified to correctly handle 2D arrays with a single row provided for the `c` argument. The method should ensure that when a 2D array with a single row is passed for the `c` argument, all points should have the same color.

Here's the corrected code for the `_parse_scatter_color_args` method:

```python
@staticmethod
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func):
    # existing code ...

    if c is not None and np.atleast_1d(c).ndim == 2 and np.size(c, 0) == 1:
        c = np.tile(c, (xsize, 1))

    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolors', None)
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolor', facecolors)
    edgecolors = kwargs.pop('edgecolor', edgecolors)

    # existing code ...

    return c, colors, edgecolors
```

In the modified code, we added a condition to check if the `c` argument is not `None` and if it's a 2D array with a single row. If this condition is met, the `c` array is tiled to match the `xsize` of the scatter plot, ensuring that all points have the same color. This modification will address the bug and ensure that scatter plots behave as expected when a 2D array with a single row is provided for the `c` argument.
