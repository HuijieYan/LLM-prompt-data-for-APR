Based on the test case and error message, the bug is likely occurring in the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function, specifically in the handling of single RGB/RGBA color input.

The bug occurs because the function is not correctly handling the case when a single RGB/RGBA color is passed as a 2D array with a single row. This results in the scatter plot elements having multiple different colors instead of the expected single color for all points.

A possible approach to fixing this bug would be to modify the logic that handles the single RGB/RGBA color input to ensure that the scatter plot elements receive the correct color.

Here's the corrected code for the `_parse_scatter_color_args` function:

```python
@staticmethod
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func):
    # Helper function to process color related arguments of `.Axes.scatter`.

    # ... (previous code)

    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolors', None)
    facecolors = kwargs.pop('facecolor', facecolors)
    edgecolors = kwargs.pop('edgecolor', edgecolors)

    kwcolor = kwargs.pop('color', None)

    if kwcolor is not None and c is not None:
        raise ValueError("Supply a 'c' argument or a 'color' kwarg but not both; they differ but their functionalities overlap.")

    if kwcolor is not None:
        try:
            mcolors.to_rgba_array(kwcolor)
        except ValueError as err:
            raise ValueError(
                "'color' kwarg must be a color or sequence of color specs.  For a sequence of values to be color-mapped, use the 'c' argument instead.") from err
        if edgecolors is None:
            edgecolors = kwcolor
        if facecolors is None:
            facecolors = kwcolor

    # New logic to handle single RGB/RGBA color input
    if c is not None and isinstance(c, (list, np.ndarray)) and len(c) == 1 and len(c[0]) in (3, 4):
        c = np.array(c[0])

    # Rest of the previous code

    return c, colors, edgecolors
```

In this corrected code, we added a new logic to check if the `c` input is a single RGB/RGBA color, and if so, we convert it to a numpy array of shape (3,) or (4,) respectively. This ensures that the scatter plot elements will receive the correct single color for all points.

The corrected code should address the bug and produce the expected outcome for the provided test case.
