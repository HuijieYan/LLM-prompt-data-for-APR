The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the `left` and `right` values, as well as the handling of `xmin` and `xmax`.

The bug occurs because the function is not correctly handling the different combinations of input arguments for `left`, `right`, `xmin`, and `xmax`. This results in incorrect x-axis limits being set.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the different combinations of input arguments for `left`, `right`, `xmin`, and `xmax`. Specifically, we need to handle the cases where `left` and `right` are provided as a tuple, as well as properly handle the `xmin` and `xmax` arguments.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def set_xlim(self, left=None, right=None, emit=True, auto=False,
             *, xmin=None, xmax=None):
    """
    Set the x-axis view limits.

    .. ACCEPTS: (left: float, right: float)

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : scalar, optional
        The left xlim in data coordinates. Passing *None* leaves the
        limit unchanged.

    right : scalar, optional
        The right xlim in data coordinates. Passing *None* leaves the
        limit unchanged.

    emit : bool, optional
        Whether to notify observers of limit change (default: True).

    auto : bool or None, optional
        Whether to turn on autoscaling of the x-axis. True turns on,
        False turns off (default action), None leaves unchanged.

    xmin, xmax : scalar, optional
        They are equivalent to left and right respectively,
        and it is an error to pass both *xmin* and *left* or
        *xmax* and *right*.

    Returns
    -------
    left, right : (float, float)
        The new x-axis limits in data coordinates.

    if right is None and isinstance(left, tuple):
        left, right = left

    if xmin is not None:
        if left is not None:
            raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmin` and `left`')
        left = xmin
    if xmax is not None:
        if right is not None:
            raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmax` and `right`')
        right = xmax

    if left is None or right is None:
        old_left, old_right = self.get_xlim()
        if left is None:
            left = old_left
        if right is None:
