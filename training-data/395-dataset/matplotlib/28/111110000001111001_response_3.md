The bug is related to the condition `if right is None and np.iterable(left):` in the `set_xlim` function. The issue arises because `right` is checked before verifying if `left` is iterable, which is incorrect. 

The error occurs when the `right` value is provided as an integer, and the `left` value is provided as an iterable of two elements. In this case, the function incorrectly assumes that `right` is None and attempts to iterate over it, leading to unexpected behavior.

To fix the bug, the condition should be modified to first check if `left` is iterable and `right` is None, instead of the current order. This will ensure that the iterable value of `left` is appropriately handled, and the check for `right` being None is done after this.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_xlim` function:

```python
def set_xlim(self, left=None, right=None, emit=True, auto=False, *, xmin=None, xmax=None):
    """
    Set the x-axis view limits.

    ... (function documentation) ...

    """
    if right is None and left is not None and np.iterable(left):
        left, right = left
    if xmin is not None:
        if left is not None:
            raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmin` and `left`')
        left = xmin
    if xmax is not None:
        if right is not None:
            raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmax` and `right`')
        right = xmax
    # ... (the rest of the function remains unchanged) ...
    return left, right
```
By swapping the order of the condition (checking if `left` is iterable before checking if `right` is None), the bug is resolved and the function will handle the input parameters correctly.
