The error message indicates that the variable `old_left` is being referenced before it's assigned a value. This suggests that the logic for retrieving the old left limit within the `set_xlim` function is flawed.

The potential error location is the conditional block: 
```python
if left is None or right is None:
    old_left, old_right = self.get_xlim()
    if left is None:
        left = old_left
    if right is None:
        right = old_right
```
The issue occurs within the conditional block when trying to retrieve the old left limit if `left` is `None` and referencing `old_left` before it's assigned.

The reason behind this bug is that there is no assignment for `old_left` and `old_right` when `left` and `right` are both not `None`.

One approach to fixing the bug is to ensure that `old_left` and `old_right` are assigned values before within the block of code. This can be achieved by retrieving the old left and right limits unconditionally, and then using them to update `left` and `right` if necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_xlim` function:

```python
def set_xlim(self, left=None, right=None, emit=True, auto=False, *, xmin=None, xmax=None):
    # ... (other parts of the function)

    old_left, old_right = self.get_xlim()

    if right is None and np.iterable(left):
        left, right = left
    if xmin is not None:
        if left is not None:
            raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmin` and `left`')
        left = xmin
    if xmax is not None:
        if right is not None:
            raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmax` and `right`')
        right = xmax

    self._process_unit_info(xdata=(left, right))
    left = self._validate_converted_limits(left, self.convert_xunits)
    right = self._validate_converted_limits(right, self.convert_xunits)

    if left is None:
        left = old_left
    if right is None:
        right = old_right

    # ... (remaining code remains unchanged)
```
The `old_left` and `old_right` are now unconditionally assigned the old left and right limits retrieved using `self.get_xlim()`. This ensures that `old_left` and `old_right` always have a defined value.
