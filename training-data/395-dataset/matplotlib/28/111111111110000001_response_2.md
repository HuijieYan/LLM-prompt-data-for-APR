The error occurs in the `set_xlim` function in the `matplotlib/axes/_base.py` file. 

The error is due to the use of the `old_left` variable before it has been assigned when the x-scale is set to 'log' and `left` is less than or equal to 0. This causes the `left` variable to be reassigned to itself after the warning is issued, leading to the UnboundLocalError because `old_left` was never assigned.

To fix this bug, we can initialize `old_left` and `old_right` to `None` at the beginning of the function, and then only assign them values if `left` or `right` is None. This avoids the UnboundLocalError when the x-scale is 'log' and `left` is less than or equal to 0.

Here's the corrected `set_xlim` function:

```python
def set_xlim(self, left=None, right=None, emit=True, auto=False, *, xmin=None, xmax=None):
    old_left, old_right = None, None  # Initialize old_left and old_right
    
    if right is None and np.iterable(left):
        left, right = left
    if xmin is not None:
        if left is not None:
            raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmin` and `left`')
        left = xmin
    if xmax is not None:
        if right is not None:
            raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmax` and `right`')
        right = xmax

    self._process_unit_info(xdata=(left, right))
    left = self._validate_converted_limits(left, self.convert_xunits)
    right = self._validate_converted_limits(right, self.convert_xunits)

    if left is None or right is None:
        # Axes init calls set_xlim(0, 1) before get_xlim() can be called,
        # so only grab the limits if we really need them.
        temp_left, temp_right = self.get_xlim()
        if left is None:
            old_left = temp_left  # Assign the values only if left is None
            left = temp_left
        if right is None:
            old_right = temp_right  # Assign the values only if right is None
            right = temp_right

    if self.get_xscale() == 'log':
        if left <= 0:
            cbook._warn_external(
                'Attempted to set non-positive left xlim on a '
                'log-scaled axis.\n'
                'Invalid limit will be ignored.')
            left = old_left  # Assign the value of old_left if left is less than or equal to 0
        if right <= 0:
            cbook._warn_external(
                'Attempted to set non-positive right xlim on a '
                'log-scaled axis.\n'
                'Invalid limit will be ignored.')
            right = old_right  # Assign the value of old_right if right is less than or equal to 0
            
    # The rest of the function remains unchanged
```
