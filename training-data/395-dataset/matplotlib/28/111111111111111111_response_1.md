The error message indicates that the variable `old_left` is being referenced before assignment. This means that the variable is being used before it is assigned a value, leading to the `UnboundLocalError` in the function `set_xlim`.

The reason for this bug is that the variable `old_left` is only assigned a value conditionally based on the values of `left` and `right`. If these conditions are not met, the assignment of `old_left` does not occur, leading to the error when it is referenced later in the code.

To fix this bug, we can initialize `old_left` and `old_right` with default values before the conditional checks. This will ensure that they have a value regardless of the conditions, preventing the `UnboundLocalError`.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_xlim` function:

```python
def set_xlim(self, left=None, right=None, emit=True, auto=False,
             *, xmin=None, xmax=None):
    old_left, old_right = self.get_xlim()  # Initialize with default values
    if right is None and np.iterable(left):
        left, right = left
    if xmin is not None:
        if left is not None:
            raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmin` and `left`')
        left = xmin
    if xmax is not None:
        if right is not None:
            raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmax` and `right`')
        right = xmax

    # rest of the code...
```

By initializing `old_left` and `old_right` with default values before the conditional checks, we ensure that they always have a value when referenced later in the code, resolving the `UnboundLocalError` issue.
