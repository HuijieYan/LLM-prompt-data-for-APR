The error message indicates that the variable 'old_left' is being referenced before assignment. This means that the variable is not assigned a value before it is used in the function 'set_xlim'.

The reason for this bug is that in the code block where 'old_left' and 'old_right' are assigned values based on the current limits using 'self.get_xlim()', the assignment of 'old_left' and 'old_right' may not occur if 'left' or 'right' is 'None'.

To fix this bug, we can ensure that the 'old_left' and 'old_right' are always assigned values from 'self.get_xlim()', regardless of whether 'left' or 'right' is 'None'.

Here's the corrected code for the 'set_xlim' function:

```python
def set_xlim(self, left=None, right=None, emit=True, auto=False, *, xmin=None, xmax=None):
    # ... (omitted code)

    if right is None and np.iterable(left):
        left, right = left
    if xmin is not None:
        if left is not None:
            raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmin` and `left`')
        left = xmin
    if xmax is not None:
        if right is not None:
            raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmax` and `right`')
        right = xmax

    self._process_unit_info(xdata=(left, right))
    left = self._validate_converted_limits(left, self.convert_xunits)
    right = self._validate_converted_limits(right, self.convert_xunits)

    # Always get the current limits
    old_left, old_right = self.get_xlim()

    # Handle the case where left or right is None
    if left is None:
        left = old_left
    if right is None:
        right = old_right

    # ... (remaining code)
    
    self.stale = True
    return left, right
```

In the corrected code, 'old_left' and 'old_right' are assigned the current limits using 'self.get_xlim()' regardless of the values of 'left' and 'right'. This ensures that they are always assigned a value before being used within the function.
