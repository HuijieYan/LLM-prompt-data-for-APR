The error message indicates that the variable 'old_left' is being referenced before it's assigned, leading to an 'UnboundLocalError'. This suggests that 'old_left' is being referenced within the 'if' block where it may not have been assigned a value. This points to the potential error location in the section of code where 'old_left' is being used.

The bug occurred because 'old_left' and 'old_right' were being accessed before being assigned within the 'if' block. This can happen when 'left' or 'right' are None and their values are set based on the result of 'self.get_xlim()'.

To fix the bug, the code should be modified to only access 'old_left' and 'old_right' after they have been assigned a value, regardless of the condition. This can be achieved by moving the lines that access 'old_left' and 'old_right' outside of the 'if' block.

Here's the corrected code for the 'set_xlim' function:

```python
def set_xlim(self, left=None, right=None, emit=True, auto=False,
             *, xmin=None, xmax=None):
    if right is None and np.iterable(left):
        left, right = left
    if xmin is not None:
        if left is not None:
            raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmin` and `left`')
        left = xmin
    if xmax is not None:
        if right is not None:
            raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmax` and `right`')
        right = xmax

    self._process_unit_info(xdata=(left, right))
    left = self._validate_converted_limits(left, self.convert_xunits)
    right = self._validate_converted_limits(right, self.convert_xunits)

    # Access old_left and old_right after they have been assigned
    old_left, old_right = self.get_xlim()
    if left is None:
        left = old_left
    if right is None:
        right = old_right

    if self.get_xscale() == 'log':
        if left <= 0:
            cbook._warn_external(
                'Attempted to set non-positive left xlim on a '
                'log-scaled axis.\n'
                'Invalid limit will be ignored.')
            left = old_left
        if right <= 0:
            cbook._warn_external(
                'Attempted to set non-positive right xlim on a '
                'log-scaled axis.\n'
                'Invalid limit will be ignored.')
            right = old_right
    if left == right:
        cbook._warn_external(
            f"Attempting to set identical left == right == {left} results "
            f"in singular transformations; automatically expanding.")
    left, right = self.xaxis.get_major_locator().nonsingular(left, right)
    left, right = self.xaxis.limit_range_for_scale(left, right)

    self._viewLim.intervalx = (left, right)
    if auto is not None:
        self._autoscaleXon = bool(auto)

    if emit:
        self.callbacks.process('xlim_changed', self)
        # Call all of the other x-axes that are shared with this one
        for other in self._shared_x_axes.get_siblings(self):
            if other is not self:
                other.set_xlim(self.viewLim.intervalx,
                               emit=False, auto=auto)
                if other.figure != self.figure:
                    other.figure.canvas.draw_idle()
    self.stale = True
    return left, right
