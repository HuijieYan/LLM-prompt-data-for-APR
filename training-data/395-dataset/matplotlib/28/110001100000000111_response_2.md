The error in the provided code seems to be related to the handling of the `left` and `right` parameters in the `set_xlim` function. The buggy function checks if `right` is None and if `left` is iterable, then unpacks `left` into `left` and `right`. However, there is no check for `right` being an iterable, which can lead to unexpected behavior.

The reason for the bug is that the code does not handle the case where `right` could also be iterable, leading to incorrect unpacking of `left` and `right` values.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to check if `right` is None and if `left` or `right` is iterable, then unpack the values accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_xlim` function:

```python
def set_xlim(self, left=None, right=None, emit=True, auto=False, *, xmin=None, xmax=None):
    """
    Set the x-axis view limits.
    
    ... (rest of the docstring)
    
    """
    if right is None and np.iterable(left):
        if np.iterable(left):
            if len(left) == 2:
                left, right = left
            else:
                raise ValueError('left must be a scalar or length 2 iterable')
    if xmin is not None:
        if left is not None:
            raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmin` and `left`')
        left = xmin
    if xmax is not None:
        if right is not None:
            raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmax` and `right`')
        right = xmax

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

In the corrected code, we added a check to ensure that if `right` is None and `left` is iterable, we unpack the values only if `left` is a length 2 iterable. Additionally, we have handled the `xmin` and `xmax` parameters as before. This should fix the bug and ensure proper handling of the `left` and `right` parameters.
