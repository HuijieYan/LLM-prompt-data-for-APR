The bug occurs in the `set_xlim` function of the `_AxesBase` class. This function takes in parameters `left`, `right`, `emit`, `auto`, `xmin`, and `xmax` to set the x-axis view limits. The bug lies in how the function handles the `left` and `right` parameters.

The function checks if `right` is None and `left` is an iterable. If this condition is met, it tries to unpack the iterable into `left` and `right`, but it doesn't handle the case where `left` is None. Similarly, the function also checks if `xmin` and `xmax` are not None, and if so, overwrites `left` and `right` unconditionally without checking if `left` or `right` were previously set.

To fix the bug, we can remove the check for `right is None` and `np.iterable(left)` and directly unpack the input parameters `left` and `right`. Then, we can handle the cases where `xmin` and `xmax` are provided.

Here's the corrected `set_xlim` function:

```python
def set_xlim(self, left=None, right=None, emit=True, auto=False,
             *, xmin=None, xmax=None):
    
    if left is not None and right is not None:
        # Check if left and right are provided, if so use them
        pass
    elif left is not None and right is None and not np.iterable(left):
        # Only left is provided
        right = left
        left = None
    elif xmin is not None or xmax is not None:
        # Handle cases where xmin and/or xmax are provided
        if xmin is not None and left is not None:
            raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmin` and `left`')
        if xmax is not None and right is not None:
            raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmax` and `right`')
        left = xmin if xmin is not None else left
        right = xmax if xmax is not None else right

    # ... remaining code remains unchanged ...
    
    return left, right
```

With these changes, the function now correctly handles the cases where `left` and `right` are passed as well as the cases involving `xmin` and `xmax`.
