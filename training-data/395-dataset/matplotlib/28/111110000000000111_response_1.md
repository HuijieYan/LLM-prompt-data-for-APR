Potential Error Location:
The error occurs in the main function body, where it incorrectly checks if the `right` parameter is None and if `left` is iterable.

Reasons Behind the Bug:
The bug occurs because the code incorrectly checks if `right` is None and `left` is iterable instead of checking if `left` is iterable and `right` is None.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Swap the condition to check if `left` is iterable and `right` is None instead of checking if `right` is None and `left` is iterable.
2. Additionally, add a check for if `right` is iterable and `left` is None.

Corrected Code:
```python
def set_xlim(self, left=None, right=None, emit=True, auto=False,
                 *, xmin=None, xmax=None):
        """
        Set the x-axis view limits.
        """
        if left is None and np.iterable(right):
            left, right = right
        if right is None and np.iterable(left):
            left, right = left
        if xmin is not None:
            if left is not None:
                raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmin` and `left`')
            left = xmin
        if xmax is not None:
            if right is not None:
                raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmax` and `right`')
            right = xmax
        # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
```
