The error message indicates that the variable `old_left` is being referenced before assignment. This suggests that the `old_left` variable is not being initialized before being used.

The issue occurs because the code attempts to use the `old_left` and `old_right` variables without initializing them in certain conditions. Specifically, when `left` or `right` are `None`, the code attempts to retrieve these values from the `get_xlim()` function without first initializing `old_left` and `old_right`.

To fix this issue, the code should explicitly initialize `old_left` and `old_right` before using them to store the current x-axis limits.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_xlim` function:

```python
def set_xlim(self, left=None, right=None, emit=True, auto=False, *, xmin=None, xmax=None):
    # existing code ...
    
    if left is None or right is None:
        old_left, old_right = self.get_xlim()
        if left is None:
            left = old_left
        if right is None:
            right = old_right

    # existing code ...

    self._viewLim.intervalx = (left, right)
    if auto is not None:
        self._autoscaleXon = bool(auto)

    if emit:
        self.callbacks.process('xlim_changed', self)
        for other in self._shared_x_axes.get_siblings(self):
            if other is not self:
                other.set_xlim(self.viewLim.intervalx, emit=False, auto=auto)
                if other.figure != self.figure:
                    other.figure.canvas.draw_idle()
    self.stale = True
    return left, right
```

In this corrected code, `old_left` and `old_right` are explicitly initialized by calling the `get_xlim()` function before being used. This resolves the issue of referencing variables before assignment.
