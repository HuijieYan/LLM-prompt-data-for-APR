The UnboundLocalError in the `test_log_scales_invalid` function occurs because the variable `old_left` is referenced before it is assigned a value. This is likely due to the condition where `left` and `right` are set to their previous values if they are None, but `old_left` and `old_right` are only assigned values if `left` and `right` are None.

To fix this bug, we can initialize `old_left` and `old_right` to None at the beginning of the `set_xlim` function. This ensures that they always have a value, and the condition checking for None values of `left` and `right` can proceed without causing an UnboundLocalError.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_xlim` function:

```python
def set_xlim(self, left=None, right=None, emit=True, auto=False, *, xmin=None, xmax=None):
    old_left = None
    old_right = None

    if right is None and np.iterable(left):
        left, right = left
    if xmin is not None:
        if left is not None:
            raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmin` and `left`')
        left = xmin
    if xmax is not None:
        if right is not None:
            raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmax` and `right`')
        right = xmax

    self._process_unit_info(xdata=(left, right))
    left = self._validate_converted_limits(left, self.convert_xunits)
    right = self._validate_converted_limits(right, self.convert_xunits)

    # the rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this correction, the UnboundLocalError should no longer occur in the `test_log_scales_invalid` test function.
