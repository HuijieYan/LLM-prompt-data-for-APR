```python
def set_xlim(self, left=None, right=None, emit=True, auto=False,
             *, xmin=None, xmax=None):
    """
    Set the x-axis view limits.
    .. ACCEPTS: (left: float, right: float)

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : scalar, optional
        The left xlim in data coordinates. Passing *None* leaves the
        limit unchanged.

        The left and right xlims may be passed as the tuple
        (*left*, *right*) as the first positional argument (or as
        the *left* keyword argument).

    right : scalar, optional
        The right xlim in data coordinates. Passing *None* leaves the
        limit unchanged.

    emit : bool, optional
        Whether to notify observers of limit change (default: True).

    auto : bool or None, optional
        Whether to turn on autoscaling of the x-axis. True turns on,
        False turns off (default action), None leaves unchanged.

    xmin, xmax : scalar, optional
        They are equivalent to left and right, respectively,
        and it is an error to pass both *xmin* and *left* or
        *xmax* and *right*.

    Returns
    -------
    left, right : (float, float)
        The new x-axis limits in data coordinates.

    See Also
    --------
    get_xlim
    set_xbound, get_xbound
    invert_xaxis, xaxis_inverted

    Notes
    -----
    The *left* value may be greater than the *right* value, in which
    case the x-axis values will decrease from left to right.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> set_xlim(left, right)
    >>> set_xlim((left, right))
    >>> left, right = set_xlim(left, right)

    One limit may be left unchanged.

    >>> set_xlim(right=right_lim)

    Limits may be passed in reverse order to flip the direction of
    the x-axis. For example, suppose *x* represents the number of
    years before present. The x-axis limits might be set like the
    following so 5000 years ago is on the left of the plot and the
    present is on the right.

    >>> set_xlim(5000, 0)
