The error message indicates that the variable `old_left` is referenced before assignment. This suggests that the variable `old_left` is used without being initialized within the function `set_xlim`.

The reason behind the bug is that the variables `old_left` and `old_right` are conditionally initialized within the if statement, but they are also used outside of the if statement. Therefore, there is a possibility that they are not initialized when they are being used outside of the if statement.

To fix this bug, the variables `old_left` and `old_right` need to be assigned initial values before the if statement to ensure that they are always initialized before being used.

Here's the corrected code for the `set_xlim` function:

```python
def set_xlim(self, left=None, right=None, emit=True, auto=False,
             *, xmin=None, xmax=None):
    """
    Set the x-axis view limits.
    """
    old_left, old_right = self.get_xlim()  # initialize old_left and old_right

    if right is None and np.iterable(left):
        left, right = left
    if xmin is not None:
        if left is not None:
            raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmin` and `left`')
        left = xmin
    if xmax is not None:
        if right is not None:
            raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmax` and `right`')
        right = xmax

    self._process_unit_info(xdata=(left, right))
    left = self._validate_converted_limits(left, self.convert_xunits)
    right = self._validate_converted_limits(right, self.convert_xunits)

    if left is None or right is None:
        if left is None:
            left = old_left
        if right is None:
            right = old_right

    # ... rest of the code remains unchanged ...
```

In the corrected code, `old_left` and `old_right` are initialized at the beginning of the function to ensure that they have initial values before being used.
