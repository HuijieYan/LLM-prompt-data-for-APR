The bug in the "set_xlim" method is that it does not properly handle the case when "right" is None and "left" is an iterable object. It tries to unpack the left iterable object into left and right without checking if the unpacking is valid.

This can lead to a TypeError if right is None and left is an iterable object, as it tries to unpack left into left and right without considering the None value for right.

To fix this bug, we can check if right is None and left is an iterable object. If so, we should unpack left into left and right; otherwise, we should handle the other cases as before.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def set_xlim(self, left=None, right=None, emit=True, auto=False,
             *, xmin=None, xmax=None):
    """
    Set the x-axis view limits.

    .. ACCEPTS: (left: float, right: float)

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : scalar, optional
        The left xlim in data coordinates. Passing *None* leaves the
        limit unchanged.

        The left and right xlims may be passed as the tuple
        (*left*, *right*) as the first positional argument (or as
        the *left* keyword argument).

    right : scalar, optional
        The right xlim in data coordinates. Passing *None* leaves the
        limit unchanged.

    emit : bool, optional
        Whether to notify observers of limit change (default: True).

    auto : bool or None, optional
        Whether to turn on autoscaling of the x-axis. True turns on,
        False turns off (default action), None leaves unchanged.

    xmin, xmax : scalar, optional
        They are equivalent to left and right respectively,
        and it is an error to pass both *xmin* and *left* or
        *xmax* and *right*.

    Returns
    -------
    left, right : (float, float)
        The new x-axis limits in data coordinates.
    """

    if right is None:
        if np.iterable(left):
            left, right = left
        else:
            right = self.get_xlim()[1]

    if xmin is not None:
        if left is not None:
            raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmin` and `left`')
        left = xmin
    if xmax is not None:
        if right is not None:
            raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmax` and `right`')
        right = xmax

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this correction, the set_xlim method now properly handles the case when "right" is None and "left" is an iterable object, ensuring that left and right are assigned correctly in all scenarios.
