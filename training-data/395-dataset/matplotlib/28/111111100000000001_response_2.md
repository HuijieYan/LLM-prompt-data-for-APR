The potential error in the buggy function is that it is not properly handling the case when `right` is None and `left` is an iterable. It is assuming that if `right` is None, then `left` would be an iterable, which may not be the case.

The bug occurs because the function is not properly handling multiple scenarios and is not performing the necessary checks to ensure that the input parameters are correct.

One approach to fixing the bug would be to perform proper checks to handle the scenarios where `right` is None and `left` is an iterable. Additionally, the function should check for the cases when `right` or `left` are provided as both positional and keyword arguments.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def set_xlim(self, left=None, right=None, emit=True, auto=False,
             *, xmin=None, xmax=None):
    """
    Set the x-axis view limits.

    .. ACCEPTS: (left: float, right: float)

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : scalar, optional
        The left xlim in data coordinates. Passing *None* leaves the
        limit unchanged.

        The left and right xlims may be passed as the tuple
        (*left*, *right*) as the first positional argument (or as
        the *left* keyword argument).

    right : scalar, optional
        The right xlim in data coordinates. Passing *None* leaves the
        limit unchanged.

    emit : bool, optional
        Whether to notify observers of limit change (default: True).

    auto : bool or None, optional
        Whether to turn on autoscaling of the x-axis. True turns on,
        False turns off (default action), None leaves unchanged.

    xmin, xmax : scalar, optional
        They are equivalent to left and right respectively,
        and it is an error to pass both *xmin* and *left* or
        *xmax* and *right*.

    Returns
    -------
    left, right : (float, float)
        The new x-axis limits in data coordinates.
    
    ...
    (rest of the function remains the same)
    ...
    """

    if right is None and np.iterable(left):
        if len(left) == 2:
            left, right = left
        else:
            raise ValueError('left must be a scalar or a 2-element iterable')

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
