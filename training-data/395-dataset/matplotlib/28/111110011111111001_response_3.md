The potential error location within the problematic function is when the function tries to assign the value of `old_left` to `left` if `left` is found to be None. However, the variable `old_left` is defined and assigned a value only when `left` is found to be None or right is found to be None.

The bug occurs because the variable `old_left` is being referenced before it is assigned a value, which results in an `UnboundLocalError`.

To fix this bug, we can set the initial values of `old_left` and `old_right` to `None`. Then, immediately after the conditional checks for `left` and `right`, we can assign the current limits to `old_left` and `old_right` if they are found to be None. This way, the variables `old_left` and `old_right` will always be defined before being referenced.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def set_xlim(self, left=None, right=None, emit=True, auto=False, *, xmin=None, xmax=None):
    """
    Set the x-axis view limits.

    ... (other docstring content) ...

    """
    old_left, old_right = None, None  # Initialize old_left and old_right

    if right is None and np.iterable(left):
        left, right = left
    if xmin is not None:
        if left is not None:
            raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmin` and `left`')
        left = xmin
    if xmax is not None:
        if right is not None:
            raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmax` and `right`')
        right = xmax

    self._process_unit_info(xdata=(left, right))
    left = self._validate_converted_limits(left, self.convert_xunits)
    right = self._validate_converted_limits(right, self.convert_xunits)

    if left is None or right is None:
        old_left, old_right = self.get_xlim()  # Assign the current limits to old_left and old_right
        if left is None:
            left = old_left
        if right is None:
            right = old_right

    # (remaining implementation remains unchanged)
    # ...
```
By making these changes, we ensure that `old_left` and `old_right` are always defined before they are referenced, fixing the UnboundLocalError.
