The error occurs when trying to set the x-axis limits for a logarithmic scale. The error message specifically points to a `UnboundLocalError: local variable 'old_left' referenced before assignment` in the code.

The issue seems to be that the variable `old_left` is referenced before it is assigned a value. This is likely due to the condition `if left is None or right is None` being True, which triggers a check for `old_left` and `old_right` before they are assigned.

To fix the bug, we can initialize `old_left` and `old_right` with default values of 0 and 1, respectively, before the condition. This way, if the condition is met and `old_left` or `old_right` are not assigned within the condition, they will still have valid initial values.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def set_xlim(self, left=None, right=None, emit=True, auto=False,
             *, xmin=None, xmax=None):
    # ... (existing docstring)

    old_left, old_right = 0, 1  # Initialize with default values
    if left is None or right is None:
        # Axes init calls set_xlim(0, 1) before get_xlim() can be called,
        # so only grab the limits if we really need them.
        old_left, old_right = self.get_xlim()
        if left is None:
            left = old_left
        if right is None:
            right = old_right
    # ... (existing code)
```

By initializing `old_left` and `old_right` with default values, we ensure that they are always assigned before being referenced, fixing the `UnboundLocalError` issue.
