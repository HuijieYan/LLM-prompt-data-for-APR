The bug in the provided code is that the `set_xlim` method is defined twice in the `_AxesBase` class, which is not allowed in Python. The second definition of `set_xlim` is overriding the first one, causing it to only use the parameters `left`, `right`, `emit`, and `auto`, and not the additional `xmin` and `xmax` parameters.

To fix this bug, the second definition of `set_xlim` should be removed, and the code inside that definition should be merged into the first definition. Additionally, the imports for `np` and `cbook` should be included at the beginning of the file.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.cbook as cbook

# class declaration containing the corrected set_xlim method
class _AxesBase(martist.Artist):
    # ... other code ...

    def set_xlim(self, left=None, right=None, emit=True, auto=False,
                 xmin=None, xmax=None):
        """
        Set the x-axis view limits.

        ... (rest of the docstring)

        """
        if right is None and np.iterable(left):
            left, right = left
        if xmin is not None:
            if left is not None:
                raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmin` and `left`')
            left = xmin
        if xmax is not None:
            if right is not None:
                raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmax` and `right`')
            right = xmax

        # ... (rest of the method's code) ...
        # unchanged from the original method

        return left, right
```
