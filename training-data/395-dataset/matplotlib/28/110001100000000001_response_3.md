The potential error in the buggy function is the handling of the `right` parameter and the `np.iterable(left)` condition, which may cause unintended behavior when setting the x-axis view limits.

The problem occurs because the function is designed to handle different ways of passing the left and right limits, but the logic for handling these different cases is not properly implemented. This results in potential conflicts between the `right` parameter and the `np.iterable(left)` condition.

To fix the bug, we can modify the code to handle the different cases of setting the x-axis view limits more clearly and avoid the potential conflicts between the parameters. We can also improve the error checking and handling to ensure that the function behaves as expected in all scenarios.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def set_xlim(self, left=None, right=None, emit=True, auto=False, *, xmin=None, xmax=None):
    """
    Set the x-axis view limits.

    .. ACCEPTS: (left: float, right: float)

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : scalar, optional
        The left xlim in data coordinates. Passing *None* leaves the
        limit unchanged.

        The left and right xlims may be passed as the tuple
        (*left*, *right*) as the first positional argument (or as
        the *left* keyword argument).

    right : scalar, optional
        The right xlim in data coordinates. Passing *None* leaves the
        limit unchanged.

    emit : bool, optional
        Whether to notify observers of limit change (default: True).

    auto : bool or None, optional
        Whether to turn on autoscaling of the x-axis. True turns on,
        False turns off (default action), None leaves unchanged.

    xmin, xmax : scalar, optional
        They are equivalent to left and right respectively,
        and it is an error to pass both *xmin* and *left* or
        *xmax* and *right*.

    Returns
    -------
    left, right : (float, float)
        The new x-axis limits in data coordinates.
    """
    if xmin is not None and left is not None:
        raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmin` and `left`')
    if xmax is not None and right is not None:
        raise TypeError('Cannot pass both `xmax` and `right`')

    if xmin is not None:
        left = xmin
    if xmax is not None:
        right = xmax

    if np.iterable(left):
        left, right = left

    self._process_unit_info(xdata=(left, right))
    left = self._validate_converted_limits(left, self.convert_xunits)
    right = self._validate_converted_limits(right, self.convert_xunits)

    # rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

In this corrected code:
- We first handle the error checking for the cases when both `xmin` and `left` or `xmax` and `right` are passed together, raising an error if this occurs.
- We then check if `xmin` or `xmax` is passed and update the `left` and `right` values accordingly.
- Finally, we handle the case of `np.iterable(left)` more explicitly to ensure that the `left` and `right` values are set correctly based on the input.
