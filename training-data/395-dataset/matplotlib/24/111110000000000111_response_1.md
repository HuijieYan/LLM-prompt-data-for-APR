The issue reported seems to be related to a bug in the matplotlib library, specifically with how heatmaps are being displayed in version 3.1.1 compared to version 3.0.3.

After reviewing the provided function, the potential error is within the `setter` method. The `setter` method contains recursive calls to itself, which can be problematic and lead to unexpected behavior.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the recursive calls in the `setter` method do not have a base case, leading to potential infinite recursion. This could cause the heatmap to be truncated or displayed incorrectly.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to redesign the `setter` method to eliminate the recursive calls and handle the vmin/vmax values appropriately within a single loop or conditional statements.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                new_min = min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)
                new_max = max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)
            else:
                new_min = max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)
                new_max = min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (new_min, new_max))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```

In the corrected code, the `setter` method has been modified to eliminate recursive calls and handle the vmin/vmax values appropriately within conditional statements. This should resolve the potential bug and prevent unexpected behavior in the heatmaps.
