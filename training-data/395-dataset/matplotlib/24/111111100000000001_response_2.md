The potential error in the provided code is the incorrect usage of the `getter` and `setter` functions within the `setter` function. When trying to call the `getter` function within the `setter` function, the code incorrectly tries to use `setter` again, which leads to an infinite recursion and eventually a stack overflow error.

To fix this, we need to use the actual `getter` and `setter` functions that were defined outside of the `_make_getset_interval` function, instead of trying to call `getter` and `setter` within themselves.

Here's the corrected code for the `_make_getset_interval` function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)))
            else:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (max(vmin, vmax, oldmax), min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```

In the corrected code, we simply use `setattr` to set the attribute values directly, without trying to call the `getter` or `setter` functions again. This will prevent the infinite recursion and fix the bug.
