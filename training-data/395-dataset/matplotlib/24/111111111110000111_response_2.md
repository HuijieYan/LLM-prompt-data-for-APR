Analysis:
1. The test case is checking if the x-axis limits are correctly set after inverting the x-axis and setting custom x-axis ticks.
2. The error message indicates that the x-axis limits are not set correctly, showing a mismatch between the expected (1, 0) and the actual (0.7, 0.3) values.

Error Location:
The error is likely located in the `_make_getset_interval` helper function, specifically in the implementation of the `setter` method.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the logic in the `setter` method is incorrect. It should handle the inverted x-axis case properly, but it fails to do so.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the `setter` method to correctly handle the inverted x-axis case.
2. Introduce proper conditional logic to handle the inversion, ensuring that the minimum and maximum limits are set correctly.
