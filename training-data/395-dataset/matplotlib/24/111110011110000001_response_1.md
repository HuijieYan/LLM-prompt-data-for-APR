The error is happening because the `get_xlim()` method is not returning the expected result after calling `ax.invert_xaxis()` and `ax.set_xticks([.3, .7])`. This indicates that the issue is likely in the implementation of the `get_{data,view}_interval` method.

The potential error location within the `_make_getset_interval` function is in the `setter` method. The recursive calls to `setter(self, ...)` are causing infinite recursion, which leads to the incorrect result from `get_xlim()`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that within the `setter` method, the function is calling itself recursively instead of calling the `getter` method to obtain the current limits and then setting the new limits accordingly.

To fix the bug, the `setter` method needs to be modified to call the `getter` method to obtain the current limits, and then set the new limits based on the obtained values.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)))
            else:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (max(vmin, vmax, oldmax), min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```

With this correction, the recursive calls have been replaced with setting the new limits directly, based on the values obtained from the `getter` method. This should fix the infinite recursion and ensure the `get_xlim()` method returns the expected result.
