The issue seems to be related to the bug in the getter and setter functions `_make_getset_interval`. The functions are not implemented correctly and are causing the heatmaps to be truncated.

The reason behind the bug is that the getter and setter functions are incorrectly calling themselves instead of the actual getter and setter methods.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `getter` and `setter` functions are actually calling the methods `getter` and `setter` in the correct context, which is `self`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_make_getset_interval` function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)))
            else:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (max(vmin, vmax, oldmax), min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
``` 

This corrected code ensures that the `getter` and `setter` functions are properly calling the methods `getter` and `setter` with the correct context, `self`.
