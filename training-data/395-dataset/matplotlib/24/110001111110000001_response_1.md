1. The test case `test_set_ticks_inverted` sets x-axis ticks at positions 0.3 and 0.7 and then checks if the x-axis limits are (1, 0), which is expected due to the inversion of the x-axis using `ax.invert_xaxis()`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the `setter` method. It attempts to set the x-axis limits based on the input `vmin` and `vmax` values, but it contains a logical error in how it handles the inversion of the axis.

3. The bug occurs because the `setter` method incorrectly handles the inversion of the axis when determining the new limits based on the input `vmin` and `vmax` values.

4. To fix the bug, we can modify the `setter` method to properly handle the case of an inverted axis. Instead of using recursion to call the `setter` method again, we can directly set the limits based on the input `vmin` and `vmax` values while also considering the inverted axis.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            if vmin < vmax:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
            else:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmax, vmin))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```
