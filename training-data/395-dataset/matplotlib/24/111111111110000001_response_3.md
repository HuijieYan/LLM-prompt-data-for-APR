Potential Error Location: The problem seems to be located in the `_make_getset_interval` function where the `setter` method uses undeclared local functions `getter` and `setter` to recursively call itself, leading to an infinite loop.

Reasons for the Bug: The bug occurs because the `getter` and `setter` methods are being redefined within the `setter` method, creating an infinite recursion loop.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Change the names of the local functions `getter` and `setter` inside the `setter` method to be unique to avoid confusion with the original getter and setter methods.
2. Use fully qualified references to the `getter` and `setter` methods within the `setter` method to avoid inadvertently creating new local functions with the same names.
3. Structure the logic to use the separate `getter` and `setter` methods directly rather than creating new local functions.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def calculate_new_limits(vmin, vmax, oldmin, oldmax):
        return (min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax))

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            new_limits = calculate_new_limits(vmin, vmax, oldmin, oldmax)
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, new_limits)
            self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```
