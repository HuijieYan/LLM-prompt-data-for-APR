The bug is likely related to the getter and setter functions within the `_make_getset_interval` method. The issue description mentions that the very top and bottom of the heatmaps are getting truncated, which suggests that there might be an issue with setting the minimum and maximum values for the plot axes.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `setter` function, specifically when setting the new minimum and maximum values. It seems that the logic for setting the minimum and maximum values based on the `ignore` parameter and the old minimum and maximum values might be incorrect.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely due to incorrect handling of the minimum and maximum values, which results in the top and bottom of the heatmaps being truncated.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to update the logic in the `setter` function to correctly handle the minimum and maximum values based on the `ignore` parameter and the old minimum and maximum values. Additionally, handling the case where `oldmin` is equal to `oldmax` might be necessary to ensure the correct behavior.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                new_min = min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)
                new_max = max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)
            else:
                new_min = max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)
                new_max = min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (new_min, new_max))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```

In the corrected code, the logic for setting the new minimum and maximum values in the `setter` function has been updated to ensure that the correct values are being set based on the `ignore` parameter and the old minimum and maximum values. Additionally, the `self.stale` attribute is updated to reflect the changes.
