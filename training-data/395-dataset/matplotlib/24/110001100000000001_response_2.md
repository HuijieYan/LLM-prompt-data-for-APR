The potential error in the provided code is that the `getter` and `setter` functions are defined inside the `_make_getset_interval` function, but they are not returned by the function, so they are not accessible outside the scope of `_make_getset_interval`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that when trying to call the `getter` and `setter` functions from outside the `_make_getset_interval` function, they are not found because they are limited to the scope of `_make_getset_interval`.

To fix the bug, the `getter` and `setter` functions need to be returned by the `_make_getset_interval` function so that they can be accessed and called outside of it.

Here's the corrected code:
```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate `get_{data,view}_interval` and
    `set_{data,view}_interval` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)  # Updated this line
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                setter(self, min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax),
                       ignore=True)
            else:
                setter(self, max(vmin, vmax, oldmax), min(vmin, vmax, oldmin),
                       ignore=True)
            self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter  # Updated this line
```
