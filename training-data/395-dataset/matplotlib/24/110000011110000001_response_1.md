The error message states that the `assert ax.get_xlim() == (1, 0)` failed, indicating that the `get_xlim` method is returning the wrong result.

The potential error in the problematic function is in the `setter` function. The current implementation of the `setter` function seems to be recursive, but it does not update the `self.stale` attribute, which can cause the incorrect result to be returned by `ax.get_xlim()`.

The bug occurs because the recursive calls to `setter` are actually intended to call the `getter` function to retrieve the oldmin and oldmax values, and then update the limits accordingly. However, the recursive calls should be replaced with a call to `getter`, and then the `setattr` line should be used to update the limits.

To fix the bug, the `setter` function should be modified to properly call the `getter` function to retrieve the oldmin and oldmax values, and then use `setattr` to update the limits. 

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)))
            else:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (max(vmin, vmax, oldmax), min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```
