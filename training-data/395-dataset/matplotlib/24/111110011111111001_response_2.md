The `test_set_ticks_inverted` function is checking if the x-axis limits after inverting are as expected. The bug occurs because the intervals are not being set correctly when the axis is inverted.

The bug is likely located in the `setter` function in the line:
```python
setter(self, max(vmin, vmax, oldmax), min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), ignore=True)
```

The bug occurs because recursion is being used incorrectly, causing the incorrect setting of intervals when the axis is inverted.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `setter` function to directly set the limits based on whether the axis is inverted or not. We can also modify the `getter` function to account for the inverted axis.

Here is the corrected code for the _make_getset_interval function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        if self.get_xscale() == 'linear':
            return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)
        else:
            return tuple(reversed(getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)))

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if self.get_xscale() == 'linear':
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmax, vmin))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```

With the corrected code, the intervals will be set and retrieved correctly even when the axis is inverted, fixing the bug in the test case.
