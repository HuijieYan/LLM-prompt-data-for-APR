The potential error in the `_make_getset_interval` function is that the `getter` and `setter` functions are defined within the scope of `_make_getset_interval` and then returned, but they are not actually assigned to the appropriate methods within the class.

The reason for the bug is that the `getter` and `setter` functions are not being properly assigned to the class methods, so when they are called, they are not found within the class.

To fix the bug, the `getter` and `setter` functions should be assigned to the appropriate methods within the class using the `setattr` function.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                setattr(self.axes, lim_name, (min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)))
            else:
                setattr(self.axes, lim_name, (max(vmin, vmax, oldmax), min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)))
            self.stale = True

    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"
    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    
    setattr(ClassName, f"get_{method_name}_interval", getter)
    setattr(ClassName, f"set_{method_name}_interval", setter)
```

In the corrected code, the `getter` and `setter` functions are assigned to the appropriate class methods using `setattr`. The `getter` and `setter` functions are defined outside the scope of `_make_getset_interval` so that they can be properly accessed and assigned.
