The bug in the provided function _make_getset_interval is likely to be at the setter method. The recursive calls to the setter method seem to be incorrect, and may result in an infinite loop or incorrect behavior.

The bug is likely occurring due to the incorrect recursive call to the setter method within the setter method itself. This can lead to unexpected behavior and potential stack overflow in case of extensive recursion.

To fix the bug, the recursive calls can be replaced with direct calls to the getter and setter methods as appropriate, rather than calling the setter method from within itself.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function _make_getset_interval:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                new_min = min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)
                new_max = max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)
            else:
                new_min = max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)
                new_max = min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)
            
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (new_min, new_max))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```
