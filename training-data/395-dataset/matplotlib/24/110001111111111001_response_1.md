The error message from the `test_set_ticks_inverted` function indicates that the `ax.get_xlim()` returns the tuple (0.7, 0.3) instead of the expected (1, 0).

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `setter` function. The issue arises from the incorrect usage of the `getter` and `setter` functions within the `setter` function itself. Instead of calling the `getter` and `setter` functions directly, new local functions are created using the same names.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `getter` and `setter` functions in the `_make_getset_interval` are called recursively, which results in incorrect handling of the input values.

To fix the bug, we need to use the local `getter` and `setter` functions instead of trying to recursively call the `getter` and `setter` functions.

Here's the corrected code for the `_make_getset_interval` function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (min(vmin, vmax, oldmin), max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)))
            else:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (max(vmin, vmax, oldmax), min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```

In the corrected code, the `getter` and `setter` functions are used directly without trying to call them recursively. Additionally, the implementation of the `setter` function has been modified to correctly update the values of `vmin` and `vmax` based on the condition `oldmin < oldmax`.
