The error occurs when the test case is checking the x-axis limits after setting the x-axis ticks. The error message indicates that the expected result is (1, 0), but the actual result is (0.7, 0.3).

The issue is likely within the `setter` method of the `_make_getset_interval` function. The `setter` function is not implemented correctly, causing the x-axis limits to be set incorrectly when `ax.set_xticks` is called.

The reason for this bug is that the recursive calls to `setter` within the `setter` method are causing the logic to become convoluted and not correctly setting the limits when `ignore` is False.

To fix the bug, the `setter` method should be modified to correctly handle setting the axis limits based on the input `vmin` and `vmax` values. Additionally, the usage of recursive calls to the `setter` method should be replaced with a loop to simplify the logic.

Here's the corrected code for the `_make_getset_interval` function:

```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            oldmin, oldmax = getter(self)
            if oldmin < oldmax:
                new_min = min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)
                new_max = max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)
            else:
                new_min = max(vmin, vmax, oldmax)
                new_max = min(vmin, vmax, oldmin)
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (new_min, new_max))

        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
``` 

With these changes, the bug in setting the axis limits after calling `ax.set_xticks` should be resolved.
