The test case 'test_set_ticks_inverted' appears to be testing the inversion of the x-axis and setting custom tick locations on the inverted x-axis. The error message indicates that there is a mismatch in the expected and actual values of the x-axis limits, which suggests an issue with the 'get_xlim' function.

The issue in the provided function '_make_getset_interval' is with the 'setter' function. The 'getter' and 'setter' functions are not being used correctly. The main issue is the recursive calls to 'setter', which causes an infinite loop and incorrect results. Additionally, the 'setter' function should have direct access to 'getter' and not call it recursively.

An approach to fixing the bug is to modify the 'setter' function to directly use the 'getter' function to obtain the current limits and then set the new limits based on the 'ignore' flag.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _make_getset_interval(method_name, lim_name, attr_name):
    """
    Helper to generate ``get_{data,view}_interval`` and
    ``set_{data,view}_interval`` implementations.
    """

    def getter(self):
        # docstring inherited.
        return getattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name)

    def setter(self, vmin, vmax, ignore=False):
        # docstring inherited.
        current_min, current_max = getter(self)
        if ignore:
            setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (vmin, vmax))
        else:
            new_min = min(vmin, vmax, current_min)
            new_max = max(vmin, vmax, current_max)
            if current_min < current_max:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (new_min, new_max))
            else:
                setattr(getattr(self.axes, lim_name), attr_name, (new_max, new_min))
        self.stale = True

    getter.__name__ = f"get_{method_name}_interval"
    setter.__name__ = f"set_{method_name}_interval"

    return getter, setter
```
