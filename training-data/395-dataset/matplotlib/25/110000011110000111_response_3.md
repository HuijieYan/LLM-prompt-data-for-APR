The error message from the test function indicates that the input array `arr` is being modified in place even though it shouldn't be. This suggests that the bug may be located in the `__init__` method of the `EventCollection` class, where the input data is being processed and potentially modified.

The bug is occurring because the `positions` input is being sorted in-place based on its type (list or ndarray). This causes inconsistency in the behavior of the function, leading to unexpected results.

To fix this issue, we should modify the `__init__` method of the `EventCollection` class to ensure that the input data is always treated consistently, either by sorting both lists and arrays or by leaving them unsorted.

Below is the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `EventCollection` class:

```python
def __init__(self,
             positions,     # Cannot be None.
             orientation=None,
             lineoffset=0,
             linelength=1,
             linewidth=None,
             color=None,
             linestyle='solid',
             antialiased=None,
             **kwargs
             ):
    """
    Parameters
    ----------
    ... (existing documentation remains the same)

    """
    sorted_positions = np.asarray(positions)
    sorted_positions.sort()

    segment = (lineoffset + linelength / 2.,
               lineoffset - linelength / 2.)

    if sorted_positions.size == 0:  # Check if positions is empty
        segments = []
    elif sorted_positions.ndim > 1:  # Check if positions has more than one dimension
        raise ValueError('positions cannot be an array with more than one dimension.')
    elif (orientation is None or orientation.lower() == 'none' or
          orientation.lower() == 'horizontal'):
        segments = [[(coord1, coord2) for coord2 in segment] for
                    coord1 in sorted_positions]
        self._is_horizontal = True
    elif orientation.lower() == 'vertical':
        segments = [[(coord2, coord1) for coord2 in segment] for
                    coord1 in sorted_positions]
        self._is_horizontal = False
    else:
        cbook._check_in_list(['horizontal', 'vertical'],
                             orientation=orientation)

    LineCollection.__init__(self,
                            segments,
                            linewidths=linewidth,
                            colors=color,
                            antialiaseds=antialiased,
                            linestyles=linestyle,
                            **kwargs)

    self._linelength = linelength
    self._lineoffset = lineoffset
```

In the corrected code, we make sure to convert the input `positions` to a NumPy array and then sort it. This ensures that the input data is consistently sorted before further processing, regardless of whether it is a list or an array.
