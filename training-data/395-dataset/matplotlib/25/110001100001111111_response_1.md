The issue occurs because the `positions` array is sorted in-place, which causes the input data to be changed when `positions` is a NumPy array. However, when `positions` is a list, it is not sorted in-place.

To fix this issue, we can modify the function to sort the `positions` array if it is not already sorted, regardless of whether it is a NumPy array or a list. This will ensure consistency in the behavior of the function.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self,
             positions,     # Cannot be None.
             orientation=None,
             lineoffset=0,
             linelength=1,
             linewidth=None,
             color=None,
             linestyle='solid',
             antialiased=None,
             **kwargs
             ):
    """
    Parameters
    ----------
    positions : 1D array-like object
        Each value is an event.

    orientation : {None, 'horizontal', 'vertical'}, optional
        The orientation of the **collection** (the event bars are along
        the orthogonal direction). Defaults to 'horizontal' if not
        specified or None.

    lineoffset : scalar, optional, default: 0
        The offset of the center of the markers from the origin, in the
        direction orthogonal to *orientation*.

    linelength : scalar, optional, default: 1
        The total height of the marker (i.e. the marker stretches from
        ``lineoffset - linelength/2`` to ``lineoffset + linelength/2``).

    linewidth : scalar or None, optional, default: None
        If it is None, defaults to its rcParams setting, in sequence form.

    color : color, sequence of colors or None, optional, default: None
        If it is None, defaults to its rcParams setting, in sequence form.

    linestyle : str or tuple, optional, default: 'solid'
        Valid strings are ['solid', 'dashed', 'dashdot', 'dotted',
        '-', '--', '-.', ':']. Dash tuples should be of the form::

            (offset, onoffseq),

        where *onoffseq* is an even length tuple of on and off ink
        in points.

    antialiased : {None, 1, 2}, optional
        If it is None, defaults to its rcParams setting, in sequence form.

    **kwargs : optional
        Other keyword arguments are line collection properties.  See
        :class:`~matplotlib.collections.LineCollection` for a list of
        the valid properties.
    """
    
    # Ensure that positions is in the form of an array
    positions = np.asarray(positions)
    # Sort the positions array
    positions = np.sort(positions)
    
    segment = (lineoffset + linelength / 2.,
               lineoffset - linelength / 2.)
    
    # Rest of the code remains unchanged

```

This modification ensures that the `positions` array is always sorted before further processing, addressing the inconsistency in behavior based on the type of input data.
