The bug seems to be related to the sorting of the `positions` parameter. When the `positions` parameter is passed as a numpy array, it gets sorted in-place. However, when it is passed as a list, it doesn't get sorted.

The error location is in the `__init__` method of the `eventplot` function where the `positions` parameter is being sorted.

The reason for this bug is that the code explicitly sorts the `positions` array if it is of type numpy array, but does not do so for a list. This inconsistency leads to unexpected behavior and confusion for the user.

To fix the bug, it would be better to handle both numpy arrays and lists in a consistent manner. Either always sort the `positions` parameter or don't sort it at all. The preference of the user in the GitHub issue is to leave the data unsorted, so this approach should be taken into consideration.

Here is the corrected code for the `eventplot` function:

```python
def __init__(self,
             positions,     # Cannot be None.
             orientation=None,
             lineoffset=0,
             linelength=1,
             linewidth=None,
             color=None,
             linestyle='solid',
             antialiased=None,
             **kwargs
             ):
    """
    [Previous docstring...]

    """

    segment = (lineoffset + linelength / 2.,
               lineoffset - linelength / 2.)
    if positions is None or len(positions) == 0:
        segments = []
    else:
        if hasattr(positions, 'ndim') and positions.ndim > 1:
            raise ValueError('positions cannot be an array with more than '
                             'one dimension.')

        # Sort the positions
        positions = sorted(positions)

        if (orientation is None or orientation.lower() == 'none' or
                orientation.lower() == 'horizontal'):
            segments = [[(coord1, coord2) for coord2 in segment] for
                        coord1 in positions]
            self._is_horizontal = True
        elif orientation.lower() == 'vertical':
            segments = [[(coord2, coord1) for coord2 in segment] for
                        coord1 in positions]
            self._is_horizontal = False
        else:
            cbook._check_in_list(['horizontal', 'vertical'],
                                 orientation=orientation)

    LineCollection.__init__(self,
                            segments,
                            linewidths=linewidth,
                            colors=color,
                            antialiaseds=antialiased,
                            linestyles=linestyle,
                            **kwargs)

    self._linelength = linelength
    self._lineoffset = lineoffset
```

In the corrected code, I added a section to sort the `positions` parameter before processing it. This ensures that the behavior is consistent whether the `positions` parameter is a numpy array or a list.
