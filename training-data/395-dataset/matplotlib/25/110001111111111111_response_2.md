The test case `test_EventCollection_nosort` checks if the `positions` array passed into the `EventCollection` class function is being sorted in place. The error message indicates that the input array is being modified in place, contrary to the expected behavior.

The potential error location is within the initialization of the `EventCollection` class, where the input array `positions` is being sorted.

The bug occurs because the `positions` array is being sorted in place when it should remain unsorted to maintain consistency. This sorting behavior differs based on the type of input (np.array or list). This inconsistency causes unexpected behavior and fails the test case.

One possible approach to fix this bug is to create a copy of the `positions` array at the beginning of the `EventCollection` initialization, instead of sorting it in place. This ensures that the original array remains unmodified.

Here's the corrected code for the `EventCollection` class function:

```python
def __init__(self,
             positions,     # Cannot be None.
             orientation=None,
             lineoffset=0,
             linelength=1,
             linewidth=None,
             color=None,
             linestyle='solid',
             antialiased=None,
             **kwargs
             ):
    """
    Parameters
    ----------
    positions : 1D array-like object
        Each value is an event.

    orientation : {None, 'horizontal', 'vertical'}, optional
        The orientation of the **collection** (the event bars are along
        the orthogonal direction). Defaults to 'horizontal' if not
        specified or None.

    lineoffset : scalar, optional, default: 0
        The offset of the center of the markers from the origin, in the
        direction orthogonal to *orientation*.

    linelength : scalar, optional, default: 1
        The total height of the marker (i.e. the marker stretches from
        ``lineoffset - linelength/2`` to ``lineoffset + linelength/2``).

    linewidth : scalar or None, optional, default: None
        If it is None, defaults to its rcParams setting, in sequence form.

    color : color, sequence of colors or None, optional, default: None
        If it is None, defaults to its rcParams setting, in sequence form.

    linestyle : str or tuple, optional, default: 'solid'
        Valid strings are ['solid', 'dashed', 'dashdot', 'dotted',
        '-', '--', '-.', ':']. Dash tuples should be of the form::

            (offset, onoffseq),

        where *onoffseq* is an even length tuple of on and off ink
        in points.

    antialiased : {None, 1, 2}, optional
        If it is None, defaults to its rcParams setting, in sequence form.

    **kwargs : optional
        Other keyword arguments are line collection properties.  See
        :class:`~matplotlib.collections.LineCollection` for a list of
        the valid properties.

    Examples
    --------

    .. plot:: gallery/lines_bars_and_markers/eventcollection_demo.py
    """

    # Create a copy of the positions array to avoid modifying the input in-place
    positions = np.array(positions, copy=True)

    segment = (lineoffset + linelength / 2.,
               lineoffset - linelength / 2.)
    
    # Rest of the function remains the same
    ...
```
By creating a copy of the `positions` array, the original array is preserved and not sorted in place, ensuring consistent behavior regardless of the input type.
