The bug is that the positions array is being sorted in-place in the `EventCollection` class when it is passed as a numpy array, but not when it is passed as a list. This behavior is inconsistent and can lead to unexpected results for users.

The potential error location within the code is the conditional statement that checks whether the positions array is None or has more than one dimension. This conditional statement does not handle the case where the positions array is a list, leading to the inconsistency in sorting behavior.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the code only checks for None or multi-dimensional arrays but does not handle the case of a 1D array-like object being represented as a list.

To fix this bug, we can modify the conditional statement to handle cases where the positions array is a list. We should check if the positions array is an instance of ndarray, and if not, we should convert it to a numpy array before sorting.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `EventCollection` class:

```python
def __init__(self,
             positions,     # Cannot be None.
             orientation=None,
             lineoffset=0,
             linelength=1,
             linewidth=None,
             color=None,
             linestyle='solid',
             antialiased=None,
             **kwargs
             ):
    """
    Parameters
    ----------
    ...
    """

    segment = (lineoffset + linelength / 2.,
               lineoffset - linelength / 2.)

    if np.ndim(positions) > 1:
        raise ValueError('positions cannot be an array with more than one dimension.')

    positions = np.asarray(positions)  # Ensure positions is a numpy array
    positions.sort()

    if orientation is None or orientation.lower() == 'none' or orientation.lower() == 'horizontal':
        segments = [[(coord1, coord2) for coord2 in segment] for coord1 in positions]
        self._is_horizontal = True
    elif orientation.lower() == 'vertical':
        segments = [[(coord2, coord1) for coord2 in segment] for coord1 in positions]
        self._is_horizontal = False
    else:
        cbook._check_in_list(['horizontal', 'vertical'], orientation=orientation)

    LineCollection.__init__(self,
                            segments,
                            linewidths=linewidth,
                            colors=color,
                            antialiaseds=antialiased,
                            linestyles=linestyle,
                            **kwargs)

    self._linelength = linelength
    self._lineoffset = lineoffset
    ```

With this modification, the positions array is converted to a numpy array and then sorted regardless of whether it is passed as a list or a numpy array, ensuring consistent behavior.
