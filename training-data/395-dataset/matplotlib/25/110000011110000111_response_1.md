The error occurs in the `test_EventCollection_nosort` function, where the `arr` array is expected to remain unsorted after being passed to the `EventCollection` constructor. However, the array is getting sorted in place, leading to a failed assertion when comparing the original array with the sorted array.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional sorting of the `positions` array when it's a numpy array.

The reason behind the bug is that the `positions` array is being sorted in place when it's a numpy array, but it's not being sorted when it's a list. This inconsistency leads to unexpected behavior in the test case.

To fix the bug, you should ensure that the `positions` array is not modified in place, regardless of whether it is a numpy array or a list.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def __init__(self,
             positions,     # Cannot be None.
             orientation=None,
             lineoffset=0,
             linelength=1,
             linewidth=None,
             color=None,
             linestyle='solid',
             antialiased=None,
             **kwargs
             ):
    """
    Parameters
    ----------
    ... (same as before)
    """

    # Make a sorted copy of the positions array if it's a numpy array
    if isinstance(positions, np.ndarray):
        positions = np.sort(positions)

    segment = (lineoffset + linelength / 2.,
               lineoffset - linelength / 2.)
    if positions is None or len(positions) == 0:
        segments = []
    elif hasattr(positions, 'ndim') and positions.ndim > 1:
        raise ValueError('positions cannot be an array with more than '
                         'one dimension.')
    elif (orientation is None or orientation.lower() == 'none' or
          orientation.lower() == 'horizontal'):
        positions.sort()
        segments = [[(coord1, coord2) for coord2 in segment] for
                    coord1 in positions]
        self._is_horizontal = True
    elif orientation.lower() == 'vertical':
        positions.sort()
        segments = [[(coord2, coord1) for coord2 in segment] for
                    coord1 in positions]
        self._is_horizontal = False
    else:
        cbook._check_in_list(['horizontal', 'vertical'],
                             orientation=orientation)

    LineCollection.__init__(self,
                            segments,
                            linewidths=linewidth,
                            colors=color,
                            antialiaseds=antialiased,
                            linestyles=linestyle,
                            **kwargs)

    self._linelength = linelength
    self._lineoffset = lineoffset
```

By making a sorted copy of the positions array if it's a numpy array without modifying the original array, the corrected function ensures that the input array remains unmodified, as expected in the test case.
