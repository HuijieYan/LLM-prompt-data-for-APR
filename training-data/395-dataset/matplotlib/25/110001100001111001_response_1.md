The bug in the provided function is that the 'positions' array is not being sorted correctly before being used in the calculation of 'segments'. This means that the start and end points of the segments are not being calculated properly.

To fix this bug, the 'positions' array should be sorted before calculating the 'segments'. Additionally, 'segment' should be calculated using the sorted 'positions' array.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def __init__(self,
             positions,
             orientation=None,
             lineoffset=0,
             linelength=1,
             linewidth=None,
             color=None,
             linestyle='solid',
             antialiased=None,
             **kwargs
             ):
    segment = (lineoffset + linelength / 2., lineoffset - linelength / 2.)
    if positions is None or len(positions) == 0:
        segments = []
    elif hasattr(positions, 'ndim') and positions.ndim > 1:
        raise ValueError('positions cannot be an array with more than one dimension.')
    else:
        positions = np.sort(positions)  # Sort the positions array
        if orientation is None or orientation.lower() == 'horizontal':
            segments = [[(coord1, segment[0]), (coord1, segment[1])] for coord1 in positions]
            self._is_horizontal = True
        elif orientation.lower() == 'vertical':
            segments = [[(segment[0], coord1), (segment[1], coord1)] for coord1 in positions]
            self._is_horizontal = False
        else:
            raise ValueError('Invalid orientation value')

    LineCollection.__init__(self, segments, linewidths=linewidth, colors=color, antialiaseds=antialiased, linestyles=linestyle, **kwargs)

    self._linelength = linelength
    self._lineoffset = lineoffset
```

In this corrected code, the 'positions' array is sorted using `np.sort()` before calculating the 'segments'. Depending on the orientation, the segments are calculated using the sorted positions and the correct segment calculations are stored in the 'segments' variable.

This fix ensures that the segments are correctly calculated and stored based on the sorted positions, and the orientation is handled appropriately.
