The bug seems to be related to the `EventCollection` class, which is used in the `test_EventCollection_nosort` test function. 

Looking at the error message, it's clear that the `EventCollection` function is sorting the input array `arr`. The test function is then checking whether `arr` is sorted or not. Since the input to `EventCollection` is an array, it's being sorted in place by the `EventCollection` function, leading to the failure of the test.

To fix this bug, the `EventCollection` function should not modify the input array `positions` in place. It should create a copy of the positions array and sort the copy instead.

Here's the corrected code for the `EventCollection` function:

```python
class EventCollection(LineCollection):
    # ... other code ...

    def __init__(self,
                 positions,      
                 orientation=None,
                 lineoffset=0,
                 linelength=1,
                 linewidth=None,
                 color=None,
                 linestyle='solid',
                 antialiased=None,
                 **kwargs
                 ):
        if isinstance(positions, np.ndarray):
            positions = positions.copy()
        else:
            positions = np.array(positions)
        
        positions.sort()
        
        # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this modification, the `positions` array will be sorted inside the `EventCollection` function without affecting the original input array, resolving the bug described in the GitHub issue.
