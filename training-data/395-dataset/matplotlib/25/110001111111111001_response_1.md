The test case `test_EventCollection_nosort` creates an array `arr` with elements [3, 2, 1, 10], then creates an `EventCollection` object with this array. After that, it checks whether the original array `arr` has been modified or not. The expected behavior is that `arr` should remain unchanged after creating the `EventCollection` object.

The bug is located in the `__init__` method of the `EventCollection` class. In the `__init__` method, the `positions` array is being modified in place. It sorts the original `positions` array and assigns it back to the same variable, thereby modifying the array in place.

The reason behind the bug occurring is that the `positions` array is being sorted in the `__init__` method, which modifies the original input array. This behavior contradicts the expected behavior described in the test case.

To fix the bug, a copy of the `positions` array should be sorted within the `__init__` method, rather than modifying the original array in place.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `EventCollection` class:

```python
def __init__(self, positions, orientation=None, lineoffset=0, linelength=1, linewidth=None, color=None, linestyle='solid', antialiased=None, **kwargs):
        """
        Parameters
        ----------
        positions : 1D array-like object
            Each value is an event.
        ...
        Examples
        ...
        """
        segment = (lineoffset + linelength / 2., lineoffset - linelength / 2.)
        
        # Create a sorted copy of the positions array to avoid modifying the original array
        sorted_positions = np.sort(positions)
        
        if positions is None or len(positions) == 0:
            segments = []
        elif hasattr(positions, 'ndim') and positions.ndim > 1:
            raise ValueError('positions cannot be an array with more than one dimension.')
        elif (orientation is None or orientation.lower() == 'none' or orientation.lower() == 'horizontal'):
            segments = [[(coord1, coord2) for coord2 in segment] for coord1 in sorted_positions]
            self._is_horizontal = True
        elif orientation.lower() == 'vertical':
            segments = [[(coord2, coord1) for coord2 in segment] for coord1 in sorted_positions]
            self._is_horizontal = False
        else:
            cbook._check_in_list(['horizontal', 'vertical'], orientation=orientation)

        LineCollection.__init__(self, segments, linewidths=linewidth, colors=color, antialiaseds=antialiased, linestyles=linestyle, **kwargs)

        self._linelength = linelength
        self._lineoffset = lineoffset
```

By creating a sorted copy of the `positions` array and using the sorted copy within the method instead of the original array, we prevent modification of the original input array and address the bug.
