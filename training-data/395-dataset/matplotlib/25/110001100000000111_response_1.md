Upon analyzing the GitHub issue, it appears that the bug is related to the `eventplot` function sorting the data if it's passed as a numpy array, but not sorting the data if it's passed as a list. The bug seems to be occurring in the `__init__` method of the `LineCollection` class in the `matplotlib.collections` module.

The reason behind the bug is that the `positions` data is being sorted before processing when it is passed as a numpy array. However, when it is passed as a list, it is not being sorted, leading to inconsistent behavior.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `__init__` method to always sort the `positions` data before processing, regardless of whether it is passed as a numpy array or a list. This will ensure consistent behavior and avoid unexpected results for users.

Here is the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `LineCollection` class:

```python
def __init__(self,
             positions,     # Cannot be None.
             orientation=None,
             lineoffset=0,
             linelength=1,
             linewidth=None,
             color=None,
             linestyle='solid',
             antialiased=None,
             **kwargs
             ):
    """
    Parameters
    ----------
    positions : 1D array-like object
        Each value is an event.

    orientation : {None, 'horizontal', 'vertical'}, optional
        The orientation of the **collection** (the event bars are along
        the orthogonal direction). Defaults to 'horizontal' if not
        specified or None.

    lineoffset : scalar, optional, default: 0
        The offset of the center of the markers from the origin, in the
        direction orthogonal to *orientation*.

    linelength : scalar, optional, default: 1
        The total height of the marker (i.e. the marker stretches from
        ``lineoffset - linelength/2`` to ``lineoffset + linelength/2``).

    linewidth : scalar or None, optional, default: None
        If it is None, defaults to its rcParams setting, in sequence form.

    color : color, sequence of colors or None, optional, default: None
        If it is None, defaults to its rcParams setting, in sequence form.

    linestyle : str or tuple, optional, default: 'solid'
        Valid strings are ['solid', 'dashed', 'dashdot', 'dotted',
        '-', '--', '-.', ':']. Dash tuples should be of the form::

            (offset, onoffseq),

        where *onoffseq* is an even length tuple of on and off ink
        in points.

    antialiased : {None, 1, 2}, optional
        If it is None, defaults to its rcParams setting, in sequence form.

    **kwargs : optional
        Other keyword arguments are line collection properties.  See
        :class:`~matplotlib.collections.LineCollection` for a list of
        the valid properties.
    """

    positions = np.array(positions)  # Convert to numpy array to ensure consistency

    positions.sort()  # Always sort positions before processing

    segment = (lineoffset + linelength / 2.,
               lineoffset - linelength / 2.)

    if positions.size == 0:
        segments = []
    else:
        if positions.ndim > 1:
            raise ValueError('positions cannot be an array with more than one dimension.')
            
        if (orientation is None or orientation.lower() == 'none' or
             orientation.lower() == 'horizontal'):
            segments = [[(coord1, coord2) for coord2 in segment] 
                        for coord1 in positions]
            self._is_horizontal = True
        elif orientation.lower() == 'vertical':
            segments = [[(coord2, coord1) for coord2 in segment]
                        for coord1 in positions]
            self._is_horizontal = False
        else:
            cbook._check_in_list(['horizontal', 'vertical'],
                                orientation=orientation)

    LineCollection.__init__(self,
                            segments,
                            linewidths=linewidth,
                            colors=color,
                            antialiaseds=antialiased,
                            linestyles=linestyle,
                            **kwargs)

    self._linelength = linelength
    self._lineoffset = lineoffset
```

This corrected code ensures that the `positions` data is always sorted before processing, regardless of its original type. This will provide consistent behavior for the `eventplot` function, addressing the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
