The issue seems to be related to how the `eventplot` function handles input data. When the input data is an array, it gets sorted, but when it's a list, it remains unsorted. This behavior is causing inconsistency and unexpected results.

The potential error location within the `EventCollection` class is in the `__init__` method where the positions are sorted under certain conditions. This sorting behavior is problematic because it modifies the input data in place, which is unexpected for the users.

The reason behind the bug is that the `eventplot` function modifies the input data in place by sorting it if it's a numpy array, leading to inconsistent behavior.

To fix the bug, the sorting behavior should be generalized. Instead of modifying the input data in place, a copy of the input data should be sorted for consistency. This change ensures that the original input data remains unmodified, regardless of whether it's a list or a numpy array.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method in the `EventCollection` class:

```python
def __init__(self,
             positions,     # Cannot be None.
             orientation=None,
             lineoffset=0,
             linelength=1,
             linewidth=None,
             color=None,
             linestyle='solid',
             antialiased=None,
             **kwargs
             ):
    # ... omitted code ...
    # Make a copy of positions to avoid modifying the input data
    positions = np.array(positions)
    segment = (lineoffset + linelength / 2.,
               lineoffset - linelength / 2.)
    if positions.size == 0:
        segments = []
    elif (orientation is None or orientation.lower() == 'none' or
          orientation.lower() == 'horizontal'):
        positions.sort()
        segments = [[(coord1, coord2) for coord2 in segment] for
                    coord1 in positions]
        self._is_horizontal = True
    elif orientation.lower() == 'vertical':
        positions.sort()
        segments = [[(coord2, coord1) for coord2 in segment] for
                    coord1 in positions]
        self._is_horizontal = False
    else:
        cbook._check_in_list(['horizontal', 'vertical'],
                             orientation=orientation)

    LineCollection.__init__(self,
                            segments,
                            linewidths=linewidth,
                            colors=color,
                            antialiaseds=antialiased,
                            linestyles=linestyle,
                            **kwargs)

    self._linelength = linelength
    self._lineoffset = lineoffset
```

In the corrected code, we first make a copy of the input positions using `np.array(positions)` to avoid modifying the original input. Then, the rest of the logic remains the same, ensuring that the original input data remains unmodified, regardless of the data type (list or numpy array).
