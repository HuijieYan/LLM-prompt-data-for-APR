1. The test case is trying to create a scatter plot with markers that are unfilled. It then checks for the properties of the scatter plot collection such as facecolors, edgecolors, and linewidths.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is around the logic for handling unfilled markers and the colors associated with it.

3. The error message indicates that the expected shape of facecolors is (0, 4), meaning there should be no facecolors, but the actual shape returned is (3, 4), indicating there are facecolors present.

4. The bug is likely occurring because the logic for handling unfilled markers and facecolors is incorrect. It seems that the function is trying to handle unfilled markers but is not properly removing the facecolors or setting them to an empty array as expected.

5. Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    # ... (previous code)

    # Process **kwargs to handle aliases, conflicts with explicit kwargs:
    self._process_unit_info(xdata=x, ydata=y, kwargs=kwargs)
    x = self.convert_xunits(x)
    y = self.convert_yunits(y)

    # ... (remaining code)

    if c is not None and cbook.is_numlike(c) and edgecolors is 'face':
        edgecolors = None  # Set edgecolors to None for unfilled markers

    scales = s

    # ... (remaining code)

    # Classic mode only:
    # ... (remaining code)
    
    self.add_collection(collection)
    self._request_autoscale_view()

    return collection
```

In the corrected code, when the condition `c is not None and cbook.is_numlike(c) and edgecolors is 'face'` is met, the edgecolors are set to None. This ensures that for unfilled markers, the facecolors are effectively removed and the error mentioned in the test case is resolved.
