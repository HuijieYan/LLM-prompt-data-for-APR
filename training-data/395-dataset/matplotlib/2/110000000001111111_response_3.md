The bug is likely located in the section of the code where the marker is processed. The user is reporting that they are trying to make a custom marker hollow by using the `fillstyle='none'`, but it seems that it's not being processed correctly. 

The reason behind the bug could be that the current implementation of the `scatter` method does not handle the `fillstyle` parameter correctly when a custom `markers.MarkerStyle` is used.

To fix this issue, it's necessary to ensure that the custom `markers.MarkerStyle` is correctly processed, taking into account the `fillstyle='none'` parameter. This may require adjusting how the marker is being applied and how the `fillstyle` parameter is being handled.

Here's the corrected code for the `scatter` method:

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    """
    A scatter plot of *y* vs. *x* with varying marker size and/or color.
    
    (The rest of the method implementation remains the same as in the original code)

    Returns
    -------
    `~matplotlib.collections.PathCollection`
    
    (The remaining part of the method implementation remains the same as in the original code)

    """
    # (The rest of the method implementation remains the same as in the original code)

    path = None
    if isinstance(marker, mmarkers.MarkerStyle):
        path = marker.get_path().transformed(marker.get_transform())
    else:
        path = mmarkers.MarkerStyle(marker).get_path().transformed(
            mmarkers.MarkerStyle(marker).get_transform()
        )
        
    if not mmarkers.MarkerStyle(marker).is_filled():
        edgecolors = 'none'

    # (The rest of the method implementation remains the same as in the original code)
    
    return collection
```

In this corrected code, we are ensuring that the `fillstyle` parameter is correctly processed when a custom `markers.MarkerStyle` is used. This should address the issue reported by the user about the markers not being hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `fillstyle` to 'none'.
