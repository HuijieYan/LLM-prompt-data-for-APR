The bug occurs in the `scatter` method of a class where the `edgecolors` are set to 'face' when the marker is not filled. This behavior seems to conflict with the expected behavior mentioned in the issue, where the user wants to set markers as hollow.

The issue description indicates that the user tried to set the `fillstyle` of the marker to 'none' using a custom `markers.MarkerStyle`. However, the scatter plot does not reflect this setting.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to handle the `fillstyle='none'` correctly when setting up the markers for scatter plots.

The corrected code for the `scatter` method is as follows:

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    # ... (previous code remains the same)
    
    if not marker_obj.is_filled():
        # Set `edgecolors` to 'none' when the marker is not filled and fillstyle is 'none'
        edgecolors = 'none' if marker_obj.get_fillstyle() == 'none' else 'face'
        if linewidths is None:
            linewidths = rcParams['lines.linewidth']
        elif np.iterable(linewidths):
            linewidths = [
                lw if lw is not None else rcParams['lines.linewidth']
                for lw in linewidths]
    
    # ... (previous code remains the same)
    
    return collection
```

In this corrected code, the `edgecolors` for markers that are not filled and have `fillstyle` as 'none' are set to 'none'. This allows the user to create hollow markers as intended.
