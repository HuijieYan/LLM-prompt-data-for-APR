The error message indicates that the `get_facecolors()` method of the `coll` object returns an array of shape (3, 4) instead of the expected (0, 4). This suggests that the facecolors are being set when they should not be, and the current scatter implementation is not properly handling the case where `facecolors` should be empty for unfilled markers.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the `scatter` method where the `facecolors` are being determined and applied to the collection. It seems that this portion of the code is not properly handling the case when `facecolors` should be empty for unfilled markers.

The bug occurs because the given implementation of the `scatter` method does not properly handle the `fillstyle='none'` argument when setting up the scatter plot.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `scatter` method so that it correctly handles the `fillstyle='none'` argument and ensures that the facecolors are not set for unfilled markers.

Here's the corrected code for the `scatter` method:

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    """
    A scatter plot of *y* vs. *x* with varying marker size and/or color.

    ... (rest of the docstring remains unchanged) ...

    """

    # ... (rest of the method remains unchanged) ...

    if not marker_obj.is_filled():
        # Handle case when marker is not filled
        facecolors = 'none'
        edgecolors = edgecolors if edgecolors is not None else rcParams['scatter.edgecolors']
        linewidths = linewidths if linewidths is not None else rcParams['lines.linewidth']
    else:
        facecolors = colors

    # ... (rest of the method remains unchanged) ...

    collection = mcoll.PathCollection(
            (path,), scales,
            facecolors=facecolors,
            edgecolors=edgecolors,
            linewidths=linewidths,
            offsets=offsets,
            transOffset=kwargs.pop('transform', self.transData),
            alpha=alpha
            )

    # ... (rest of the method remains unchanged) ...

    return collection
```

In the corrected code, we added a condition to handle the case when the marker is not filled. If the marker is not filled, we set `facecolors` to 'none' and use the specified `edgecolors` and `linewidths`. Otherwise, we use the computed `colors` as the `facecolors`. This change ensures that the `facecolors` are correctly handled for unfilled markers, addressing the bug in the original implementation.
