The bug seems to be in the `scatter` method of the `Axes` class. The issue is related to the `edgecolors` parameter, which is used to set the edge color of the marker, and the `fillstyle` parameter of `MarkerStyle`, which is supposed to set the marker as hollow.

The issue occurs because the `edgecolors` parameter in the `scatter` method is overridden and set to 'face', which causes the markers to be filled. This overrides the `fillstyle` parameter set in the `MarkerStyle` instance.

To fix this bug, the `edgecolors` parameter should be handled differently to allow the `fillstyle` parameter of the `MarkerStyle` to take effect. This could involve modifying how the `edgecolors` parameter is processed and used within the `scatter` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `scatter` method:

```python
# this is the corrected scatter function
@_preprocess_data(replace_names=["x", "y", "s", "linewidths",
                                 "edgecolors", "c", "facecolor",
                                 "facecolors", "color"],
                  label_namer="y")
@cbook._delete_parameter("3.2", "verts")
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    """
    A scatter plot of *y* vs. *x* with varying marker size and/or color.

    ... (the rest of the docstring remains the same)

    """

    # Existing code remains the same up to this point

    if not np.iterable(edgecolors):
        if edgecolors is not None:
            edgecolors = [edgecolors]
    else:
        if len(edgecolors) == x.size:
            edgecolors = list(edgecolors)  # edgecolors passed as a scalar or string
        else:
            edgecolors = np.asarray(edgecolors)  # edgecolors as an array will go through the colormapping as well

    c, colors, _ = self._parse_scatter_color_args(
        c, edgecolors, kwargs, x.size,
        get_next_color_func=self._get_patches_for_fill.get_next_color)

    # Remaining code remains the same
```

In the corrected code, the `edgecolors` parameter is validated to check for its iterability. If it's not iterable, it is treated as a single color. If it is iterable, then its length is checked against the number of data points to decide which elements should be treated as individual edge colors.

This fix ensures that the `edgecolors` parameter can coexist with the `fillstyle` parameter of the `MarkerStyle` and correctly represent the edge colors for each marker. With this change, using `fillstyle='none'` in `MarkerStyle` should work as expected when used with the `scatter` method.
