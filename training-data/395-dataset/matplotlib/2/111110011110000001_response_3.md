The error message indicates that the `assert` statement in the test function is failing because the shape of the facecolors retrieved from the scatter plot collection (`coll.get_facecolors().shape`) is not matching the expected shape of `(0, 4)`.

Upon carefully inspecting the `scatter` function, it seems that the line `edgecolors = 'face'` inside the `scatter` function might be causing the issue. This line ensures that the edge color will always be the same as the face color and is applicable when the marker style is unfilled.

The issue is likely occurring because the edge color is being set to 'face' at this stage, which is causing incorrect values to be returned when trying to retrieve the facecolors. This could be causing the discrepancy in the array shape.

To fix this issue, we should remove or modify the line `edgecolors = 'face'` and any related logic that sets the edge color based on the face color. By doing this, we can ensure that the facecolor and edgecolor attributes are handled correctly based on the input parameters.

Here is the corrected `scatter` function:

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    # ... (existing code) ...

    if marker is None:
        marker = rcParams['scatter.marker']

    if isinstance(marker, mmarkers.MarkerStyle):
        marker_obj = marker
    else:
        marker_obj = mmarkers.MarkerStyle(marker)

    path = marker_obj.get_path().transformed(
        marker_obj.get_transform())
    if not marker_obj.is_filled():
        # Remove the line that sets the edgecolors to 'face'
        if linewidths is None:
            linewidths = rcParams['lines.linewidth']
        elif np.iterable(linewidths):
            linewidths = [
                lw if lw is not None else rcParams['lines.linewidth']
                for lw in linewidths]

    offsets = np.ma.column_stack([x, y])

    collection = mcoll.PathCollection(
            (path,), scales,
            facecolors=colors,
            edgecolors=edgecolors,  # Update to use the provided edgecolors
            linewidths=linewidths,
            offsets=offsets,
            transOffset=kwargs.pop('transform', self.transData),
            alpha=alpha
            )
    collection.set_transform(mtransforms.IdentityTransform())
    collection.update(kwargs)

    if colors is None:
        collection.set_array(c)
        collection.set_cmap(cmap)
        collection.set_norm(norm)
        collection._scale_norm(norm, vmin, vmax)

    # ... (existing code) ...

    return collection
```

By removing the line that sets `edgecolors` to 'face' and using the provided `edgecolors` parameter instead, we address the potential issue with retrieving the facecolors and ensure that the scatter plot collection is created and configured correctly.
