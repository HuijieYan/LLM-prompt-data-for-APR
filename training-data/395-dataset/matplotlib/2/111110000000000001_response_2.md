The potential error in the provided function is that the `_parse_scatter_color_args` and `get_next_color` functions are defined within the `Axes` class, but these are being called without the `self` parameter, meaning they should be instance methods.

The bug occurred because when a method is called within a class, it needs to have `self` as the first parameter to work with the instance's data. In this case, the `_parse_scatter_color_args` and `get_next_color` functions are being called without the `self` parameter, so they cannot access the instance's data and other methods.

To fix the bug, these two functions should be defined as instance methods by including the `self` parameter as the first argument within the `Axes` class. This will allow them to access and modify the instance's data and other methods.

Here's the corrected code for the `scatter` function with the instance methods and function calls fixed:

```python
# corrected function
class Axes(_AxesBase):
    # ... omitted code ...
    
    def _parse_scatter_color_args(self, c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def get_next_color(self):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    @_preprocess_data(replace_names=["x", "y", "s", "linewidths",
                                     "edgecolors", "c", "facecolor",
                                     "facecolors", "color"],
                      label_namer="y")
    @cbook._delete_parameter("3.2", "verts")
    def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
                vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
                verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
                **kwargs):
        """
        (remaining function code...)
        """
        c, colors, edgecolors = \
            self._parse_scatter_color_args(
                c, edgecolors, kwargs, x.size,
                get_next_color_func=self.get_next_color)

        # (remaining function code...)
```

The corrected code defines the `_parse_scatter_color_args` and `get_next_color` functions as instance methods within the `Axes` class, allowing them to properly access the instance's data and other methods. Now the `scatter` function can call these instance methods in a way that aligns with the intended behavior of the code.
