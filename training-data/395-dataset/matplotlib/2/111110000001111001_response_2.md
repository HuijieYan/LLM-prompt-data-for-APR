The error seems to be caused by the usage of 'c' as a string array in the input, while the function expects it to be an array of floats.

The bug occurs because the input argument 'c' is expected to be an array of colors, but it is passed as a list of strings, which leads to the problem in the function.

To fix this bug, we need to convert the input 'c' from a list of strings to an array of floats before processing it further in the function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    """
    A scatter plot of *y* vs. *x* with varying marker size and/or color.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : float or array-like, shape (n, )
        The data positions.
    
    s : float or array-like, shape (n, ), optional
        The marker size in points**2.
        Default is ``rcParams['lines.markersize'] ** 2``.
    
    c : array-like or list of colors or color, optional
        The marker colors. Possible values:
        
        - A scalar or sequence of n numbers to be mapped to colors using
          *cmap* and *norm*.
          
        - A 2-D array in which the rows are RGB or RGBA.
        
        - A sequence of colors of length n.
        
        - A single color format string.
        
        Note that *c* should not be a single numeric RGB or RGBA sequence
        because that is indistinguishable from an array of values to be
        colormapped. If you want to specify the same RGB or RGBA value for
        all points, use a 2-D array with a single row. Otherwise, value-
        matching will have precedence in case of a size matching with *x*
        and *y*.
        
        If you wish to specify a single color for all points
        prefer the *color* keyword argument.
        
        Defaults to `None`. In that case the marker color is determined
        by the value of *color*, *facecolor* or *facecolors*. In case
        those are not specified or `None`, the marker color is determined
        by the next color of the ``Axes``' current "shape and fill" color
        cycle. This cycle defaults to :rc:`axes.prop_cycle`.
        
    marker : `~.markers.MarkerStyle`, default: :rc:`scatter.marker`
        The marker style. *marker* can be either an instance of the class
        or the text shorthand for a particular marker.
        See :mod:`matplotlib.markers` for more information about marker
        styles.
        
    ... rest of the function remains the same ...
    """
    # ... previous code up to the point of the bug ...

    # Convert input 'c' to an array of floats
    c = [float(item) for item in c]

    # ... remaining code ...
```

By converting the input 'c' to an array of floats within the function, we ensure that the function works correctly and does not encounter errors related to the input data types.
