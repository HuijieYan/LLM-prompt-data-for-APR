The error message indicates that the `assert` statement `coll.get_facecolors().shape == (0, 4)` is failing because the shape of `coll.get_facecolors()` is `(3, 4)` instead of `(0, 4)` as expected. This means that `coll.get_facecolors()` is not returning an empty array as it should for unfilled markers.

The potential error location within the `scatter` function is the handling of unfilled markers when `marker=mmarkers.MarkerStyle('o', fillstyle='none')` is used.

The issue occurs because the implementation does not correctly handle the case of unfilled markers. Instead of returning an empty facecolors array, the current implementation returns a non-empty array.

To fix the bug, the code must be modified to correctly handle unfilled markers. This can be achieved by checking if the marker is unfilled and then not setting the facecolors, or setting it explicitly to an empty array.

Here's the corrected code for the `scatter` function:

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    # Existing implementation

    # ... (previous implementation)

    if not marker_obj.is_filled():
        edgecolors = 'face'
        if linewidths is None:
            linewidths = rcParams['lines.linewidth']
        elif np.iterable(linewidths):
            linewidths = [
                lw if lw is not None else rcParams['lines.linewidth']
                for lw in linewidths]
        facecolors = np.array([])
    else:
        facecolors = colors

    path = marker_obj.get_path().transformed(
        marker_obj.get_transform())
    offsets = np.column_stack([x, y])

    collection = mcoll.PathCollection(
        [path], scales, edgecolors=edgecolors,
        facecolors=facecolors, linewidths=linewidths,
        offsets=offsets,
        transOffset=kwargs.pop('transform', self.transData),
        alpha=alpha)
    # ... (remaining implementation)
    return collection
```

With this corrected code, the condition `if not marker_obj.is_filled():` checks if the marker is unfilled, and in that case, the facecolors are explicitly set to an empty array. This change will ensure that unfilled markers are represented correctly, resolving the issue identified in the test case.
