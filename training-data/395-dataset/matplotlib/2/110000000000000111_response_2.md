Potential error location within the problematic function:
The error may be related to the handling of the fillstyle parameter in the scatter method. The code in the scatter method should handle the fillstyle parameter for creating hollow markers, but it seems to be missing or not functioning correctly.

Reason behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug may be occurring because the fillstyle parameter is not being handled properly in the scatter method. This could be leading to the markers not being rendered as hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the fillstyle parameter is being properly processed in the scatter method.
2. Ensure that the MarkerStyle object is created and used correctly to handle the fillstyle parameter and render the markers as hollow.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.cbook as cbook
import matplotlib.collections as mcoll
import matplotlib.markers as mmarkers
import matplotlib.transforms as mtransforms
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from matplotlib import rcParams

def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None, 
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None, edgecolors=None, 
            *, plotnonfinite=False, **kwargs):
    """
    A scatter plot of *y* vs. *x* with varying marker size and/or color.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : float or array-like, shape (n, )
        The data positions.
    ... (other parameters remain unchanged)

    Returns
    -------
    `~matplotlib.collections.PathCollection`

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    **kwargs : `~matplotlib.collections.Collection` properties

    See Also
    --------
    plot : To plot scatter plots when markers are identical in size and
        color.
    ... (other information remains unchanged)
    """
    # Process **kwargs to handle aliases, conflicts with explicit kwargs:

    # (existing code remains unchanged)

    # Check if marker is None or a MarkerStyle object
    if marker is None:
        marker = rcParams['scatter.marker']

    if isinstance(marker, mmarkers.MarkerStyle):
        marker_obj = marker
    else:
        # Create MarkerStyle object with fillstyle='none'
        marker_obj = mmarkers.MarkerStyle(marker=marker, fillstyle='none')

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged
```

In the corrected code, the scatter method has been updated to properly handle the marker and fillstyle parameters, ensuring that the markers are rendered as hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.
