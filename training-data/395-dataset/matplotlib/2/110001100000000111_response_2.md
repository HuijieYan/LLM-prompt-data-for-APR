The issue reported on GitHub regarding the markers not being hollow when using ax.scatter() and setting markers.MarkerStyle()'s fillstyle to 'none' seems to be related to a potential bug in the scatter() method of Matplotlib.

The potential error location within the scatter() method is likely when the marker style is being processed and set. The bug may be occurring due to the fact that the scatter() method does not properly handle the fillstyle parameter of the MarkerStyle when creating the marker object.

To fix this bug, the scatter() method needs to properly process the fillstyle parameter when creating the marker object. This would involve checking the value of the fillstyle parameter and appropriately setting the edgecolors to 'face' if fillstyle is 'none', indicating a hollow marker.

The corrected code for the scatter() method in the Matplotlib source code is as follows:

```python
# Relative function's signature in this file
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    """
    A scatter plot of *y* vs. *x* with varying marker size and/or color.

    ... (other parameters documentation remains the same)

    """

    # ... (existing code remains the same)

    if isinstance(marker, mmarkers.MarkerStyle):
        marker_obj = marker
    else:
        marker_obj = mmarkers.MarkerStyle(marker)
        if marker == 'none':
            edgecolors = 'face'

    # ... (remaining code remains the same)

    return collection
```

In this corrected code, we added an additional condition to check if the marker style is set to 'none', in which case we set the edgecolors to 'face' to create a hollow marker. This should fix the reported issue with markers not being hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.
