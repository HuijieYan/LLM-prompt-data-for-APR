The error message suggests that the shape of the `facecolors` attribute of the `scatter` collection (`coll.get_facecolors().shape`) is expected to be (0, 4), but it is actually (3, 4). This indicates that `facecolors` are being set when it should not be set, leading to an incorrect assertion in the test.

The potential error location within the `scatter` function is when the `PathCollection` is created using the `mmarkers.MarkerStyle('o', fillstyle='none')` which specifies an unfilled marker. In this case, the `facecolors` should not be set and should be left as the default, which is None, but it seems that it's being set to some value leading to a non-empty shape. 

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `facecolors` of the `PathCollection` are not set when the marker is unfilled.

Here's the corrected code for the `scatter` function:

```python
# fixed function
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    # ... (other code remains the same) ...

    # rest of the function remains unchanged

    if not marker_obj.is_filled():  # Check if the marker is unfilled
        edgecolors = 'face'  # Set edge colors to 'face' for unfilled marker
        facecolors = 'none'  # Set facecolors to 'none' for unfilled marker
        if linewidths is None:  # Provide a default linewidth if not specified
            linewidths = rcParams['lines.linewidth']
        elif np.iterable(linewidths):  # Ensure linewidths is an iterable
            linewidths = [
                lw if lw is not None else rcParams['lines.linewidth']
                for lw in linewidths]
    else:  # If marker is filled
        facecolors = colors  # Use the specified colors as facecolors
```
