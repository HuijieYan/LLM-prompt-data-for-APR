### Bug Analysis

The issue seems to be related to the marker style not being set correctly when using `ax.scatter()`. The user is trying to create a custom marker style with `fillstyle='none'`, but it doesn't seem to have the desired effect.

### Potential Error Location
The issue seems to be related to how the marker style is being processed within the `scatter` method of the provided function.

### Reason for the Bug
The bug might be due to the mishandling of the marker style parameters within the scatter method, leading to the fillstyle not being set as expected.

### Possible Approaches
1. Check how the marker style is being processed within the scatter method and ensure that the `fillstyle` parameter is being correctly propagated to the marker style.
2. Verify if the custom marker style is being applied correctly to the scatter plot.

### Corrected Code
```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    # ... (omitted code)

    # Rest of the implementation remains the same
    # Ensure that the custom marker style is correctly applied to the scatter plot
    if isinstance(marker, markers.MarkerStyle):
        marker_obj = marker
    else:
        marker_obj = markers.MarkerStyle(marker)
        if 'fillstyle' in kwargs:
            marker_obj._fillstyle = kwargs.pop('fillstyle')

    # ... (omitted code)
```
In the corrected code, we modify the `scatter` method to correctly handle the custom marker style and ensure that the `fillstyle` parameter is processed and applied to the marker style. This modification should address the issue with the markers not being hollow as expected.
