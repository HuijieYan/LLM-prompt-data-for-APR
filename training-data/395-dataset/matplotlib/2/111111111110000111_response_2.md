The test case `test_scatter_unfilled` is trying to create a scatter plot with unfilled markers, but the assertion `assert coll.get_facecolors().shape == (0, 4)` fails, indicating that the markers are not hollow as expected. The error message points to the discrepancy in the shape of the facecolors attribute of the collection.

The potential error location within the `scatter` function is the transformation of edgecolors to 'face' when the markers are not filled. This could be causing the markers to appear filled instead of hollow.

The bug occurs because in the scatter function, the edgecolors of the markers are transformed to 'face' when they should be left unchanged to maintain the hollow appearance of the markers.

To fix the bug, the scatter function should be modified to handle the fillstyle argument properly and preserve the 'face' edgecolors when the marker is not filled.

Here is the corrected code for the scatter function:

```python
# ... (other code)

def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    """
    A scatter plot of *y* vs. *x* with varying marker size and/or color.

    Parameters
    ----------
    x, y : float or array-like, shape (n, )
        The data positions.

    # ... (other parameter descriptions)

    """
    # ... (other code)

    if marker is None:
        marker = rcParams['scatter.marker']

    if isinstance(marker, mmarkers.MarkerStyle):
        marker_obj = marker
    else:
        marker_obj = mmarkers.MarkerStyle(marker)

    path = marker_obj.get_path().transformed(
        marker_obj.get_transform())
    if not marker_obj.is_filled():
        facecolors = 'none'  # Setting facecolors to 'none' for unfilled markers.

    offsets = np.ma.column_stack([x, y])

    collection = mcoll.PathCollection(
            (path,), scales,
            facecolors=facecolors,  # Assigning 'none' to facecolors for unfilled markers.
            edgecolors=edgecolors,
            linewidths=linewidths,
            offsets=offsets,
            transOffset=kwargs.pop('transform', self.transData),
            alpha=alpha
            )
    
    # ... (other code)
```

In the corrected scatter function, when the marker is not filled, the facecolors are explicitly set to 'none', preserving the hollow appearance of the markers as intended.

With this fix, the issue reported in the GitHub bug should be resolved, and the markers will appear hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `markers.MarkerStyle()`'s fillstyle to 'none'.
