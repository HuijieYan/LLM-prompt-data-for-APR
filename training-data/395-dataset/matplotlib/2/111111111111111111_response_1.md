The error occurs when trying to assert that the shape of the face colors of the scatter plot collection is (0, 4), indicating no face colors. However, the actual shape is (3, 4), which means there are face colors present.

Looking at the code, the issue seems to be in the `scatter` method. Specifically, the problem arises in the following lines:
```python
marker=mmarkers.MarkerStyle('o', fillstyle='none')
```
This line creates a MarkerStyle with 'o' marker and 'none' fillstyle, indicating that the markers should be hollow. However, it appears that this particular configuration is not being processed correctly, leading to filled markers instead of hollow ones.

To fix this issue, it's necessary to ensure that the MarkerStyle with 'none' fillstyle is properly processed and results in hollow markers in the scatter plot collection.

Here's the corrected code for the `scatter` method:

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    """
    A scatter plot of *y* vs. *x* with varying marker size and/or color.

    ... [other parts of the method]

    """
    # ... [previous code remains the same]

    if marker is None:
        marker = 'o'

    path = None
    if marker is not None:
        if isinstance(marker, mmarkers.MarkerStyle):
            marker_obj = marker
        else:
            marker_obj = mmarkers.MarkerStyle(marker, fillstyle='none')  # Set fillstyle to 'none' for hollow markers

        path = marker_obj.get_path().transformed(
            marker_obj.get_transform())
        if not marker_obj.is_filled():
            edgecolors = 'face'
            if linewidths is None:
                linewidths = rcParams['lines.linewidth']
            elif np.iterable(linewidths):
                linewidths = [
                    lw if lw is not None else rcParams['lines.linewidth']
                    for lw in linewidths]

    # ... [continue with the rest of the method as it is]

    self.add_collection(collection)
    self._request_autoscale_view()

    return collection
```
In the corrected code, if the marker is not specified, it defaults to 'o' marker. When creating the MarkerStyle object, the `fillstyle` is explicitly set to 'none' to ensure the markers are hollow. After making these changes, the scatter plot should properly display hollow markers when using 'none' fillstyle.
