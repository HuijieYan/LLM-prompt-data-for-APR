The test case `test_scatter_unfilled` is checking the behavior of the `scatter` function when creating an unfilled scatter plot. It sets marker edges with different colors and verifies if `get_facecolors().shape` is `(0, 4)` indicating no face colors are set, as well as checks the edge colors and linewidths.

The error message indicates that the assertion `assert coll.get_facecolors().shape == (0, 4)` failed because the actual shape returned is `(3, 4)` which means that it's not correctly handling the absence of face colors for the markers.

The potential error location within the `scatter` function is likely in the section where it handles unfilled markers and sets edge colors.

The bug occurs because the code does not correctly handle the case for unfilled markers when setting the edge colors and handling the absence of face colors.

The possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the code in the `scatter` function to correctly handle unfilled markers by not setting the face colors and only setting the edge colors as specified in the test case.

Here's the corrected code for the `scatter` function:

```python
def _parse_scatter_color_args(self, c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def get_next_color(self):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    """
    A scatter plot of *y* vs. *x* with varying marker size and/or color.

    ... (other documentation remains the same)

    """

    # Process **kwargs to handle aliases, conflicts with explicit kwargs:

    self._process_unit_info(xdata=x, ydata=y, kwargs=kwargs)
    x = self.convert_xunits(x)
    y = self.convert_yunits(y)

    # Handle unfilled markers
    if isinstance(marker, mmarkers.MarkerStyle) and not marker.is_filled():
        edgecolors = c

    # ... (other unchanged code)

    # Create collection as before
    collection = mcoll.PathCollection(
            (path,), scales,
            facecolors=None,  # Set facecolors as None for unfilled marker
            edgecolors=edgecolors,
            linewidths=linewidths,
            offsets=offsets,
            transOffset=kwargs.pop('transform', self.transData),
            alpha=alpha
            )

    # ... (other unchanged code)

    self.add_collection(collection)
    self._request_autoscale_view()

    return collection
```

In the corrected code, when handling unfilled markers, we explicitly set `facecolors=None` for unfilled markers, and we maintain the provided `edgecolors`. This addresses the issue with setting face and edge colors for unfilled markers and should resolve the test case failure.
