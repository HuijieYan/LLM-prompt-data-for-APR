The test case `test_scatter_unfilled` is checking if the `facecolors` of the scatter plot collection are of shape (0, 4) when markers are not filled. However, it is failing with an AssertionError because the value is (3, 4) instead of (0, 4).

The potential error location within the function is the assignment of `edgecolors = 'face'` when `marker_obj` is not filled.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that when the markers are not filled, the edge and face colors should be the same, and `edgecolors = 'face'` should result in no edge colors. However, the function is not handling this correctly.

To fix the bug, the code should be updated to assign `edgecolors` to have the same value as `colors` when markers are not filled.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/matplotlib_2/lib/matplotlib/axes/_axes.py

# Import necessary libraries
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.markers as mmarkers
import matplotlib.collections as mcoll
import matplotlib.transforms as mtransforms
import matplotlib.cbook as cbook
from matplotlib import rcParams

# relative function's signature in this file
def _parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, xsize, get_next_color_func):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def get_next_color():
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# Updated and corrected scatter function
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    """
    A scatter plot of *y* vs. *x* with varying marker size and/or color.
    """
    # ... old code ...

    # Existing code ...

    if not marker_obj.is_filled():
        edgecolors = colors
    
    # Remaining code remains the same
```

By assigning `edgecolors` to have the same value as `colors` when the marker is not filled, the bug is fixed. This change ensures that the edge and face colors are consistent when the markers are not filled.
