The error message asserts that the shape of `coll.get_facecolors()` should be (0, 4), but it actually returns (3, 4). This suggests that the facecolors are not being set correctly when initializing the collection in the `scatter` function.

The potential error location within the `scatter` function is in the chunk of code where the collection is initialized and its properties such as facecolors, edgecolors, and linewidths are being set.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the facecolors are not being properly handled when creating the scatter plot, which results in the incorrect shape being returned by `coll.get_facecolors()`.

To fix this bug, the 'scatter' function needs to correctly handle the 'fillstyle' parameter when initializing the collection, ensuring that the facecolors are set properly for unfilled markers.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    """
    A scatter plot of *y* vs. *x* with varying marker size and/or color.
    Parameters
    ----------
    ... (rest of the function remains the same)
    """
    
    # ... (previous code remains the same)
    
    # Ensure that the facecolors are correctly handled for unfilled markers
    if marker and isinstance(marker, mmarkers.MarkerStyle) and not marker.is_filled():
        colors = c
        facecolors = 'none'  # Set facecolors to 'none' for unfilled markers
    else:
        colors, edgecolors = self._parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, x.size, get_next_color_func=self._get_patches_for_fill.get_next_color)
        facecolors = colors

    # ... (continuation of the function remains the same)
```

In the corrected code, we have added a conditional check to handle the 'fillstyle' of the marker. If the marker is unfilled, then we set the facecolors to 'none' and retain the edgecolors as calculated. Otherwise, we proceed with the normal handling of facecolors and edgecolors. This ensures that the facecolors are set correctly for unfilled markers, and the test case should pass without any assertion errors.
