The potential error in the code is that the decorator "@_preprocess_data" and the decorator "@cbook._delete_parameter" are improperly used or not defined within the provided code.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the decorators are not defined or used incorrectly, resulting in a syntax error.

To fix the bug, the decorators need to be defined properly or removed from the code if they are not necessary for the function.

Corrected code:

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    """
    A scatter plot of *y* vs. *x* with varying marker size and/or color.

    ... (rest of the function remains the same)
    """

    # rest of the function remains the same
```
