Potential Error Location: The error seems to be related to the shape of the facecolors after creating the scatter plot. The assert statement is checking for the shape of the facecolors array, but it is not matching the expected shape.

Reason for Bug: The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of the facecolors when creating the scatter plot. It seems that the facecolors array is not being properly initialized or updated, leading to the unexpected shape.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug: 
1. Check the handling of facecolors within the scatter function to ensure that it is initialized properly and updated according to the input parameters.
2. Verify the logic for setting the facecolors array based on the input data and marker style.
3. Ensure that the facecolors array matches the expected shape before returning the collection.

Corrected Code:

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    # ... (omitted code)

    c, colors, edgecolors = self._parse_scatter_color_args(c, edgecolors, kwargs, x.size,
                                                           get_next_color_func=get_next_color)

    # ... (omitted code)

    if not marker_obj.is_filled():
        # for unfilled markers, use edgecolors as facecolors and update edgecolors
        colors = edgecolors
        edgecolors = 'face'

    # ... (omitted code)

    collection = mcoll.PathCollection(
        (path,), scales,
        facecolors=colors,  # use colors as facecolors
        edgecolors=edgecolors,
        linewidths=linewidths,
        offsets=offsets,
        transOffset=kwargs.pop('transform', self.transData),
        alpha=alpha
    )

    # ... (omitted code)

    return collection
```

In the corrected code, the facecolors array is set to use the `colors` variable, which is determined based on the input and marker style. This ensures that the facecolors array matches the expected shape, addressing the issue with the test case.
