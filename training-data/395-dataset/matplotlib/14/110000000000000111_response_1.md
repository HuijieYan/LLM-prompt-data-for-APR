Potential error location: The error seems to be related to the order in which the arguments "size" and "fontproperties" are passed to the `plt.ylabel` function. It appears that the "size" argument is being ignored when placed before "fontproperties".

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug: The bug is likely occurring because the `update` function is not handling the "size" and "fontproperties" arguments in the correct order.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug: The `update` function should be modified to handle the "size" and "fontproperties" arguments in the correct order, ensuring that both arguments are properly processed.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def update(self, kwargs):
    # docstring inherited
    # Update bbox last, as it depends on font properties.
    sentinel = object()  # bbox can be None, so use another sentinel.
    bbox = kwargs.pop("bbox", sentinel)
    size = kwargs.pop("size", None)  # extract the "size" argument
    fontproperties = kwargs.pop("fontproperties", None)  # extract the "fontproperties" argument
    super().update(kwargs)
    if fontproperties is not None:  # set fontproperties first
        self.set_fontproperties(fontproperties)
    if size is not None:  # set size next
        self.set_size(size)
    if bbox is not sentinel:
        self.set_bbox(bbox)
```
