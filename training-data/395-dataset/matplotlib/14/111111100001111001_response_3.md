The buggy function `update` has the following issues:
1. It is trying to pop the "bbox" key from the `kwargs` dictionary without checking if it exists, which can raise a KeyError if "bbox" is not present.
2. It calls `self.set_bbox(bbox)` without explicitly passing the bbox argument.

To fix the issues, we need to modify the `update` function as follows:

```python
def update(self, kwargs):
    bbox = kwargs.pop("bbox", None)  # Use None as default value if "bbox" is not present
    super().update(kwargs)
    if bbox is not None:  # Check if bbox is not None before calling set_bbox
        self.set_bbox(bbox)
```

This updated function will first check if the "bbox" key is present in the `kwargs` dictionary. If it is present, it will pop the value associated with the key. Then, it will call the `super().update(kwargs)` method to update other properties. Finally, it will check if the `bbox` is not None before calling `self.set_bbox(bbox)`. This ensures that the `set_bbox` method is only called if the `bbox` value exists.
