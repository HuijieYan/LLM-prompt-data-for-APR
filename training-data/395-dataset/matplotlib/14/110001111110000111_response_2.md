1. The test case is comparing the font size of text elements created using `plt.xlabel` and `plt.ylabel`. The error message indicates that the font size for `text2` does not match the expected value.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the calculation or application of the font size, especially when fontproperties are specified before or after the size.

3. The bug occurs because the font size provided as a keyword argument is not properly applied when fontproperties are specified before or after the size. This indicates that the function `update` within the `Text` class is not correctly handling the font size when fontproperties are present.

4. To fix the bug, the `update` method needs to correctly handle the font size when fontproperties are specified. This may involve ensuring that the font size is applied correctly regardless of the order in which fontproperties and size are specified.

5. Below is the corrected `update` method:

```python
def update(self, kwargs):
    # docstring inherited
    # Update bbox last, as it depends on font properties.
    sentinel = object()  # bbox can be None, so use another sentinel.
    bbox = kwargs.pop("bbox", sentinel)
    fontproperties = kwargs.pop("fontproperties", None)
    size = float(kwargs.pop("size", 12.0))  # Default font size
    super().update(kwargs)
    if bbox is not sentinel:
        self.set_bbox(bbox)
    if fontproperties:
        self.set_fontproperties(fontproperties)
    self.set_fontsize(size)
```

In the corrected `update` method, the `fontproperties` and `size` are extracted from the `kwargs` and applied using the `set_fontproperties` and `set_fontsize` methods respectively. This ensures that the font size is correctly handled regardless of the order in which fontproperties and size are specified.
