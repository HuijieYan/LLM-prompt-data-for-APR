The problem with the provided code is that the `update` function is trying to access the `set_bbox` function from the `self` object, but it is incorrectly being defined as taking a parameter `rectprops`.

To fix this issue, the `update` function needs to be updated to remove the `rectprops` parameter and directly use the `bbox` value from `kwargs`.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def update(self, kwargs):
    # docstring inherited
    # Update bbox last, as it depends on font properties.
    sentinel = object()  # bbox can be None, so use another sentinel.
    bbox = kwargs.pop("bbox", sentinel)
    super().update(kwargs)
    if bbox is not sentinel:
        self.set_bbox(bbox)
```

With this correction, the `update` function will correctly update the bbox based on the values provided in the `kwargs` dictionary.
