The issue with the provided function is that the `update` function is taking a `self` parameter which indicates that it's a method of a class. However, it doesn't seem to be a method as it doesn't use any attributes or properties of the class. Additionally, it seems that the function is trying to update the attributes of a `Text` object, but it's not implemented correctly.

To fix this issue, the following changes need to be made:
1. Remove the `self` parameter from the function definition.
2. Use the `Text` object directly inside the function to update its attributes.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def update(kwargs, text_obj):
    sentinel = object()
    bbox = kwargs.pop("bbox", sentinel)
    if bbox is not sentinel:
        text_obj.set_bbox(bbox)
```

You can use this function by passing the `kwargs` and the `Text` object that you want to update. For example:
```python
update({'fontsize': 'medium', 'fontweight': 'normal'}, text_object)
```
