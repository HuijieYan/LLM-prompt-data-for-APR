The bug is occurring in the `update` function of the `Text` class in the `matplotlib` library. The issue occurs when the `bbox` argument is placed before the `fontproperties` argument. This results in the `size` being ignored.

The potential error location within the function is in the lines:
```
bbox = kwargs.pop("bbox", sentinel)
super().update(kwargs)
if bbox is not sentinel:
    self.set_bbox(bbox)
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that when `bbox` is popped from `kwargs` before calling `super().update(kwargs)`, it results in the `size` attribute being ignored if it's placed before `fontproperties`.

To fix this bug, the order of operations needs to be adjusted. The `bbox` argument should be processed after `super().update(kwargs)` so that it does not interfere with the other font properties.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def update(self, kwargs):
    # docstring inherited
    # Update bbox last, as it depends on font properties.
    sentinel = object()  # bbox can be None, so use another sentinel.
    super().update(kwargs)
    bbox = kwargs.pop("bbox", sentinel)
    if bbox is not sentinel:
        self.set_bbox(bbox)
```
