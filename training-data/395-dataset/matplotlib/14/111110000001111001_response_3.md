The buggy function `update` is using the `pop` method on the `kwargs` dictionary to remove the 'bbox' key. However, if the 'bbox' key is not present in the `kwargs` dictionary, the `pop` method will raise a KeyError. This is the cause of the bug.

To fix this issue, we can modify the code to use the `get` method with a default value for the 'bbox' key, instead of using `pop`.

Here's the corrected code for the `update` method:

```python
def update(self, kwargs):
    # docstring inherited
    # Update bbox last, as it depends on font properties.
    bbox = kwargs.pop("bbox", None)  # Use get method with a default value of None
    super().update(kwargs)
    if bbox is not None:
        self.set_bbox(bbox)
```

By using the `get` method with a default value for the 'bbox' key, we can avoid the KeyError when the 'bbox' key is not present in the `kwargs` dictionary.
