The test function `test_fontproperties_kwarg_precedence` is testing the font size of the text labels created using `plt.xlabel` and `plt.ylabel`. The error message indicates that the font size for `text2` is expected to be 40.0, but the actual value is 12.0.

The potential error location is the function `update` in the `text.py` file. The `update` function is responsible for updating the text properties, including the font size. It seems that the font size is not being properly updated, leading to the discrepancy in the test case.

The bug is occurring because the `update` function is incorrectly updating the font properties. It should update the font size according to the given `kwargs`, but it seems that it's not doing so effectively.

To fix the bug, the `update` function needs to correctly handle the font size and ensure that it is properly updated based on the provided `kwargs`.

Here's the corrected `update` function:

```python
def update(self, kwargs):
    # docstring inherited
    # Update font properties and bbox properties
    fontproperties = kwargs.pop("fontproperties", None)
    if fontproperties:
        self.set_fontproperties(fontproperties)
    super().update(kwargs)
```

In this corrected function, we are first checking for the presence of `fontproperties` in `kwargs`. If it's present, we are using the `set_fontproperties` method to update the font properties. Then, we proceed with the superclass update for other properties. This should ensure that the font size is updated correctly according to the provided `kwargs`.
