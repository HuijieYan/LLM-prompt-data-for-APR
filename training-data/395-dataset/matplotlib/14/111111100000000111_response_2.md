The issue described in the GitHub report is related to the "size" argument being ignored if it is placed before "fontproperties" in functions related to displaying characters on the figure. The bug occurs in the `Text` class where the `update` method is not properly handling the "size" and "fontproperties" arguments. The "size" argument is being ignored if it is placed before "fontproperties".

To fix this bug, the `update` method needs to be modified to properly handle the "size" and "fontproperties" arguments.

Here's the corrected code for the `update` method:

```python
def update(self, kwargs):
    # docstring inherited
    # Update bbox last, as it depends on font properties.
    sentinel = object()  # bbox can be None, so use another sentinel.
    bbox = kwargs.pop("bbox", sentinel)
    fontproperties = kwargs.pop("fontproperties", None)
    size = kwargs.pop("size", None)
    if fontproperties:
        kwargs["fontproperties"] = fontproperties
    if size:
        kwargs["size"] = size
    super().update(kwargs)
    if bbox is not sentinel:
        self.set_bbox(bbox)
```

With this modification, the `update` method will handle the "size" and "fontproperties" arguments properly, ensuring that "size" is not ignored when placed before "fontproperties".
