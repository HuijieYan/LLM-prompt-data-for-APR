The buggy function is the `update` method in the `Text` class. The function is designed to update the `bbox` attribute of the `Text` object. However, the function has a bug where it tries to access the `bbox` attribute from the `kwargs` dictionary without first checking if it exists. This can result in a KeyError if `bbox` is not present in the `kwargs` dictionary.

To fix the bug, the function should first check if the `bbox` key exists in the `kwargs` dictionary before trying to access its value. If the key does not exist, the function should handle this case appropriately, for example, by setting a default value for the `bbox` attribute.

Here's the corrected code for the `update` method:

```python
def update(self, kwargs):
    bbox = kwargs.get("bbox")  # Check if key exists in kwargs
    if bbox is not None:  # If key exists, update the bbox attribute
        self.set_bbox(bbox)

    # Rest of the function code
    # ...
```
In this corrected code:
1. We use the `get` method to safely retrieve the `bbox` value from the `kwargs` dictionary without raising a KeyError.
2. We then check if the `bbox` value is not None before updating the `bbox` attribute of the `Text` object.

This approach ensures that the function handles the case where the `bbox` key may not be present in the `kwargs` dictionary, preventing potential KeyError issues.
