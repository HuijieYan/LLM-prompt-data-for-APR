The issue with the provided function is that the update method is using pop() to remove the "bbox" key from the kwargs dictionary, but the pop() method is removing the key-value pair from the dictionary, which causes the "bbox" key to be removed from the kwargs. Subsequently, the following call to super().update(kwargs) is not including the "bbox" key in the update, leading to an incorrect behavior.

To fix this issue, we can modify the update method to use get() instead of pop() to retrieve the value for "bbox" without removing it from the dictionary. This ensures that the "bbox" key remains in the kwargs dictionary for the subsequent call to super().update(kwargs).

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def update(self, kwargs):
    bbox = kwargs.get("bbox")  # Retrieve value for "bbox" without removing the key from kwargs
    super().update(kwargs)  # Update the properties using the kwargs
    if bbox is not None:
        self.set_bbox(bbox)  # Set the bbox if it exists
```
