Potential error location: 
The `update` function is trying to pop the "bbox" key from the `kwargs` dictionary and then call the `set_bbox` function. However, if "bbox" is not present in the `kwargs` dictionary, it will result in a KeyError.

Reasons behind the bug:
The bug occurs because the code does not check whether the "bbox" key exists in the `kwargs` dictionary before trying to pop it.

Possible approach for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we can check if the "bbox" key exists in the `kwargs` dictionary before trying to pop it. If it exists, then we can call the `set_bbox` function with the extracted value.

Corrected code:

```python
def update(self, kwargs):
    # docstring inherited
    # Update bbox last, as it depends on font properties.
    sentinel = object()  # bbox can be None, so use another sentinel.
    bbox = kwargs.pop("bbox", None)  # Check if "bbox" exists in kwargs
    super().update(kwargs)
    if bbox is not None:  # Check if bbox is not None before calling set_bbox
        self.set_bbox(bbox)
```
