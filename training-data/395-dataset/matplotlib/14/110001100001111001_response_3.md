The problem with the given function is that it doesn't handle the "bbox" argument properly. The "bbox" argument is popped from the kwargs dictionary and then used to call the "set_bbox" method. However, there is no check to ensure that "bbox" is not None before calling "self.set_bbox(bbox)".

To fix this, we need to add a check to see if "bbox" is not None before calling "self.set_bbox(bbox)".

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def update(self, kwargs):
    # docstring inherited
    # Update bbox last, as it depends on font properties.
    sentinel = object()  # bbox can be None, so use another sentinel.
    bbox = kwargs.pop("bbox", sentinel)
    super().update(kwargs)
    if bbox is not sentinel and bbox is not None:
        self.set_bbox(bbox)
```
