The test case `test_fontproperties_kwarg_precedence` is trying to set the font properties using the `fontproperties` argument and the `size` argument simultaneously, and then checking if the size is correctly set.

The potential error location is within the `update` method of the `Text` class. The bug occurs because the `update` method calls `self.set_bbox(bbox)` after `super().update(kwargs)`. This means that `bbox` is set after the other font properties have been updated, leading to inconsistent font size.

The bug occurs because `self.set_bbox(bbox)` should be called before `super().update(kwargs)` to ensure that the bbox is set based on the correct font properties.

To fix the bug, the updated code for the `update` method in the `Text` class is as follows:

```python
def update(self, kwargs):
    # docstring inherited
    # Update bbox last, as it depends on font properties.
    sentinel = object()  # bbox can be None, so use another sentinel.
    bbox = kwargs.pop("bbox", sentinel)
    if bbox is not sentinel:
        self.set_bbox(bbox)
    super().update(kwargs)
```

With this change, the `set_bbox` function is called before updating the font properties as it depends on the font properties, ensuring that the font size is consistent.

This should resolve the bug and make the test case `test_fontproperties_kwarg_precedence` pass without any assertion errors.
