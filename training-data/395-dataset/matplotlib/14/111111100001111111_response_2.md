The bug occurs in the `update` function of the `Text` class. The `kwargs` dictionary is used to update the properties of the text, including the `fontproperties` and `size`. However, the `set_bbox` method is called after updating the `kwargs`, which may cause the `size` property to be ignored if it is placed before `fontproperties` in the `kwargs` dictionary.

To fix this bug, the `set_bbox` method should be called before updating the `kwargs` to ensure that the `size` property is not ignored.

Here's the corrected `update` function:

```python
def update(self, kwargs):
    sentinel = object()  # bbox can be None, so use another sentinel.
    bbox = kwargs.pop("bbox", sentinel)
    if bbox is not sentinel:
        self.set_bbox(bbox)
    super().update(kwargs)
```
