The buggy function `update` is not correctly handling the `kwargs` and `bbox` arguments. When the `kwargs` dictionary is being updated with `bbox`, the function is not handling it properly.

The function is intended to pop the "bbox" key from the `kwargs` dictionary and then update the `bbox` if it's different from a sentinel value. However, the update method is called on the superclass before checking the `bbox` value. This means that there's a possibility that the `bbox` is updated before it's checked, and that might affect the subsequent operations.

To fix this issue, the function should first check the `bbox` value, and then call the update method if necessary.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def update(self, kwargs):
    # docstring inherited
    # Update bbox last, as it depends on font properties.
    sentinel = object()  # bbox can be None, so use another sentinel.
    bbox = kwargs.pop("bbox", sentinel)
    if bbox is not sentinel:
        self.set_bbox(bbox)
    super().update(kwargs)
```
