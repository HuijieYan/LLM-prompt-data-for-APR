The error is caused by the incorrect handling of the "size" and "fontproperties" arguments in the `update` function of the Text class in Matplotlib. The error message indicates that the "size" argument is being ignored if it is placed before the "fontproperties" argument.

To fix the bug, we should modify the update function to correctly handle the "size" and "fontproperties" arguments.

Here's the corrected code for the update function:

```python
# corrected function
def update(self, kwargs):
    # docstring inherited
    # Update bbox last, as it depends on font properties.
    sentinel = object()  # bbox can be None, so use another sentinel.
    bbox = kwargs.pop("bbox", sentinel)
    
    fontproperties = kwargs.get("fontproperties", None)
    size = kwargs.get("size", None)
    
    if fontproperties is not None:
        if size is not None:
            fontproperties.set_size(size)

    super().update(kwargs)
    if bbox is not sentinel:
        self.set_bbox(bbox)
```

With these changes, the "size" attribute will be correctly handled even if it is placed before the "fontproperties" attribute, resolving the issue described in the bug report.
