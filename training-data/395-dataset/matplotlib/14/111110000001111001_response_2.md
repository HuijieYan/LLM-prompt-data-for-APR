The bug in the `update` function is that the `bbox` parameter is being popped from the `kwargs` dictionary before calling the `super().update` method. This means that if the `bbox` value is needed during the update, it won't be available.

To fix this bug, the `bbox` parameter should be popped after calling the `super().update` method so that it is available when needed.

Here's the corrected `update` function:

```python
def update(self, kwargs):
    # docstring inherited
    # Update bbox last, as it depends on font properties.
    super().update(kwargs)
    bbox = kwargs.pop("bbox", None)
    if bbox is not None:
        self.set_bbox(bbox)
```
