The potential error in the provided code is that the `update` function is not properly updating the `bbox` property. The `kwargs` parameter is used to update the properties of the object, but the `bbox` property is not being updated correctly.

The bug occurs because the `bbox` property is being popped from `kwargs` and then checked if it is `sentinel`. If it is not `sentinel`, the `set_bbox` method is called to update the `bbox`. However, the `bbox` property is not being updated by just popping it from `kwargs`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `bbox` property properly before calling the `set_bbox` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `update` function:

```python
def update(self, kwargs):
    # docstring inherited
    # Update bbox last, as it depends on font properties.
    bbox = kwargs.pop("bbox", None)  # Check if "bbox" exists in kwargs, otherwise default to None
    super().update(kwargs)
    if bbox is not None:
        self.set_bbox(bbox)
```

In the corrected code, we update the `bbox` property by popping it from `kwargs`. If it exists, we then call the `set_bbox` method to update the `bbox` property. This ensures that the `bbox` property is properly updated when calling the `update` function.
