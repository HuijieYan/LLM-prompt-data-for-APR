The issue is occurring because the `size` argument is being overridden by the `fontproperties` argument when it is placed before it. The `size` argument needs to take precedence over the `fontproperties` defaults.

To fix this issue, the `size` argument should be given higher priority than the `fontproperties` argument. This can be achieved by modifying the `update` function of the `Text` class to correctly handle the `size` argument when it is present in the `kwargs`.

Here's the corrected code for the `update` function:

```python
def update(self, kwargs):
    # docstring inherited
    # Update bbox last, as it depends on font properties.
    sentinel = object()  # bbox can be None, so use another sentinel.
    bbox = kwargs.pop("bbox", sentinel)
    font_size = kwargs.pop("size", None)

    if font_size is not None:  # Handle the font size argument
        self.set_fontsize(font_size)

    super().update(kwargs)
    if bbox is not sentinel:
        self.set_bbox(bbox)
```

With this update, the `font_size` will be checked explicitly from the `kwargs`, allowing it to take precedence over the font properties.

After making this change, the associated test should pass, and the bug report's issue should be resolved.
