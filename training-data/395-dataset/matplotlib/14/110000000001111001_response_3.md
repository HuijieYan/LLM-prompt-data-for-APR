The issue with the provided function is that the 'self' parameter is not a part of the class method, which could cause the function to fail. Additionally, the use of 'pop' could lead to unpredictable behavior as it modifies the input dictionary. 

To fix the bug:
1. Remove the 'self' parameter from the function as it is not necessary.
2. Avoid modifying the input dictionary 'kwargs' by using a copy of it for further processing.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def update(kwargs):
    # docstring inherited
    # Update bbox last, as it depends on font properties.
    sentinel = object()  # bbox can be None, so use another sentinel.
    bbox = kwargs.get("bbox", sentinel)
    if bbox is not sentinel:
        # Assuming self.set_bbox is a method in the same class, use it directly
        set_bbox(bbox)
    # Assuming super() is meant to call a method from the parent class, use MyClass.super_method() instead
    super().update(kwargs.copy())
```
