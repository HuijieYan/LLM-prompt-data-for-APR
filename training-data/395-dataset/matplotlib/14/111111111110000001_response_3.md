Potential error location within the problematic function:
The issue seems to be related to how the `fontproperties` and `size` kwargs are handled within the `update` function of the `Text` class.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug occurs because the `update` function is not correctly handling the `fontproperties` and `size` kwargs, leading to incorrect font size being set for the text.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the `update` function properly handles the `fontproperties` and `size` kwargs to correctly set the font size.
2. Check if the `fontproperties` and `size` kwargs are being overridden by default values within the `update` function.
3. Verify that the `set_bbox` function is correctly called after `update` to ensure that the correct font properties are used to set the bounding box.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def update(self, kwargs):
    # docstring inherited
    # Update bbox last, as it depends on font properties.
    bbox = kwargs.pop("bbox", None)
    fontproperties = kwargs.pop("fontproperties", None)
    size = kwargs.pop("size", None)
    if fontproperties is not None:
        kwargs['fontproperties'] = fontproperties
    if size is not None:
        kwargs['size'] = size
    super().update(kwargs)
    if bbox is not None:
        self.set_bbox(bbox)
```

In the corrected code, I have added handling for the `fontproperties` and `size` kwargs within the `update` function to ensure that they are not incorrectly overridden by default values. Additionally, I removed the use of the `sentinel` object and directly handled the `bbox` value. This should resolve the issue with the incorrect font size being set for the text.
