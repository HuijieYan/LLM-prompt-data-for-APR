The bug is occurring in the `update` function where the `bbox` is being ignored if it is placed before the `fontproperties`. This is happening because the `update` function is popping the `bbox` from the `kwargs` dictionary before calling `super().update(kwargs)`. 

To fix this bug, we need to move the `bbox` popping after calling `super().update(kwargs)`. This way, the `bbox` will be processed after all the other properties have been updated.

Here's the corrected `update` function:

```python
def update(self, kwargs):
    sentinel = object()  # bbox can be None, so use another sentinel.
    bbox = kwargs.pop("bbox", sentinel)
    super().update(kwargs)
    if bbox is not sentinel:
        self.set_bbox(bbox)
```

With this correction, the `bbox` will now be updated correctly even when it is placed before the `fontproperties`.

This fix should resolve the issue where the `size` is ignored when placed before `fontproperties`.
