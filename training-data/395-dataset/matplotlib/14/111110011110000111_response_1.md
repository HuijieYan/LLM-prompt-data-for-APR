The error occurs in the test function `test_fontproperties_kwarg_precedence`, specifically at the line `assert text2.get_size() == 40.0`. The error message indicates that the `get_size` method is returning a value of 12.0 instead of the expected 40.0.

The potential error location within the `update` function of the `Text` class, where the `update` method is used to update the text properties. It seems that the `fontproperties` are not being correctly applied when the `size` argument is placed before `fontproperties`.

The bug occurs because the `update` method incorrectly handles the `bbox` property, which causes the `fontproperties` not to be applied correctly when `size` is placed before `fontproperties`.

To fix this bug, the `update` method should be modified to correctly handle the `fontproperties` and `size` arguments. Specifically, the `bbox` handling logic should not interfere with the application of `fontproperties` and `size`. Additionally, the order in which `fontproperties` and `size` are applied should not matter.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def update(self, kwargs):
    # docstring inherited
    # Update bbox last, as it depends on font properties.
    sentinel = object()  # bbox can be None, so use another sentinel.
    if "bbox" in kwargs:
        bbox = kwargs["bbox"]
    else:
        bbox = sentinel
    super().update(kwargs)
    if bbox is not sentinel:
        self.set_bbox(bbox)
```

This revised code ensures that the `fontproperties` and `size` are correctly applied and are not overridden by the handling of the `bbox` property.
