    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def update(self, kwargs):
        # docstring inherited
        # Update bbox last, as it depends on font properties.
        sentinel = object()  # bbox can be None, so use another sentinel.
        bbox = kwargs.get("bbox", sentinel)  # change pop() to get()
        super().update(kwargs)
        if bbox is not sentinel:
            self.set_bbox(bbox)
```

The `pop()` method has been changed to the `get()` method to prevent the removal of the "bbox" key from the `kwargs` dictionary. This change will ensure that the "bbox" key retains its value for use in the `if` statement.
