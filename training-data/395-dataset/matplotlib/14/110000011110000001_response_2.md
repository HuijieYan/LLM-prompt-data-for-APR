The issue here is that the `update` function is not correctly updating the font properties and is causing the `get_size()` method to return an unexpected size.

The potential error location is within the `update` function where the `kwargs` are handled incorrectly. It looks like the `update` function is designed to update the font properties, but it's not doing so effectively.

The `update` function should correctly handle the font properties passed as kwargs and set them accordingly. The current implementation does not handle font properties properly, which leads to the unexpected behavior in the test case.

One approach to fixing the bug is to ensure that the font properties in the `kwargs` are correctly handled and set. This may involve checking for font properties specifically and applying them to the text elements.

Here's the corrected code for the `update` function:

```python
def update(self, kwargs):
    # docstring inherited
    # Update bbox last, as it depends on font properties.
    sentinel = object()  # bbox can be None, so use another sentinel.
    bbox = kwargs.pop("bbox", sentinel)
    
    fontproperties = kwargs.pop("fontproperties", None)
    size = kwargs.pop("size", None)
    
    if fontproperties:
        kwargs['fontproperties'] = fontproperties
    if size:
        kwargs['size'] = size
    
    super().update(kwargs)
    
    if bbox is not sentinel:
        self.set_bbox(bbox)
```

This code ensures that the font properties and size are correctly handled and set when updating the text elements. It addresses the issues related to font properties not being updated correctly and causing unexpected behavior in the test case.
