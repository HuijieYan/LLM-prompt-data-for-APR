Potential error location:
The issue seems to be with the `update` method in the provided code. It appears that the method is not correctly updating the font properties, leading to a discrepancy between the expected and actual font sizes in the test case.

Reasons behind the occurrence of the bug:
The bug seems to be occurring because the `update` method is incorrectly handling the font properties passed as keyword arguments. It is not properly updating the font properties based on the provided kwargs.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the font properties passed as keyword arguments are correctly updated within the `update` method.
2. Check for any conflicts or overriding of font properties to ensure that the correct font properties are being applied.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def update(self, kwargs):
    # docstring inherited
    # Update bbox last, as it depends on font properties.
    sentinel = object()  # bbox can be None, so use another sentinel.
    bbox = kwargs.pop("bbox", sentinel)
    fontproperties = kwargs.pop("fontproperties", None)
    if fontproperties:
        self.set_font(fontproperties)
    super().update(kwargs)
    if bbox is not sentinel:
        self.set_bbox(bbox)
```
In the corrected code, we have added a check for the "fontproperties" keyword argument and applied the font properties using `self.set_font()` method. This ensures that the font properties are properly updated when the `update` method is called.
