The issue with the `update` method is that it updates the `kwargs` dictionary first and then checks for the existence of the "bbox" key. If the "bbox" key is present, it calls the `set_bbox` method, which depends on font properties. However, font properties are set after the update of `kwargs`. This results in font properties not being properly applied to the text.

To fix this, the order of operations inside the `update` method needs to be changed so that font properties are set before the update of `kwargs` and subsequent checks for the "bbox" key.

Here's the corrected `update` method:

```python
def update(self, kwargs):
    # Update font properties first
    font_properties = kwargs.pop("fontproperties", None)
    if font_properties:
        self.set_fontproperties(font_properties)

    # Update the remaining properties
    super().update(kwargs)

    # Check and apply the bbox
    bbox = kwargs.pop("bbox", None)
    if bbox:
        self.set_bbox(bbox)
```

In the corrected `update` method, font properties are updated first using the "fontproperties" key from the `kwargs` dictionary. Then the remaining properties are updated using the `super().update(kwargs)` call. Finally, the "bbox" key is checked and if present, the `set_bbox` method is called. This ensures that font properties are properly applied to the text.
