The provided test case "test_fontproperties_kwarg_precedence" is trying to verify that the "size" argument takes precedence over the "fontproperties" default settings while creating labels for a plot. The bug appears to be in the "update" function related to font properties handling.

The error message states that the assertion "assert text2.get_size() == 40.0" failed because the actual size returned by "text2.get_size()" was 12.0, not 40.0 as expected. This indicates that the "size" argument is not taking precedence over the "fontproperties" default settings.

The potential error location within the "update" function is the handling of the "bbox" and "kwargs". The size might not be getting updated correctly due to how the font properties are being set in relation to the "kwargs".

The bug occurs because the "update" function is not handling the font properties and size correctly when they are passed as kwargs. The "size" is not taking precedence over the "fontproperties" default settings, resulting in an incorrect size for the text.

To fix the bug, the "update" function needs to be modified to properly handle the font properties and size when they are passed as kwargs. This can be achieved by ensuring that the "size" argument takes precedence over the "fontproperties" default settings, as intended by the test case.

Here's the corrected code for the "update" function:

```python
def update(self, kwargs):
    # docstring inherited
    # Update bbox last, as it depends on font properties.
    sentinel = object()  # bbox can be None, so use another sentinel.
    bbox = kwargs.pop("bbox", sentinel)
    if "fontproperties" in kwargs:
        font_properties = kwargs.pop("fontproperties")
        kwargs["fontproperties"] = font_properties
    if "size" in kwargs:
        font_size = kwargs.pop("size")
        kwargs["size"] = font_size
    super().update(kwargs)
    if bbox is not sentinel:
        self.set_bbox(bbox)
```

With this correction, the "update" function will handle the "fontproperties" and "size" arguments correctly when passed as kwargs, ensuring that the "size" takes precedence over the "fontproperties" default settings as intended.
