Potential Error Location:
The issue with the original function is that it is not handling the "bbox" argument properly. The update function is trying to pop the "bbox" argument from the kwargs dictionary, but if the "bbox" argument is not in the kwargs dictionary, it will raise a KeyError. Additionally, after popping the "bbox" argument, the function tries to call self.set_bbox(bbox), assuming that "bbox" is a valid argument.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function is not handling the "bbox" argument properly. It should check if "bbox" is in the kwargs dictionary before trying to pop it, and it should also handle the case where "bbox" is not provided.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check if "bbox" is in the kwargs dictionary before popping it, and if it's not, provide a default value for it.
2. After popping the "bbox" argument, check if it's a valid value before calling self.set_bbox(bbox).

Corrected Code:
```python
def update(self, kwargs):
    # docstring inherited
    # Update bbox last, as it depends on font properties.
    sentinel = object()  # bbox can be None, so use another sentinel.
    bbox = kwargs.pop("bbox", None)
    super().update(kwargs)
    if bbox is not None:
        self.set_bbox(bbox)
```
