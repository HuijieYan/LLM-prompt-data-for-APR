The potential error location in the problematic function is the `update` method, specifically the line `super().update(kwargs)`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `update` method is updating the font properties before the size property, which causes the size property to be ignored.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `size` property is updated before the `fontproperties` are updated in the `update` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `update` method:

```python
def update(self, kwargs):
    # docstring inherited
    # Update bbox last, as it depends on font properties.
    sentinel = object()  # bbox can be None, so use another sentinel.
    bbox = kwargs.pop("bbox", sentinel)
    
    # Check if size is in kwargs and update it first
    if 'size' in kwargs:
        self.set_fontsize(kwargs['size'])
    
    super().update(kwargs)
    
    if bbox is not sentinel:
        self.set_bbox(bbox)
```

With this correction, the `size` property will be updated before the `fontproperties`, ensuring that it is not ignored.
