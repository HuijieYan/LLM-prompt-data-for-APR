The test function creates a text object and then calls the `get_window_extent` function with a custom dpi value. The test then compares the result with the default dpi and asserts that the figure dpi has not been permanently changed.

The potential error in the `get_window_extent` function is with handling the `dpi` argument. It sets the `self.figure.dpi` to the custom `dpi` value if it is provided, but it doesn't revert it back to the original `dpi` if it was changed.

The error message from the test function indicates that the figure's dpi has not been reverted back to the original value after calling `get_window_extent` with a custom dpi.

To fix this bug, the `self.figure.dpi` should be reverted to its original value after using the custom `dpi` for calculation. This can be achieved by storing the original `dpi` before modifying it and then setting it back at the end of the function.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_window_extent` function:

```python
def get_window_extent(self, renderer=None, dpi=None):
    if not self.get_visible():
        return Bbox.unit()
    
    original_dpi = self.figure.dpi  # store the original dpi
    
    if dpi is not None:
        self.figure.dpi = dpi
    
    if self.get_text() == '':
        tx, ty = self._get_xy_display()
        return Bbox.from_bounds(tx, ty, 0, 0)
    
    if renderer is not None:
        self._renderer = renderer
    
    if self._renderer is None:
        self._renderer = self.figure._cachedRenderer
    
    if self._renderer is None:
        raise RuntimeError('Cannot get window extent w/o renderer')
    
    bbox, info, descent = self._get_layout(self._renderer)
    x, y = self.get_unitless_position()
    x, y = self.get_transform().transform((x, y))
    bbox = bbox.translated(x, y)
    
    if dpi is not None:
        self.figure.dpi = original_dpi  # revert the dpi back to the original value
    
    return bbox
```

With this correction, the `self.figure.dpi` will now be reverted back to its original value after using a custom dpi for the calculation, ensuring that the figure's dpi is not permanently changed.
