The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement `if dpi is not None:`. This statement is intended to handle cases where a custom dpi value is provided, but the implementation is incorrect.

The bug occurs because the variable `dpi_orig` is overwritten with the current figure dpi before it is used to reset the figure dpi at the end of the function. This can lead to incorrect dpi values being applied to the figure.

To fix the bug, we should store the original figure dpi before modifying it and then reset it to the original value at the end of the function.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_window_extent` function:

```python
def get_window_extent(self, renderer=None, dpi=None):
    """
    Return the `.Bbox` bounding the text, in display units.

    In addition to being used internally, this is useful for specifying
    clickable regions in a png file on a web page.

    Parameters
    ----------
    renderer : Renderer, optional
        A renderer is needed to compute the bounding box.  If the artist
        has already been drawn, the renderer is cached; thus, it is only
        necessary to pass this argument when calling `get_window_extent`
        before the first `draw`.  In practice, it is usually easier to
        trigger a draw first (e.g. by saving the figure).

    dpi : float, optional
        The dpi value for computing the bbox, defaults to
        ``self.figure.dpi`` (*not* the renderer dpi); should be set e.g. if
        to match regions with a figure saved with a custom dpi value.

    dpi_orig = self.figure.dpi  # Store the original dpi value
