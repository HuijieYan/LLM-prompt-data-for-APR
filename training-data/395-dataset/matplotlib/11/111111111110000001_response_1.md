The error message is indicating that the DPI value of the figure (`fig.dpi`) has been permanently changed despite the last assertion checking for the equality of the DPI values.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the part where the DPI value is temporarily modified for the duration of the function's execution, but is not reverted back to its original state after the calculations. This can be seen in the lines where `dpi` and `dpi_orig` values are modified and reset, but only `dpi_orig` is being reset without restoring the original value of `figure.dpi`.

The bug is caused by the fact that the original DPI value of the figure is not properly restored after the temporary change, leading to the discrepancy between the expected and actual DPI value in the test case.

The bug can be fixed by ensuring that the original DPI value (`dpi_orig`) is restored at the end of the function, regardless of whether the DPI argument is provided or not.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def get_window_extent(self, renderer=None, dpi=None):
    """
    Return the `.Bbox` bounding the text, in display units.

    In addition to being used internally, this is useful for specifying
    clickable regions in a png file on a web page.

    Parameters
    ----------
    renderer : Renderer, optional
        A renderer is needed to compute the bounding box.  If the artist
        has already been drawn, the renderer is cached; thus, it is only
        necessary to pass this argument when calling `get_window_extent`
        before the first `draw`.  In practice, it is usually easier to
        trigger a draw first (e.g. by saving the figure).

    dpi : float, optional
        The dpi value for computing the bbox, defaults to
        ``self.figure.dpi`` (*not* the renderer dpi); should be set e.g. if
        to match regions with a figure saved with a custom dpi value.
