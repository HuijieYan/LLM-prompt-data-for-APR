The test case is comparing the window bounding box of a text object at the default dpi with the window bounding box of the same text object at 10 times the default dpi. The assertion checks if the high dpi bounding box is 10 times larger than the default dpi bounding box.

The bug is located in the `get_window_extent()` function of the `Text` class. The bug seems to be that when the DPI (dots per inch) is provided as an argument to the function, the original DPI of the figure is not restored after the calculation of the bounding box, resulting in the wrong comparison in the test case.

The reason for the bug is that the original DPI is not restored after the bounding box calculation. So, when the assertion checks `fig.dpi == dpi`, it fails because the figure's DPI is not reverted to its original value.

To fix the bug, the DPI should be restored to its original value after the calculation of the bounding box is performed.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_window_extent` function:

```python
def get_window_extent(self, renderer=None, dpi=None):
    """
    Return the `.Bbox` bounding the text, in display units.

    In addition to being used internally, this is useful for specifying
    clickable regions in a png file on a web page.

    Parameters
    ----------
    renderer : Renderer, optional
        A renderer is needed to compute the bounding box.  If the artist
        has already been drawn, the renderer is cached; thus, it is only
        necessary to pass this argument when calling `get_window_extent`
        before the first `draw`.  In practice, it is usually easier to
        trigger a draw first (e.g. by saving the figure).

    dpi : float, optional
        The dpi value for computing the bbox, defaults to
        ``self.figure.dpi`` (*not* the renderer dpi); should be set e.g. if
        to match regions with a figure saved with a custom dpi value.
    """
    # return _unit_box
    if not self.get_visible():
        return Bbox.unit()
    if dpi is not None:
        dpi_orig = self.figure.dpi  # Store the original DPI
        self.figure.dpi = dpi
    if self.get_text() == '':
        tx, ty = self._get_xy_display()
        if dpi is not None:
            self.figure.dpi = dpi_orig  # Restore the original DPI
        return Bbox.from_bounds(tx, ty, 0, 0)

    if renderer is not None:
        self._renderer = renderer
    if self._renderer is None:
        self._renderer = self.figure._cachedRenderer
    if self._renderer is None:
        raise RuntimeError('Cannot get window extent w/o renderer')

    bbox, info, descent = self._get_layout(self._renderer)
    x, y = self.get_unitless_position()
    x, y = self.get_transform().transform((x, y))
    bbox = bbox.translated(x, y)
    if dpi is not None:
        self.figure.dpi = dpi_orig  # Restore the original DPI
    return bbox
```

In the corrected code, the original DPI is stored in `dpi_orig` and restored back to the figure at the appropriate place within the function.
