Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to be related to the `get_window_extent` method of the `Text` object. When `get_window_extent` is called with a specific dpi value, it is not reverting back to the original dpi value after calculating the bounding box. As a result, the assertion `assert fig.dpi == dpi` fails because the dpi has been permanently changed.

Reasons behind the Occurrence of the Bug:
The bug occurs because the function does not handle the case where the dpi is passed as an argument to the `get_window_extent` method. It temporarily updates the `self.figure.dpi` value but fails to revert it back to the original value if `dpi` is not None.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the function should save the original dpi value, update it if `dpi` is not None, calculate the bounding box, and then revert the dpi value back to its original state. This will ensure that the dpi is not permanently changed after calling `get_window_extent`.

Corrected Code:
```python
def get_window_extent(self, renderer=None, dpi=None):
    """
    Return the `.Bbox` bounding the text, in display units.

    In addition to being used internally, this is useful for specifying
    clickable regions in a png file on a web page.

    Parameters
    ----------
    renderer : Renderer, optional
        A renderer is needed to compute the bounding box.  If the artist
        has already been drawn, the renderer is cached; thus, it is only
        necessary to pass this argument when calling `get_window_extent`
        before the first `draw`.  In practice, it is usually easier to
        trigger a draw first (e.g. by saving the figure).

    dpi : float, optional
        The dpi value for computing the bbox, defaults to
        ``self.figure.dpi`` (*not* the renderer dpi); should be set e.g. if
        to match regions with a figure saved with a custom dpi value.
