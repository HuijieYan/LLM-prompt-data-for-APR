The error message suggests that the `assert` statement `assert fig.dpi == dpi` failed. This means that the `fig.dpi` value has been permanently changed, which is not expected behavior according to the comment in the test function. The test is failing because the dpi value is being permanently changed within the `get_window_extent` method.

The potential error location in the `get_window_extent` method is where the DPI (dots per inch) value is being manipulated. The `self.figure.dpi` value is modified without being reset to its original value if `dpi` is provided as an argument.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the method is not handling the modified `dpi` value correctly. It temporarily changes the DPI for the purposes of computing the bounding box, but it does not revert to the original value before returning the result.

To fix the bug, the `self.figure.dpi` value should be temporarily modified for the computation of the bounding box and then reset to its original value before returning the result.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_window_extent` method:

```python
def get_window_extent(self, renderer=None, dpi=None):
    """
    Return the `.Bbox` bounding the text, in display units.

    In addition to being used internally, this is useful for specifying
    clickable regions in a png file on a web page.

    Parameters
    ----------
    renderer : Renderer, optional
        A renderer is needed to compute the bounding box. If the artist
        has already been drawn, the renderer is cached; thus, it is only
        necessary to pass this argument when calling `get_window_extent`
        before the first `draw`. In practice, it is usually easier to
        trigger a draw first (e.g. by saving the figure).

    dpi : float, optional
        The dpi value for computing the bbox, defaults to
        ``self.figure.dpi`` (*not* the renderer dpi); should be set e.g. if
        to match regions with a figure saved with a custom dpi value.
