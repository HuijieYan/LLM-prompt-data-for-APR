The test case is testing the behavior of the `get_window_extent` method on the `Text` class when called with different DPI values. It creates a text element on a plot, draws the figure, and then compares the window extent of the text at the original DPI with the window extent at a different DPI.

The error message indicates that the assertion `assert fig.dpi == dpi` is failing, with `fig.dpi` being 800.0 and `dpi` being 80.0.

The potential error location within the `get_window_extent` method is the handling of the `dpi` parameter. When `dpi` is not `None`, the original DPI of the figure is not reset properly, leading to incorrect window extent computations and failures in the test case.

The bug occurs because the code attempts to manipulate the DPI value without properly reverting it to its original state. This can cause the DPI to change unexpectedly and result in incorrect bounding box computations.

To fix the bug, the code should first save the original DPI value of the figure, then perform the necessary computations using the given DPI, and finally, revert the figure's DPI to its original value.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_window_extent` method:

```python
def get_window_extent(self, renderer=None, dpi=None):
    """
    Return the `.Bbox` bounding the text, in display units.
    
    In addition to being used internally, this is useful for specifying
    clickable regions in a png file on a web page.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    renderer : Renderer, optional
        A renderer is needed to compute the bounding box.  If the artist
        has already been drawn, the renderer is cached; thus, it is only
        necessary to pass this argument when calling `get_window_extent`
        before the first `draw`.  In practice, it is usually easier to
        trigger a draw first (e.g. by saving the figure).
    
    dpi : float, optional
        The dpi value for computing the bbox, defaults to
        ``self.figure.dpi`` (*not* the renderer dpi); should be set e.g. if
        to match regions with a figure saved with a custom dpi value.
    """
    if not self.get_visible():
        return Bbox.unit()
    if dpi is not None:
        dpi_orig = self.figure.dpi
        self.figure.dpi = dpi

    # Perform the necessary computations using the given DPI
    if self.get_text() == '':
        tx, ty = self._get_xy_display()
        bbox = Bbox.from_bounds(tx, ty, 0, 0)
    else:
        if renderer is not None:
            self._renderer = renderer
        if self._renderer is None:
            self._renderer = self.figure._cachedRenderer
        if self._renderer is None:
            raise RuntimeError('Cannot get window extent w/o renderer')
    
        bbox, info, descent = self._get_layout(self._renderer)
        x, y = self.get_unitless_position()
        x, y = self.get_transform().transform((x, y))
        bbox = bbox.translated(x, y)

    # Revert the figure's DPI to its original value if the given DPI is not None
    if dpi is not None:
        self.figure.dpi = dpi_orig

    return bbox
```

In the corrected code, the original DPI of the figure is saved as `dpi_orig` before its modification and is properly reverted at the end of the method. This ensures that the DPI of the figure remains unchanged after calling `get_window_extent` with a specific DPI value.
