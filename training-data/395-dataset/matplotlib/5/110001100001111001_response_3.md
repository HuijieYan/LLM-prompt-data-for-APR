The provided code initializes a scatter plot with various markers on a given set of x and y coordinates. The bug inside the function appears to be with the handling of the `linewidths` variable. In the fourth test case, the linewidths parameter is provided as a list. However, the function appears to be expecting a scalar or array-like input for linewidths, rather than a list.

The reason for the bug is that the function does not handle the case where the `linewidths` parameter is provided as a list. It expects this parameter to be a scalar or array-like, and therefore raises an error when it receives a list.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to handle a list of linewidths properly. We can check the type of the `linewidths` parameter and convert it to the appropriate format if it's a list.

Here's the corrected code for the `scatter` function:

```python
# corrected function
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    # ... (other code)

    if isinstance(linewidths, list):
        linewidths = np.array(linewidths)
    else:
        linewidths = linewidths

    # ... (other code)

    return collection
```
