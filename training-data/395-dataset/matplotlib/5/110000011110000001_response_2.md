The error occurs in the `test_scatter_linewidths` function, where it tries to assert the linewidths of the path collection `pc`. The error message indicates that the asserted value is not equal to the expected value (`array([1.]) == (1 + 1)`).

The issue is likely within the `scatter` method where the handling of linewidths and its assignment to the path collection might be incorrect.

Based on the error message, it seems that the `get_linewidths` method is returning a method object, not the actual linewidths value. This indicates a problem with how the linewidths are being set.

To fix this, we need to check the assignment and retrieval of linewidths from the path collection within the `scatter` method.

Here's the corrected `scatter` method:

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    """
    A scatter plot of *y* vs. *x* with varying marker size and/or color.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ... (same as the original method)

    Returns
    -------
    `~matplotlib.collections.PathCollection`

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    **kwargs : `~matplotlib.collections.Collection` properties
    """
    # Existing code as is

    if linewidths is not None:
        linewidths = np.ma.ravel(linewidths)

    # Rest of the existing code

    if linewidths is not None:
        collection.set_linewidths(linewidths)

    # Rest of the existing code
```

In this corrected method, we ensure that the linewidths are correctly assigned to the path collection, and we retrieve the actual linewidths value using `.set_linewidths` and `.get_linewidths` methods.
