The error occurs because the `assert` statement is comparing an array with a different value, causing the assertion to fail.

The bug is likely in the `scatter` method. It seems that the `linewidths` parameter is not being handled correctly, leading to incorrect values being set for the `PathCollection` linewidths.

To fix the bug, the `scatter` method should correctly handle the `linewidths` parameter, ensuring that it behaves as expected and sets the correct linewidths for the `PathCollection`.

Here's the corrected code for the `scatter` method:

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    """
    A scatter plot of *y* vs. *x* with varying marker size and/or color.

    ... # (omitted docstring)

    """
    # Process **kwargs to handle aliases, conflicts with explicit kwargs:
    
    # (other lines of code remain the same)

    if numpy.isscalar(linewidths) or linewidths is None:
        linewidths = [linewidths] * x.size

    if len(linewidths) not in (1, x.size):
        raise ValueError("linewidths must be a scalar, or the same size as x and y")

    # rest of the method remains the same
```

This fix ensures that the `linewidths` parameter is correctly processed and applied to the `PathCollection` in the `scatter` method.
