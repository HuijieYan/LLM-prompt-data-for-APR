The issue with the "scatter" function seems to be related to the "linewidths" parameter not working in newer version of Matplotlib. The code provided in the GitHub issue sets the "linewidths" parameter for scatter plots, but it doesn't seem to have any effect in Matplotlib version 3.1.0.

The potential error location within the "scatter" function is likely related to the handling of the "linewidths" parameter and its impact on the appearance of the markers.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug might be related to changes in the implementation of the "scatter" function in the newer version of Matplotlib, causing the "linewidths" parameter to no longer have the intended effect.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to revise the implementation of the "scatter" function to ensure that the "linewidths" parameter correctly affects the thickness of the marker edges.

Here's the corrected code for the "scatter" function:

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
            # Rest of the code remains unchanged

            # process linewidths to account for different scalar and array-like inputs
            linewidths = np.broadcast_to(linewidths, x.size)

            # ... existing code for scatter function ...

            # apply linewidths to scatter plot
            collection = mcoll.PathCollection(
                (path,), scales,
                facecolors=colors,
                edgecolors=edgecolors,
                linewidths=linewidths,
                offsets=offsets,
                transOffset=kwargs.pop('transform', self.transData),
                alpha=alpha
            )

            # ... existing code for scatter function ...
```

In the revised code, we handle the "linewidths" parameter specifically to ensure that it correctly applies the specified thickness to the marker edges in the scatter plot.
