Looking at the issue description and the associated test cases, it seems that the problem lies in the `scatter` function of the `Axes` class in Matplotlib. The issue is related to the `linewidths` parameter not working as expected in newer versions of Matplotlib.

Upon analyzing the function, it appears that the issue might be due to conflicting assignments related to the `linewidths` parameter, with a constant value being assigned after parsing the arguments.

A possible approach to fixing this bug would be to ensure that the `linewidths` parameter is correctly handled and its value is not overwritten unnecessarily by constant values. Additionally, the `edgecolors` parameter may need to be adjusted accordingly based on the requirements of the `linewidths`.

Here's the corrected code for the `scatter` function:

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
                    vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
                    verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
                    **kwargs):
    # Existing code

    # Process **kwargs to handle aliases, conflicts with explicit kwargs:

    self._process_unit_info(xdata=x, ydata=y, kwargs=kwargs)
    x = self.convert_xunits(x)
    y = self.convert_yunits(y)

    # Existing code

    # Replace the existing line with a conditional assignment, which preserves the value if it's not None
    linewidths = (linewidths if linewidths is not None else rcParams['lines.linewidth'])

    # Existing code

    if not marker_obj.is_filled():
        edgecolors = 'face' if edgecolors is None else edgecolors  # Adjust edgecolors based on the need for linewidths

    # Existing code
```

With these adjustments, the issue with the `linewidths` parameter in the `scatter` function should be resolved, and it should work as expected in newer versions of Matplotlib.
