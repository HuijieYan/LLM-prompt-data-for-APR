Potential error location:
The issue seems to be with the `linewidths` parameter not being applied correctly when calling the `scatter` function. The `linewidths` parameter should control the thickness of the marker's edge, but it seems to be not working as expected for different marker types.

Reason behind the bug:
The `scatter` method is not correctly processing the `linewidths` parameter, resulting in the specified line widths not being applied to the markers.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
The issue could be related to the way the scatter function is processing the `linewidths` parameter. It might be necessary to check the implementation of the `scatter` function to ensure that it correctly handles different line widths for markers.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    # Existing implementation
    
    # Process **kwargs to handle aliases, conflicts with explicit kwargs:
    
    # New implementation to handle linewidths parameter
    if linewidths is not None:
        # Convert linewidths to an array if it's a scalar
        if not cbook.iterable(linewidths):
            linewidths = [linewidths] * x.size
        linewidths = np.ma.ravel(linewidths)
        
    # Continue with the rest of the implementation
```

In the corrected code, we add a check for the `linewidths` parameter and ensure that it is correctly processed to handle different line widths for the markers. This change should address the issue with the `linewidths` parameter not working as expected in the scatter function.
