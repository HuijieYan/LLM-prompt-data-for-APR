The error is occurring because the `assert pc.get_linewidths() == i + 1` assertion is failing. This means that the `pc.get_linewidths()` method is not returning the expected linewidth.

The potential error location is within the `scatter` function, particularly in the part where the `linewidths` parameter is processed and applied to the markers.

The bug occurs because the handling of the `linewidths` parameter was changed in Matplotlib version 2.0.0. Prior to this version, the `linewidths` parameter accepted a single scalar value or an array-like of linewidths. However, in versions after 2.0.0, the handling of `linewidths` was changed to allow for different behavior.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `scatter` function to handle the `linewidths` parameter according to the new behavior introduced in version 2.0.0. Specifically, when `linewidths` is an array, it should be processed accordingly to match the behavior expected in the test function.

Here's the corrected code for the `scatter` function:

```python
# relative function's signature in this file
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):

    # ... previous code ...

    linewidths = np.asarray(linewidths)
    
    if np.iterable(linewidths):
        if len(linewidths) not in (1, x.size):
            raise ValueError("linewidths must be a scalar or a sequence "
                             "with the same length as x and y")
        linewidths = np.ma.ravel(linewidths)

    # ... remaining code ...

    return collection
```

By making this adjustment, the `scatter` function will properly handle the `linewidths` parameter, ensuring that it behaves as expected when a scalar or an array-like of linewidths is provided. This should address the problem observed in the test case, and the assertion `assert pc.get_linewidths() == i + 1` should no longer fail.
