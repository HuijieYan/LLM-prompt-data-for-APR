The test case `test_scatter_linewidths` is trying to verify the linewidths of a scatter plot. It creates a scatter plot with varying linewidths and then checks if the actual linewidths obtained from the plot match the expected values.

The error message indicates that the assertion `assert pc.get_linewidths() == i + 1` failed because the actual value obtained from `pc.get_linewidths()` does not match the expected value of `i + 1`.

The potential error location within the problematic function is most likely the implementation of the `scatter` method. The bug seems to be related to how the linewidths are handled for the scatter plot.

The error occurs because the `get_linewidths()` method does not return the expected linewidths.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `get_linewidths()` method returns the correct linewidths as per the input parameters and that it is defined correctly within the `scatter` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `scatter` method:

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    # ... (rest of the code remains the same)

    pc = mcoll.PathCollection(
        (path,), scales,
        facecolors=colors,
        edgecolors=edgecolors,
        linewidths=linewidths,  # Use the provided linewidths here
        offsets=offsets,
        transOffset=kwargs.pop('transform', self.transData),
        alpha=alpha
    )

    # ... (rest of the code remains the same)

    self.add_collection(pc)
    self._request_autoscale_view()

    return pc
```

In this corrected code, the `PathCollection` constructor is used to create the collection with the correct `linewidths` parameter obtained from the input, and the collection is added to the plot. This should fix the bug and ensure that the `get_linewidths()` method returns the expected linewidths values.
