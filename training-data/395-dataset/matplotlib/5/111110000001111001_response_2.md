The buggy code contains a scatter function that is responsible for creating a scatter plot. It seems that the scatter function is expecting edgecolors to be either a single value or a list of colors, but it is receiving 'face', which is causing the function to return edgecolor as 'face' and not dealing with the list of colors properly.

The buggy function is implemented in such a way that it is unable to handle multiple cases for the edgecolors variable. Additionally, the implementation checks for the special case of 'plotnonfinite' and colors being None, but it doesn't fully handle the edge case for multiple values of edgecolors and linewidths. 

To fix the issue, the implementation needs to handle the edgecolor input properly, especially when it is not a single color string but a sequence of colors. It should also be handled with proper type checks and conditional logic to set appropriate colors for each edge. Additionally, the implementation should consider if there is a case for a sequence of linewidths when multiple edgecolors are provided in the scatter function.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
class Axes(_AxesBase):
    # ... other methods ...

    def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None, vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None, verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False, **kwargs):
        # ... omitted code ...

        # Correcting the handling of edgecolors and linewidths
        if np.iterable(edgecolors) and len(edgecolors) == len(x):
            # edgecolors is a sequence of colors
            colors = edgecolors
        else:
            colors = edgecolors
        
        if np.iterable(linewidths) and len(linewidths) == len(x):
            # linewidths is a sequence
            if len(linewidths) == len(x):
                linewidths = np.asanyarray(linewidths)
        else:
            linewidths = float(linewidths)
        
        # ... omitted code ...
```

In the corrected code, the edgecolors and linewidths are properly handled to handle both single values and sequences. This should fix the issue with the original implementation.
