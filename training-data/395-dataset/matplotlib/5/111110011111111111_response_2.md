The error message indicates that the test case is failing because the `pc.get_linewidths()` method is returning a function rather than the expected value, leading to the assertion error. This suggests that the problem lies within the `scatter` method of the `Axes` class.

It appears that the bug is related to the incorrect handling of the `linewidths` parameter in the `scatter` method of the `Axes` class. The method is expected to set the linewidth of the marker, but it is returning a function instead.

This bug might have occurred due to changes in the implementation of the `scatter` method in newer versions of Matplotlib, which caused the `linewidths` parameter to be handled incorrectly.

To fix this bug, the `scatter` method of the `Axes` class should be modified to correctly handle the `linewidths` parameter. The method should ensure that the `linewidths` parameter is set as the width of the lines of the markers.

Here's the corrected `scatter` method:

```python
# Corrected scatter method
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    """
    A scatter plot of *y* vs. *x* with varying marker size and/or color.
    ... (rest of the docstring remains the same)

    Parameters
    ----------
    ... (existing parameters remain the same)

    linewidths : float or array-like, default: :rc:`lines.linewidth`
        The linewidth of the marker edges. Note: The default *edgecolors*
        is 'face'. You may want to change this as well.

    ... (rest of the parameters remain the same)

    Returns
    -------
    ... (existing return value remains the same)

    Other Parameters
    ----------------
    **kwargs : `~matplotlib.collections.Collection` properties
    """

    # Process **kwargs to handle aliases, conflicts with explicit kwargs:

    # Existing code remains the same

    if isinstance(linewidths, (list, np.ndarray)):
        linewidths = [i if i is not None else rcParams['lines.linewidth'] for i in linewidths]
    else:
        linewidths = linewidths if linewidths is not None else rcParams['lines.linewidth']

    # Rest of the existing scatter method code remains the same
```

This modification ensures that the `linewidths` parameter is appropriately handled and sets the linewidth of the marker edges as expected. The rest of the code remains unchanged. After making this correction, the test cases should pass without any assertion errors.
