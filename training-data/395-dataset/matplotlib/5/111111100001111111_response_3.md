The issue reported by the user is related to the `scatter` method in Matplotlib, where the `linewidths` parameter does not seem to work as expected. The user is trying to change the thickness of the marker "x" when using the scatter plot.

Upon reviewing the input and expected output values for several test cases, the issue appears to be related to the handling of the `linewidths` parameter within the `scatter` method.

The issue seems to be occurring because the `linewidths` parameter is not being used correctly within the `scatter` method. Instead of a single value, it is expected to be a scalar or an array-like of the same size as `x` and `y`.

To fix this issue, the `scatter` method should be modified to handle the `linewidths` parameter correctly.

Here is the corrected function:

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    """
    A scatter plot of *y* vs. *x* with varying marker size and/or color.

    :param x: float or array-like, shape (n, )
    :param y: float or array-like, shape (n, )
    :param linewidths: float or array-like, default: :rc:`lines.linewidth`
    :param kwargs: `~matplotlib.collections.Collection` properties

    :return: `~matplotlib.collections.PathCollection`
    """

    #... existing code ...

    if linewidths is None:
        linewidths = rcParams['lines.linewidth']
    else:
        linewidths = np.ma.ravel(linewidths)
        if len(linewidths) not in (1, x.size):
            raise ValueError("linewidths must be a scalar, or the same size as x and y")

    #... existing code ...
```

In the modified function, we first check if the `linewidths` parameter is None. If it is not None, we convert it to a NumPy masked array using `np.ma.ravel`. Then, we check if the length of `linewidths` is 1 or the same as `x`. If it is not, a ValueError is raised.

This modification ensures that the `linewidths` parameter is handled correctly, allowing it to be a scalar or an array-like of the same size as `x` and `y`, as expected. With this change, the `scatter` method should work as intended, and the marker thickness for "x" should be adjustable.
