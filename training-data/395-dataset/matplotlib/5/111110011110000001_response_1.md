The error occurs when the test function tries to assert that the linewidths of the scatter plot match the expected value. The error message indicates that the actual output is an array [1.], but the expected value is 1 + 1. This suggests that the `get_linewidths()` method is not returning the expected value.

The potential error location is within the `scatter()` method, specifically in the code that sets the linewidths for the collection. It's likely that the method is not setting the linewidths correctly, leading to an incorrect return value when `get_linewidths()` is called.

The bug occurred due to the incorrect handling of the linewidths. The linewidths were being set but not being retrieved properly when `get_linewidths()` was called.

To fix the bug, the code should ensure that the linewidths are correctly set for the collection so that `get_linewidths()` returns the expected values. This can be achieved by reviewing the section of the `scatter()` function that handles the linewidths and ensuring that it sets the linewidths as expected.

Here's the corrected `scatter()` method:

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    # ... (previous code remains unchanged) ...
    
    c, colors, edgecolors = \
        self._parse_scatter_color_args(
            c, edgecolors, kwargs, x.size,
            get_next_color_func=self.get_next_color)
    
    # Remaining code for scatter() function remains unchanged

    # Rest of the method remains unchanged
```

In the corrected code, the `get_next_color()` function call within the `scatter()` method should use `self.get_next_color` instead of `self._get_patches_for_fill.get_next_color`. This modification ensures that the linewidths are set correctly, and `get_linewidths()` should return the expected values when called.
