The issue seems to be related to the `linewidths` parameter not working as expected in newer versions of Matplotlib (version 3.1.0).

The cause of the problem might be due to changes in the implementation of the `scatter` method in Matplotlib, which might have impacted the handling of the `linewidths` parameter.

To fix the issue, we should ensure that the `linewidths` parameter is handled correctly within the `scatter` method.

Here's the corrected code for the `scatter` method:

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False, **kwargs):
    """
    A scatter plot of *y* vs. *x* with varying marker size and/or color.
    ...
    """

    # Existing method implementation goes here...

    if linewidths is not None:
        linewidths = np.ma.ravel(linewidths)
        if len(linewidths) not in (1, x.size):
            raise ValueError("linewidths must be a scalar, or the same size as x and y")

    # Existing method implementation continues...

    # Code for handling the linewidths parameter is added or modified above.

    # Rest of the existing method implementation...
``` 

In the modified code for the `scatter` method, we are specifically handling the `linewidths` parameter to ensure that it works as intended. If the `linewidths` parameter is not `None`, we check if it is a scalar or has the same size as `x` and `y`, and raise a `ValueError` if it does not meet these criteria. This updated handling of the `linewidths` parameter should address the issue with its behavior in the newer versions of Matplotlib.
