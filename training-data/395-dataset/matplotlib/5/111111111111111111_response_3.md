The bug appears to be related to the `scatter` method in the `Axes` class, particularly the handling of the `linewidths` parameter. The error message indicates that the method `pc.get_linewidths()` did not return the expected value, leading to an assertion error.

The `scatter` method currently has a condition `edgecolors: {'face', 'none', *None*} or color or sequence of color, default: rc:scatter.edgecolors` which includes a setting for the edge color of the marker. This setting may be interfering with how the line width is being rendered and interacted with.

The bug is likely occurring due to changes in the implementation of the `scatter` method in newer versions of Matplotlib. The older version (1.3.1) might have had a different implementation of the `scatter` method, causing the `linewidths` parameter to work differently.

To fix the bug, you can modify the `scatter` method to ensure that the `linewidths` parameter is correctly handling the width of the marker edge. This may involve updating the logic around how the edge color and line width are processed.

Here's the corrected code for the `scatter` method:

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    # ... (existing code) ...

    # At the beginning of the method, check if linewidths is a valid entry
    if linewidths is not None:
        if not isinstance(linewidths, list):
            linewidths = [linewidths] * len(x)  # Set a default width if it's a single value

    # Later in the code, apply linewidths to the marker
    if linewidths is not None:
        kwargs['linewidths'] = linewidths

    # ... (existing code) ...
```

This modification includes handling the `linewidths` parameter at the beginning of the method, ensuring it is a valid entry, and later applying it to the marker as desired.

By making these changes, the `scatter` method should handle the `linewidths` parameter correctly, resolving the issue observed in the test case.
