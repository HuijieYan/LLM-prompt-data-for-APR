The error message indicates that the `get_linewidths()` method is returning a method object instead of the expected linewidth value.

The potential error location is within the `scatter` method in the `Axes` class. It seems that the method `get_linewidths()` is not being called correctly or returning the expected value.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `get_linewidths()` method is not returning the correct value, which causes the test to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `scatter` method to ensure that the `get_linewidths()` method returns the correct linewidth value.

Here's the corrected `scatter` method:

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    # ... (existing code) ...

    # Process **kwargs to handle aliases, conflicts with explicit kwargs:
    self._process_unit_info(xdata=x, ydata=y, kwargs=kwargs)
    x = self.convert_xunits(x)
    y = self.convert_yunits(y)

    # Rest of the code remains the same

    # Ensure that the linewidths are set correctly
    collection.set_linewidths(linewidths)

    # ... (existing code) ...
    
    return collection
```

In the corrected code, after setting the `linewidths` variable, the `set_linewidths()` function is called on the `collection` to ensure that the linewidths are set correctly for the scatter plot. This should fix the bug and ensure that the `get_linewidths()` method returns the expected value.
