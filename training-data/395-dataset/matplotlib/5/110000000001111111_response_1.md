The issue is with the `scatter` method in the provided code where the `linewidths` parameter is not functioning as expected. 

It seems that the bug is occurring due to the incorrect handling of the `linewidths` parameter and the subsequent processing of data based on this parameter.

To fix the bug, a potential approach is to ensure that the `linewidths` parameter is correctly used to set the width of the marker edges, and the subsequent processing of the data in the function should take this into account.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False, **kwargs):
    # Existing code
    
    # ... (previous implementation code)

    # Check for linewidths parameter and set marker properties accordingly
    if linewidths is not None:
        edgecolors = 'k'  # set edge color to black
        linewidths = np.atleast_1d(linewidths)  # convert to 1D array
    else:
        linewidths = rcParams['lines.linewidth']  # set to default linewidth

    # ... (continued implementation code)
```

In the corrected code, the `linewidths` parameter is properly handled, and the edge color is explicitly set to black when the `linewidths` parameter is provided.

With this fix, the `linewidths` parameter should work as expected for the marker "x" in the scatter plot.
