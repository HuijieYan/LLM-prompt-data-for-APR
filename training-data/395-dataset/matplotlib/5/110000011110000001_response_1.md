The error message from the test function indicates that the `get_linewidths()` method called on the PathCollection object `pc` is returning an array when it is expected to return a scalar value.

The potential error location within the `scatter` method is likely in the block of code where the `linewidths` argument is handled.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `linewidths` argument is not being processed correctly, leading to unexpected behavior when trying to retrieve the linewidths using `get_linewidths()`.

To fix the bug, the code for processing the `linewidths` argument needs to be modified so that it correctly handles both scalar and array-like inputs.

Here's the corrected `scatter` method:

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    # Existing code...

    if linewidths is None:
        linewidths = rcParams['lines.linewidth']
    else:
        try:
            linewidths = float(linewidths)
        except (ValueError, TypeError):
            pass

    # Existing code...
    return collection
```

In this correction, we first check if `linewidths` is None. If it is, we set it to the default linewidth value from `rcParams`. Otherwise, we attempt to convert `linewidths` to a float and handle any potential errors. This ensures that `linewidths` is properly processed and that the subsequent call to `get_linewidths()` will return a scalar value as expected.
