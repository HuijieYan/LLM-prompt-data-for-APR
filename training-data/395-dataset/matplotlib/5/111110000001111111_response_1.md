The problem is caused by the `linewidths` parameter not properly handling a scalar value. This is due to an incorrect check for the length of `s` not being consistent with `x` and `y`. Additionally, the test cases show that the calculated `linewidths` is being converted into a list.

To fix this bug, the `linewidths` parameter should be handled properly to ensure its consistency with `x`, `y`, and `s`. Scalar values should not be converted into a list, and the internal calculations should be corrected.

Here's the corrected code for the `scatter` function:

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False, **kwargs):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged) ...

    if s.size not in (1, x.size):
        raise ValueError("s must be a scalar, or the same size as x and y")
    if not np.iterable(linewidths):
        linewidths = [linewidths] * s.size
    
    # ... (remaining code remains unchanged) ...
```
