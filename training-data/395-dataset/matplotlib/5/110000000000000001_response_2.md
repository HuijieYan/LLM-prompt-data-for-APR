The potential error in the given function is that the decorator @_preprocess_data and @cbook._delete_parameter are not defined in the code. This can be the reason behind the bug.

To fix this issue, the decorators @_preprocess_data and @cbook._delete_parameter should be defined and implemented in the code.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
            **kwargs):
    """
    A scatter plot of *y* vs. *x* with varying marker size and/or color.
    (rest of the code here)
    """
    # rest of the code remains the same
```
