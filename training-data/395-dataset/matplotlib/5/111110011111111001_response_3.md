The error in the `scatter` function is occurring because the `pc.get_linewidths()` method is returning a numpy array, which is not equal to `i + 1`, resulting in an assertion error.

The potential error in the `scatter` function is likely to be in the logic that calculates the linewidths and assigns them to the `PathCollection`.

The bug occurred because the computation of the linewidths and the method for retrieving the linewidths were not returning the expected results. This could be due to incorrect handling of different input types for `linewidths` and potential issues with the logic for combining masks and handling masked arrays.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to ensure that the logic for computing linewidths based on different input types (int, list, None) is handling all cases appropriately, then verify that the `pc.get_linewidths()` method returns the expected values.

Here's the corrected `scatter` function:

```python
# Assuming the original function is inside a class definition
class Axes(_AxesBase):
    
    # ...omitted code...
    
    @_preprocess_data(replace_names=["x", "y", "s", "linewidths",
                                     "edgecolors", "c", "facecolor",
                                     "facecolors", "color"],
                      label_namer="y")
    @cbook._delete_parameter("3.2", "verts")
    def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
                vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
                verts=None, edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False,
                **kwargs):
        # ... existing implementation ...

        if isinstance(linewidths, (int, float)):  # Single linewidth value
            linewidths = [linewidths] * x.size
        if linewidths is None:
            linewidths = mpl.rcParams['lines.linewidth']
        if any(linewidths) is None:  # Replace None with default value
            linewidths = [lw if lw is not None else mpl.rcParams['lines.linewidth'] for lw in linewidths]

        # Existing logic for other properties...

        # rest of the function

        return collection
```
In this corrected code, we handle the input `linewidths` of different types appropriately to ensure that it is always returned as a list where None values are replaced with the default linewidth value. This should address the issue and make the function return the expected results for the given test case.
