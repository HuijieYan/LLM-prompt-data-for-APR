The error in the `scatter` method arises because the `get_linewidths` method returns a method rather than the expected value. This issue causes the test to fail, as it attempts to compare the method to an integer, leading to an assertion error.

The reason for this behavior is that the `scatter` method does not handle the `linewidths` parameter correctly, causing it to return the method instead of the linewidth values.

To fix this bug, the `scatter` method should be modified to handle the `linewidths` parameter correctly and return the expected linewidth values instead of the method.

Below is the corrected code for the `scatter` method that addresses the bug:

```python
def scatter(self, x, y, s=None, c=None, marker=None, cmap=None, norm=None,
            vmin=None, vmax=None, alpha=None, linewidths=None,
            edgecolors=None, *, plotnonfinite=False, **kwargs):
    """
    A scatter plot of *y* vs. *x* with varying marker size and/or color.
    """

    # Existing code...

    linewidths = np.broadcast_to(linewidths, x.size)  # Ensure linewidths is broadcasted to the size of x
    # After processing linewidths, continue with the existing logic

    return collection
```

In the corrected code, we use `np.broadcast_to` to ensure that the `linewidths` parameter is broadcasted to the size of `x`. This modification allows the `scatter` method to handle `linewidths` correctly and return the expected linewidth values, resolving the bug.
