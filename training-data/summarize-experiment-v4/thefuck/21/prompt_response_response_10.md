## The corrected code for the buggy function

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    current_script = command.script.split()
    if len(current_script) < 2:
        return False
    return (current_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By adding a condition to check if the split script is shorter than 2 elements and returning `False` in that scenario, the index error can be avoided. This updated function will address the bug and resolve the GitHub issue.
