## The corrected code for the buggy function

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script.split()
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

In the corrected version, the error in the original condition has been fixed. The script is now split and checked for the presence of 'stash' in any part of the split script. This addresses the issue and ensures that the function passes the failing test and satisfies the expected input/output variable information.
