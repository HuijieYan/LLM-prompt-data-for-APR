## The corrected code for the buggy function

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) >= 2:
        return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```

By adding a check to ensure that the split command has at least 2 elements before accessing the second element, we can avoid the IndexError. This will ensure that the function does not try to access an element that doesn't exist in the split result.
