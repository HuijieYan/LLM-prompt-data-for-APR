The bug in the `match` function is caused by the assumption that `command.script` always has at least 2 elements when split. However, this assumption is not always true, leading to an IndexError when attempting to access the second element of the split list.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if `command.script` can be successfully split into at least 2 elements before attempting to access the second element.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 
            and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this correction, the function will first check if the split of `command.script` contains at least 2 elements. If it does, it will then check if the second element is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is present in `command.stderr`. This fix ensures that the code will not attempt to access an index that doesn't exist, resolving the IndexError issue.
