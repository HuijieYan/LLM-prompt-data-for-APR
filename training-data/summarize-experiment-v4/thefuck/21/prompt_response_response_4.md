The bug is caused by the assumption that the command script will always contain at least two parts after splitting. This leads to an IndexError when accessing the second part of the split script, resulting in a mismatch when comparing it to 'stash'.

To fix the bug, handle the case when the split script does not contain enough parts to prevent the IndexError. Then, check if the script contains 'stash' and if the stderr contains 'usage:'.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) > 1:
        return (split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```

This code first splits the command script and then checks if the split_parts list contains at least two elements before comparing the second part to 'stash'. If there are not enough parts, it returns False. This approach fixes the bug and should satisfy the expected input/output variable information and successfully resolves the issue posted on GitHub.
