## The corrected code for the buggy function

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[0] == 'git'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr
            and 'stash' in command.script)
```

The bug in the original code occurred because the script was being split at a whitespace, but then the second element was being accessed directly without checking if it exists. In the corrected code, the split is checked against 'git' rather than 'stash' and also checks whether the word 'stash' exists in the script to prevent the IndexError from occurring.

This correction ensures that the function passes the failing test and satisfies the expected input/output variable information.
