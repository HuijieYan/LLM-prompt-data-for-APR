## The corrected code for the buggy function

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script == 'git'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

Approach for fixing the bug:
The bug is caused by the line `command.script.split()[1]`, which attempts to split the script and access the second element without checking if it exists. We can fix this bug by simply checking if the script is exactly equal to 'git' and then checking if 'usage:' is in the stderr. This will prevent the IndexError from occurring and provide the correct behavior for the function.

The corrected code addresses the issue by directly comparing the `command.script` to 'git' and checking if 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`. This change ensures that the function will return `True` only if the script is 'git' and the stderr contains 'usage:', as expected.
