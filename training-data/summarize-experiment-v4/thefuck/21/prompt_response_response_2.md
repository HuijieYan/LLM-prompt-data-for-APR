## The corrected code for the buggy function

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    return (len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This corrected code includes a check to ensure that the split list has at least two elements before attempting to access the second element. This prevents the "IndexError" that was occurring due to trying to access an element that does not exist in the list. With this check in place, the function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information and successfully resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
