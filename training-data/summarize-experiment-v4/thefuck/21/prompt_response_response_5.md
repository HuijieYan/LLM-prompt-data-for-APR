## The corrected code for the buggy function

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script.split()
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
Fixed the bug by checking if 'stash' is in the split command script rather than trying to access a specific index. This should resolve the `IndexError` and correctly identify if 'stash' is in the command script.
