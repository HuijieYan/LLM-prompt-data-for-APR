## The corrected code for the buggy function

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return ('stash' in command.script 
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By modifying the match function, we can fix the bug and ensure that it returns True if the script contains 'stash' and the stderr contains 'usage:'. This change will address the issue outlined in the GitHub post and prevent the IndexError raised in the previous version of the function.
