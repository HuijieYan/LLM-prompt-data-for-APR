The potential error within the buggy function is the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. Currently, the command 'fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'' is returning additional text that is not needed.

The cause of the bug is that the command 'fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'' is returning 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9' instead of the expected output '3.5.9', causing a mismatch with the expected output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'.

To fix the bug, the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell should be modified to only return the version number without extra text.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    # Get only the version number without additional text
    version = version.replace('Fish Shell fish, version ', '')  
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this fix, the function will now properly retrieve and return the version of the Fish shell as expected.
