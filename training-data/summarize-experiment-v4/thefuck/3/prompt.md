## The source code of the buggy function

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache
```

The buggy function is under file: `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/bgp_envs_local/repos/thefuck_3/thefuck/shells/fish.py`

Here is the buggy function:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)

```


## Summary of Related Functions

`Popen()` function call: Executes a command in a subshell and returns a tuple containing file objects representing the standard output and error streams of the child process. In this case, it is used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

`u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)`: Constructs a string representing the name and version of the Fish shell.

The `info()` function is likely intended to return the name and version of the current shell, retrieved using the `Popen()` function to execute a command in the shell.


## Summary of the test cases and error messages

The failing test for the `info` method of the Fish shell returns an AssertionError on line 118 due to a mismatch between the expected output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' and the actual output 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'. This mismatch is caused by the use of the wrong command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell in the `info` function. The stack trace shows that the call to Popen with the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` is not returning the expected output, leading to the failed assertion.


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The relevant input/output values are:
- Input parameters: None
- Output: version (value: '3.5.9', type: str)
Rational: The function is expected to return the version of the current shell, but it is not properly handling input parameters or error conditions. Also, the return type of the function is not as expected.


## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

Case 1: Given the input parameters, there are no input parameters in the function code provided, so we cannot test it for different input values. However, the expected output from the function should be the name and version of the Fish Shell, such as "Fish Shell 3.5.9".

The function is expected to return a string containing the name and version of the current shell. The version is obtained by running the command "fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'" and capturing the output. Therefore, the expected value for version in this case is 'fish, version 3.5.9', and the expected type is str.

The variable proc is a MagicMock object representing the Popen call, and the expected type is MagicMock.

The variable proc.stdout.read is a MagicMock object representing the read method call on the stdout attribute of the Popen object. The expected type is MagicMock.

The variable proc.stdout is a MagicMock object representing the stdout attribute of the Popen object. The expected type is MagicMock.


## A GitHub issue for this bug

The issue's title:
```text
thefuck -v hangs Fish Shell initialisation with Oh-My-Fish plugin
```

The issue's detailed description:
```text
Oh-My-Fish's TheFuck plugin uses thefuck -v to decide when to regenerate functions. That triggers a recursive loop because of shells/fish.py:Fish.info().

Fix is on it's way.
