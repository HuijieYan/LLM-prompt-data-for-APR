Case 1: Given the input parameters, there are no input parameters in the function code provided, so we cannot test it for different input values. However, the expected output from the function should be the name and version of the Fish Shell, such as "Fish Shell 3.5.9".

The function is expected to return a string containing the name and version of the current shell. The version is obtained by running the command "fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'" and capturing the output. Therefore, the expected value for version in this case is 'fish, version 3.5.9', and the expected type is str.

The variable proc is a MagicMock object representing the Popen call, and the expected type is MagicMock.

The variable proc.stdout.read is a MagicMock object representing the read method call on the stdout attribute of the Popen object. The expected type is MagicMock.

The variable proc.stdout is a MagicMock object representing the stdout attribute of the Popen object. The expected type is MagicMock.
