The potential error location within the buggy function is the line:
```python
version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
```

The bug's cause is due to the incorrect command being used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell in the `info` function. The command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` is not returning the expected output, leading to the failed assertion.

Approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Changing the command to properly retrieve the Fish shell version.
2. Handling error and edge cases, such as when the version retrieval fails or encounters an unexpected output.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-v'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[2]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected code uses the command `fish -v` to retrieve the version of the Fish shell and then extracts the version from the command output. This should resolve the issue by returning the expected version of the Fish shell.
