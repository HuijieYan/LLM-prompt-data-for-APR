The cause of the bug is that the command being executed by the Popen function to retrieve the version of the Fish shell is incorrect. This leads to a mismatch between the expected and actual version outputs. The `info` function is expected to return the name and version of the Fish shell, but it is not properly handling the command execution and return type.

To fix the bug, the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version should be used in the `info` function. Additionally, the function should handle error conditions properly and return the expected output type.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the `info` function should now return the expected output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. Additionally, this fix should address the issue posted on GitHub related to the recursive loop triggered by the `info` function.
