`Popen()` function call: Executes a command in a subshell and returns a tuple containing file objects representing the standard output and error streams of the child process. In this case, it is used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

`u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)`: Constructs a string representing the name and version of the Fish shell.

The `info()` function is likely intended to return the name and version of the current shell, retrieved using the `Popen()` function to execute a command in the shell.
