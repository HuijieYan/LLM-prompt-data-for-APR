The potential error in the buggy function is the command used within the Popen call to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. The command `'fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` is not returning the expected output, leading to a failed assertion in the test.

The bug is caused by the incorrect command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell in the `info` function. This causes the returned version to contain extra information that differs from the expected output, leading to the failing test and assertion error.

To fix the bug, the command used in the Popen call should be modified to accurately retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected code, the command used in the Popen call is `['fish', '--version']`, which accurately retrieves the version of the Fish shell. This resolves the issue and ensures that the function returns the expected output: the name and version of the Fish shell.
