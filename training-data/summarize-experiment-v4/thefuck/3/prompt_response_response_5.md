The potential error in the buggy function is the command executed using Popen to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. The command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` is not returning the expected output, leading to a failed test case.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
- Since the expected output of the version is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', the command passed to Popen should be modified to directly retrieve this version information.
- Additionally, the code should handle potential error conditions, such as checking for the existence of the Fish shell or handling exceptions raised by Popen.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except Exception as e:
        return 'Fish Shell version information not available'
```

In the corrected code:
- The command passed to Popen has been changed to `fish --version` to directly retrieve the version information of the Fish shell.
- The code is wrapped in a try-except block to catch any potential exceptions raised by Popen and return a message indicating that the version information is not available.

This new implementation ensures that the correct version of the Fish shell is retrieved, and it handles potential error conditions. This corrected code should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and pass the failing test case.
