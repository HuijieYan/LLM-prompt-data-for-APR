The potential error location within the buggy function is the Popen call, specifically the command 'fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION''. The command may not be returning the expected output, leading to the failed test case.

The bug is causing the `info` function to return an unexpected version string. It is expected to return the name and version of the Fish shell, but the Popen call with the command 'fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'' is not returning the expected output. This results in a mismatch between the expected and actual output, leading to the failed test case.

To fix the bug, the command used in the Popen call should be updated to correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell. The expected output is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', and the command should be modified to return this value. Additionally, error handling should be added to handle potential issues with the Popen call.

Here is the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'fish --version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except Exception as e:
        return 'Error retrieving Fish shell version: {}'.format(str(e))
```

In this corrected code, the command used in the Popen call has been updated to 'fish --version' to correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell. Error handling has also been added to catch any exceptions that may occur during the Popen call. This updated code should resolve the issue and ensure that the `info` function returns the expected output.
