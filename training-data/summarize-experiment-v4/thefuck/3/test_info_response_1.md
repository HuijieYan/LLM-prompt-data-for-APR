The failing test for the `info` method of the Fish shell returns an AssertionError on line 118 due to a mismatch between the expected output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' and the actual output 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'. This mismatch is caused by the use of the wrong command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell in the `info` function. The stack trace shows that the call to Popen with the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` is not returning the expected output, leading to the failed assertion.
