## The source code of the buggy function

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support
```

The buggy function is under file: `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/bgp_envs_local/repos/thefuck_9/thefuck/rules/git_push.py`

Here is the buggy function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index is not -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)

```


## Summary of the test cases and error messages

The error seems to be originating on line 27 in the file git_push.py, where the pop method is called on an empty list; this results in an IndexError. It seems that the function get_new_command is expecting upstream_option_index to be a non-negative integer, but it is always initialized as -1, which can lead to unexpected behavior. This can be verified and further investigated by checking the get_new_command function.


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

As per the runtime information, the relevant input/output values that are likely relevant to the bug are:

- Input parameters: command.script_parts, value: ['git', 'push', '-u'], type: list
- Output: push_upstream, value: 'push --set-upstream origin master', type: str

Rational: The bug seems to be related to the incorrect processing of the input parameters related to the upstream option index and the resulting value for push_upstream. The function is not correctly removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options from the command.script_parts and the resulting push_upstream value is erroneous.


## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

Case 1: Given the input parameters `command.script_parts=['git', 'push']`, `command=Command(script=git push, stdout=, stderr=fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch. To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use  git push --set-upstream origin master )`, and `command.stderr='fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.\nTo push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use  git push --set-upstream origin master\n\n'`, the function should return `push --set-upstream origin master`. This might be calculated by removing the '--set-upstream' and '-u', finding the string after 'git' in the stderr, and replacing 'push' in the command script with the extracted string.

## A GitHub issue for this bug

The issue's title:
```text
#538 broke git push -u myfork suggestions
```

The issue's detailed description:
```text
For example:

[josephfrazier@Josephs-MacBook-Pro ~/workspace/thefuck] (tmp) $
git push -u josephfrazier
fatal: The current branch tmp has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream josephfrazier tmp

[josephfrazier@Josephs-MacBook-Pro ~/workspace/thefuck] (tmp) $
fuck
hub push --set-upstream josephfrazier tmp -u josephfrazier [enter/↑/↓/ctrl+c]
Instead, the suggestion should be git push --set-upstream josephfrazier tmp, like it was before #538 was merged. I'll see if I can put together a fix for this.
