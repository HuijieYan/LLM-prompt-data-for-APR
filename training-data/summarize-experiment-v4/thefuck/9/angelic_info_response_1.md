Case 1: Given the input parameters `command.script_parts=['git', 'push']`, `command=Command(script=git push, stdout=, stderr=fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch. To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use  git push --set-upstream origin master )`, and `command.stderr='fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.\nTo push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use  git push --set-upstream origin master\n\n'`, the function should return `push --set-upstream origin master`. This might be calculated by removing the '--set-upstream' and '-u', finding the string after 'git' in the stderr, and replacing 'push' in the command script with the extracted string.
