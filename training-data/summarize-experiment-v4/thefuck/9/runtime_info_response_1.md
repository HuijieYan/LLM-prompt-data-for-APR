As per the runtime information, the relevant input/output values that are likely relevant to the bug are:

- Input parameters: command.script_parts, value: ['git', 'push', '-u'], type: list
- Output: push_upstream, value: 'push --set-upstream origin master', type: str

Rational: The bug seems to be related to the incorrect processing of the input parameters related to the upstream option index and the resulting value for push_upstream. The function is not correctly removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options from the command.script_parts and the resulting push_upstream value is erroneous.
