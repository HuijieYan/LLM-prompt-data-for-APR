The error seems to be originating on line 27 in the file git_push.py, where the pop method is called on an empty list; this results in an IndexError. It seems that the function get_new_command is expecting upstream_option_index to be a non-negative integer, but it is always initialized as -1, which can lead to unexpected behavior. This can be verified and further investigated by checking the get_new_command function.
