The potential error location within the buggy function is in the if statement that checks if `upstream_option_index` is not equal to -1. 

The bug's cause is that the function is not correctly removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options from the `command.script_parts` list and the resulting `push_upstream` value is erroneous. This causes unexpected behavior and can lead to an IndexError when trying to pop elements from an empty list if the options are not present.

To fix the bug, the `try-except` blocks should be replaced with conditional statements to check for the presence of '--set-upstream' or '-u' options separately. Additionally, the index changes when the first option is removed, so a recursive call to `get_new_command` should be used to update the command after removing the first option.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('--set-upstream')
        return get_new_command(command)
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        command.script_parts.remove('-u')
        return get_new_command(command)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this corrected code, the program should pass the failing test and successfully resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
