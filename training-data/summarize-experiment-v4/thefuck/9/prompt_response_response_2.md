The potential error location within the buggy function is the conditional check for `upstream_option_index`. The bug is caused by this condition and the subsequent code that tries to remove the `--set-upstream` and `-u` options from the `command.script_parts` list.

The failing test case and corresponding error message indicate that the `pop` method is being called on an empty list, causing an IndexError. This points to the fact that the `upstream_option_index` is not being properly set or checked before trying to pop elements from the list.

To fix the bug, we should update the code to properly handle the case when `upstream_option_index` is not found. This could involve checking if the index is valid before trying to remove elements from the list.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        if len(command.script_parts) > upstream_option_index + 1:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index + 1)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With this correction, the `get_new_command` function should now properly handle the removal of `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the `command.script_parts` list and handle the case when the options are not found. This should resolve the issue of the function failing when processing input parameters with these options.
