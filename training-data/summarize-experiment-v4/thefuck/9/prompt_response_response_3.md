The potential error location in the buggy function is the incorrect handling of the upstream_option_index, as well as the incorrect extraction of the push_upstream value from the command.stderr.

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the upstream_option_index, causing unexpected behavior and an erroneous push_upstream value.

To fix the bug, the handling of the upstream_option_index needs to be revised, and the extraction of the push_upstream value needs to be adjusted to ensure correctness.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code addresses the bug by properly handling the removal of the --set-upstream or -u options and their respective arguments from the command.script_parts. It also adjusts the extraction of the push_upstream value to ensure correctness.

This corrected code should resolve the issue posted on GitHub and ensure that the function passes the failing test case.
