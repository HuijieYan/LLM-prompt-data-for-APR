## The corrected code for the buggy function

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)        
        # Update the upstream_option_index after the first pop
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream') if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts else -1
        if upstream_option_index != -1:
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

By updating the upstream_option_index after the first pop operation, we can ensure that the correct index is used for the subsequent removal of '--set-upstream'. This change addresses the bug where the pop method is called on an empty list, resulting in an IndexError. With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the removal of '--set-upstream' and '-u' options from the command.script_parts and the resulting push_upstream value should be accurate. This should resolve the issue reported in GitHub and ensure that the function passes the failing test case.
