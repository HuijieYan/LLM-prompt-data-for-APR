The bug in the `get_new_command` function is that the conditional check for `upstream_option_index` is incorrect and leading to unexpected behavior. The value `upstream_option_index` is always being initialized as -1 and then immediately updated without proper conditional checks. As a result, the function does not correctly remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options from the `command.script_parts`. This leads to an incorrect value for `push_upstream`.

To fix this bug, the conditional check for `upstream_option_index` needs to be updated to handle both scenarios where '--set-upstream' or '-u' may be present. Additionally, the pop method should only be called if the index is found and is valid to prevent IndexError.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # pop the argument as well

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
With this fix, the program should now pass the failing test case and produce the correct expected output.
