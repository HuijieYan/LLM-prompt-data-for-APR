## Bug Analysis and Cause

The bug in the `convert_image` function seems to be related to the conditional block that handles transparent RGBA images. It incorrectly attempts to convert the image to 'RGB' without correctly handling the background, leading to discrepancies in the expected and actual images.

The failing test at line 105 indicates that the expected and actual RGB values returned by `converted.getcolors()` are different. This suggests an issue in the conditional conversion block that handles transparent RGBA images.

The function incorrectly converts the image to 'RGB' mode without handling the background correctly, resulting in discrepancies between the expected and actual images.

## Bug Fix

To fix the bug, the conditional block that handles transparent RGBA images needs to be revised to correctly handle the background and convert the image to 'RGB' mode. Additionally, the resizing logic should be checked to ensure it correctly handles the size parameter.

Moreover, the input image's format and mode should be thoroughly checked to ensure the correct conversion and resizing operations are applied.

## Corrected Code

Here is the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from typing import Tuple
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None) -> Tuple[Image, BytesIO]:
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In this corrected code:
- The conditional block handling transparent RGBA images has been revised to create a new RGB background and paste the original image onto it.
- The conversion to 'RGB' mode now correctly handles the background and the actual conversion of the image.
- The resizing logic remains unchanged, ensuring that the image is resized correctly if a size parameter is provided.
- The corrected code should now pass the failing test and ensure that the function satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided.
