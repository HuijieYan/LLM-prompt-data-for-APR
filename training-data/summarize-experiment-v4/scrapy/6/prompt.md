## The source code of the buggy function

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
from PIL import Image
from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO
```

The buggy function is under file: `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/bgp_envs_local/repos/scrapy_6/scrapy/pipelines/images.py`

Here is the buggy function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf

```


## Summary of Related Functions

Class docstring: This class is an abstract pipeline that implements image thumbnail generation logic.

`def convert_image(self, image, size=None) -> Tuple[Image, BytesIO]`: This function takes an image and an optional size parameter. It checks the format and mode of the image and converts it if necessary. If a size is provided, it resizes the image and saves it as a JPEG. Finally, it returns the modified image and a buffer.

The `Image` class and its methods like `new`, `paste`, `convert`, `thumbnail`, and `save`: These methods are likely used to manipulate the image and perform operations such as creating a new image, pasting images, converting image formats, resizing images, and saving images.

`FilesPipeline` class: This class is likely the parent class that provides additional functionality for working with files in the pipeline.

Other functions within the `ImagesPipeline` class: It's possible that there are other methods within the `ImagesPipeline` class that interact with the `convert_image` function, such as storing the image or handling errors.


## Summary of the test cases and error messages

The failing test is `test_convert_image` in `tests/test_pipeline_images.py`. The error message is a comparison failure at line 105, indicating that the expected and actual RGB values returned by `converted.getcolors()` are different. This discrepancy relates to the `convert_image` function and suggests an issue in the conditional conversion block that handles transparent RGBA images.


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The relevant input/output values are:
- Case 3:
  - input parameters:
    - image.format, value: 'PNG', type: str
    - image.mode, value: 'RGBA', type: str
    - image.size, value: (100, 100), type: tuple
  - relevant variables:
    - image, value: <PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGB size=100x100 at 0x7F2A1E7A7BB0>, type: Image
    - image.mode, value: 'RGB', type: str
    - background, value: <PIL.Image.Image image mode=RGBA size=100x100 at 0x7F2A1E7A7B80>, type: Image

Rational: The relevant input/output values show that when the input image has format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA', the function is not correctly converting it to RGB mode. This matches the suspected bug in the original function.


## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

In the given example, the buggy function `convert_image` takes an image as input and converts it to a specified format and size. However, the implementation has several issues in determining the new format and size. 

Case 1: When the input image format is 'JPEG', the function should return the image in its original format and size. However, the function incorrectly attempts to convert the image to 'JPEG' format, resulting in a mismatch between the expected and actual format.

Case 2: Similar to case 1, when a size is specified, the function incorrectly resizes the image to the specified dimensions, resulting in a mismatch between the expected and actual size.

Case 3: When the input image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA', the function should convert the image to 'RGB' format and return the modified image. However, the function incorrectly converts the image to 'RGB' without handling the background correctly, leading to discrepancies between the expected and actual images.

Case 4: When the input image mode is not 'RGB', the function should convert the image to 'RGB' mode and return the modified image. However, the function incorrectly converts the image mode without handling the conversion properly, leading to discrepancies between the expected and actual images.

Overall, the function has issues with correctly handling image format, mode, and resizing, resulting in incorrect outputs for various input cases.
