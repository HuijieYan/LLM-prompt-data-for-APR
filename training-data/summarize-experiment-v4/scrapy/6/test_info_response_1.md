The failing test is `test_convert_image` in `tests/test_pipeline_images.py`. The error message is a comparison failure at line 105, indicating that the expected and actual RGB values returned by `converted.getcolors()` are different. This discrepancy relates to the `convert_image` function and suggests an issue in the conditional conversion block that handles transparent RGBA images.
