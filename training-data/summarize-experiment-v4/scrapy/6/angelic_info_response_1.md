In the given example, the buggy function `convert_image` takes an image as input and converts it to a specified format and size. However, the implementation has several issues in determining the new format and size. 

Case 1: When the input image format is 'JPEG', the function should return the image in its original format and size. However, the function incorrectly attempts to convert the image to 'JPEG' format, resulting in a mismatch between the expected and actual format.

Case 2: Similar to case 1, when a size is specified, the function incorrectly resizes the image to the specified dimensions, resulting in a mismatch between the expected and actual size.

Case 3: When the input image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA', the function should convert the image to 'RGB' format and return the modified image. However, the function incorrectly converts the image to 'RGB' without handling the background correctly, leading to discrepancies between the expected and actual images.

Case 4: When the input image mode is not 'RGB', the function should convert the image to 'RGB' mode and return the modified image. However, the function incorrectly converts the image mode without handling the conversion properly, leading to discrepancies between the expected and actual images.

Overall, the function has issues with correctly handling image format, mode, and resizing, resulting in incorrect outputs for various input cases.
