## Bug Cause

The bug is caused by the conditional block that handles transparent RGBA images. When the input image has format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA', the function fails to correctly handle the transparency (alpha) channel and the background when converting to 'RGB'. This results in discrepancies between the expected and actual output images.

## Approach for Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional block that handles transparent RGBA images to correctly handle the transparency and background when converting to 'RGB'. Additionally, we should ensure that the function properly handles image format, mode, and resizing for different input cases to align with the expected output.

## The corrected code for the buggy function
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
      
    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With the corrected code, the conditional block now handles transparent RGBA images by creating a new RGB background and pasting the RGBA image onto it, effectively handling the transparency. Additionally, the function properly handles image format, mode, and resizing for different input cases to ensure correct outputs. This corrected code should address the issues identified with the original buggy function.
