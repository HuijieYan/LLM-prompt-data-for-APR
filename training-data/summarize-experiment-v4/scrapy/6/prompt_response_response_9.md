## Bug's cause

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of transparent RGBA images when converting them to RGB format in the `convert_image` function. The conditional block that checks for the image format and mode is not implementing the background handling and conversion properly, leading to discrepancies between the expected and actual image outputs.

## Approach for fixing the bug

To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional conversion block to correctly handle transparent RGBA images and properly convert them to RGB format with a white background. Additionally, we should ensure that the resizing logic works as intended for different image sizes.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a new RGBA image with white background
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the above fix:
1. For transparent RGBA images, we create a new RGB image with a white background and paste the original image onto it. This ensures that transparency is handled correctly when converting to RGB format.
2. For images that are not in RGB mode, we simply convert them to RGB format.
3. We retain the resizing logic to handle the optional `size` parameter for image thumbnail generation.
4. Finally, we save the modified image to a buffer and return both the modified image and the buffer.

With the above fix, the `convert_image` function should now correctly handle image format, mode, and resizing, ensuring that it produces the expected outputs for various input cases and passes the failing test.
