## Bug Analysis

The bug in the `convert_image` function arises from the incorrect handling of PNG images with RGBA mode, leading to an incorrect conversion to RGB mode without properly handling the transparent background. This results in discrepancies between the expected and actual images, causing the failing test and comparison failures.

## Bug Location
The bug likely occurs in the conditional block that handles the conversion of PNG images with RGBA mode and other non-RGB modes. It incorrectly converts the image to RGB mode without properly handling the transparency.

## Bug Cause
The cause of the bug is the mishandling of PNG images with RGBA mode. The function does not correctly handle the transparency when converting the image to RGB mode, leading to discrepancies in the expected and actual images.

## Approach to Fix
To fix the bug, the function needs to properly handle PNG images with RGBA mode by creating a white background and pasting the original image onto it before converting it to RGB mode. Additionally, it needs to correctly handle the conversion of non-RGB mode images without causing discrepancies in the expected and actual images.

## Corrected Code
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3])  # Use the alpha channel as the mask
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

The corrected code addresses the bug by correctly handling PNG images with RGBA mode, ensuring that the transparency is preserved during the conversion to RGB mode. Additionally, it correctly handles the conversion of non-RGB mode images without causing discrepancies in the expected and actual images.
