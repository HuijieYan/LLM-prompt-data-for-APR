Based on the summarized information, the potential error within the function is in the conditional block that handles transparent RGBA images. The current implementation does not correctly handle the conversion of PNG images with an RGBA mode to RGB mode, resulting in discrepancies between the expected and actual images.

The cause of the bug is that the conditional block specifically checks for the 'PNG' format and 'RGBA' mode but does not properly handle transparent backgrounds when converting the image to RGB mode. This leads to incorrect conversions and discrepancies between the expected and actual images.

To fix the bug, the conditional block should be updated to properly handle images with a transparent background when converting from RGBA to RGB mode. This might involve creating a new RGBA background and pasting the original image onto it to ensure a correct conversion.

Here is the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected code, when the input image has format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA', a new RGB background is created, and the original image is pasted onto it to maintain the transparency. This ensures a correct conversion from RGBA to RGB mode, resolving the discrepancies in the expected and actual images for the given input cases.
