The potential error location within the buggy function is in the conditional block that handles the conversion of PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB.

The bug's cause is that the function does not handle the background correctly when converting PNG images with an RGBA mode to RGB, resulting in discrepancies between the expected and actual images.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the background is applied before converting the image from RGBA to RGB.

Here is the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':  # Check if the image is PNG with RGBA mode
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))  # Create a new RGB background
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)  # Paste the original image onto the background
        image = background  # Use the modified image as the new image
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':  # Check if the image is not in RGB mode
        image = image.convert('RGB')  # Convert the image to RGB mode

    if size:  # If size is specified
        image = image.copy()  # Create a copy of the image
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)  # Resize the image

    buf = BytesIO()  # Create a byte buffer
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')  # Save the image in JPEG format
    return image, buf  # Return the modified image and the buffer
```

The corrected code handles the conversion of PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB by creating a new RGB background, pasting the original image onto the background, and then using the modified image as the new image. This ensures that the background is handled correctly before converting the image.

This corrected code should address the bug and ensure that the function passes the failing test and satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided.
