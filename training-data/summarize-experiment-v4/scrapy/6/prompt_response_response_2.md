The bug seems to be located in the conditional block that handles transparent RGBA images. It incorrectly converts the image to RGB mode without correctly handling the background, resulting in discrepancies between the expected and actual images.

The cause of the bug could be that the function is not properly handling transparent images with RGBA mode when converting them to RGB mode.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that when the input image has format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA', it is correctly converted to RGB mode with the appropriate background handling.

Additionally, we should also address the incorrect handling of image mode not being 'RGB', as well as properly resizing the image when a size is specified.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In this corrected version:
- When the input image has format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA', we create a new RGB background with the same size as the original image, paste the original image onto it, and assign the result back to the image variable. This ensures that the image is correctly converted to RGB mode with the appropriate background handling.
- For other cases, we simply convert the image to RGB mode if it's not already in RGB mode.
- Additionally, we also perform resizing of the image when a size is specified.

With these corrections, the function should now correctly handle transparent RGBA images, convert images to the desired format and size, and return the modified image and buffer as expected.
