Class docstring: This class is an abstract pipeline that implements image thumbnail generation logic.

`def convert_image(self, image, size=None) -> Tuple[Image, BytesIO]`: This function takes an image and an optional size parameter. It checks the format and mode of the image and converts it if necessary. If a size is provided, it resizes the image and saves it as a JPEG. Finally, it returns the modified image and a buffer.

The `Image` class and its methods like `new`, `paste`, `convert`, `thumbnail`, and `save`: These methods are likely used to manipulate the image and perform operations such as creating a new image, pasting images, converting image formats, resizing images, and saving images.

`FilesPipeline` class: This class is likely the parent class that provides additional functionality for working with files in the pipeline.

Other functions within the `ImagesPipeline` class: It's possible that there are other methods within the `ImagesPipeline` class that interact with the `convert_image` function, such as storing the image or handling errors.
