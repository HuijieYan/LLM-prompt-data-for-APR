The bug in the `convert_image` function occurs due to incorrect handling of the image format and mode, specifically when the input image has format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA'. The conditional conversion block does not handle the conversion to RGB mode correctly in this case, resulting in discrepancies between the expected and actual images.

To fix the bug, we need to update the conditional block to handle transparent RGBA images and convert them to RGB mode with the correct background. Additionally, we need to ensure that the function correctly handles the resizing of the image if a size parameter is provided.

Here is the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from typing import Tuple
from PIL import Image
from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None) -> Tuple[Image, BytesIO]:
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a white background for transparent images
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3])  # Use the alpha channel as a mask
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected code, the conditional block for handling transparent RGBA images has been updated to create a white background and paste the image using the alpha channel as a mask. This ensures that transparent images are converted to RGB mode with the correct background. Additionally, the conditional block for handling non-RGB images has been retained, and the resizing logic has been unchanged.

The corrected code addresses the issues with incorrect handling of image format and mode, ensuring that the function returns the expected output for various input cases.
