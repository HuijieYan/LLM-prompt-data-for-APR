## Bug in the Buggy Function

The bug in the `request_httprepr` function appears to be related to the `parsed.hostname` variable being `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when concatenating it with other byte strings and passing it to the `to_bytes` function.

The failing test 'test_request_httprepr_for_non_http_request' in the 'test_utils_request.py' file is encountering a 'TypeError' in the 'to_bytes' function, which is being called from the 'request_httprepr' function in the 'request.py' file. The error occurs at the line where concatenation is performed using 'parsed.hostname', which is causing a 'NoneType' error in the 'to_bytes' function. This suggests that the issue is related to the 'parsed.hostname' variable being 'None', which leads to the 'TypeError' being raised.

## Bug Cause
The bug is likely caused by the 'parsed.hostname' variable being 'None', which results in a 'TypeError' when concatenating it with other byte strings and passing it to the 'to_bytes' function.

## Approach to Fix

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where 'parsed.hostname' is 'None' and provide a default value to prevent the 'TypeError' from occurring.

## The corrected code for the buggy function

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname is not None:  # Check if parsed.hostname is not None
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

By adding a check for `parsed.hostname` to ensure it is not `None`, we prevent the `TypeError` that was occurring. This should resolve the bug and allow the function to handle cases where `parsed.hostname` is `None`.
