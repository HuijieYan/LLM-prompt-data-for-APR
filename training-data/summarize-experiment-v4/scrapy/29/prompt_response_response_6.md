The potential error location within the buggy function is identified as the line where concatenation is performed using 'parsed.hostname'.

The bug's cause is as follows:
(a) The buggy function 'request_httprepr' is constructing a raw HTTP representation of the given request by using various attributes of the request object, such as method, headers, and body.
(b) The failing test 'test_request_httprepr_for_non_http_request' encounters a 'TypeError' in the 'to_bytes' function, which is being called from the 'request_httprepr' function in the 'request.py' file.
(c) The error message indicates a 'TypeError' caused by 'to_bytes' function, and the potential cause is the 'NoneType' error in the 'to_bytes' function raised due to 'parsed.hostname' being 'None' at line 8 in the provided code snippet.
(d) The actual input/output variable values are listed for two different cases.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
The bug can be fixed by handling the case when 'parsed.hostname' is 'None' to prevent the 'TypeError' caused by 'to_bytes'.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname is not None:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
