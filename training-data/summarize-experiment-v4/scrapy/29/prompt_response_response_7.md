The potential error location within the buggy function is identified to be in the line `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"` where the `parsed.hostname` variable is used without checking if it is `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when passed to the `to_bytes` function.

The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
(a) The buggy function `request_httprepr` is designed to return the raw HTTP representation of the given request by constructing a bytes object.
(b) The failing test 'test_request_httprepr_for_non_http_request' in the 'test_utils_request.py' file is encountering a 'TypeError' in the 'to_bytes' function, which is being called from the 'request_httprepr' function in the 'request.py' file. The error occurs at the line where concatenation is performed using 'parsed.hostname', which is causing a 'NoneType' error in the 'to_bytes' function.
(c) The corresponding error message is a 'TypeError' in the `to_bytes` function, caused by passing a `None` value when it expects a string.
(d) The actual input/output variable values are relevant for two cases:
    - Case 1: Input parameters (`request`, `request.method`, `request.headers`, `request.body`) and Output variable (`s`)
    - Case 2: Input parameters (`request`, `request.method`, `request.headers`, `request.body`) and Output variable (`s`)

To fix the bug, it is necessary to check if `parsed.hostname` is `None` before using it in the concatenation. One approach to fix the bug is to modify the code to handle the `None` case by providing a default value for `parsed.hostname`.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname is not None:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, the program should pass the failing test 'test_request_httprepr_for_non_http_request' by handling the `None` case for `parsed.hostname`.
