## Bug's cause:
The bug is caused by the fact that the 'parsed.hostname' variable is None when the request URL does not contain a hostname, which leads to a 'TypeError' being raised in the 'to_bytes' function when trying to concatenate it with other bytes.


## Approach for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where 'parsed.hostname' is None and provide a default hostname value in such cases to avoid the 'TypeError'.


## The corrected code:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    hostname = to_bytes(parsed.hostname) if parsed.hostname else b'default_hostname'
    s += b"Host: " + hostname + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

The bug is fixed by introducing a conditional statement to check if 'parsed.hostname' is None. If it is None, then a default hostname value is used instead to avoid the 'TypeError'.
