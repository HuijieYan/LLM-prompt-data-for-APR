## Bug's Cause

The bug is caused by the 'None' value of 'parsed.hostname', which leads to a 'TypeError' in the 'to_bytes' function when concatenating it with other bytes.


## Approach to Fix the Bug

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where 'parsed.hostname' is 'None' by providing a default value, such as an empty string, to prevent the 'TypeError' from occurring.


## The corrected code for the buggy function

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    hostname = to_bytes(parsed.hostname) if parsed.hostname else b''
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + hostname + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, the 'None' value of 'parsed.hostname' is handled by providing a default value of an empty byte string in the 'hostname' variable. This prevents the 'TypeError' from occurring and ensures that the function works as expected.
