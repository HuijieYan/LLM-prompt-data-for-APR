The potential error location in the buggy function is identified at the line where concatenation is performed using 'parsed.hostname', which is causing a 'NoneType' error in the 'to_bytes' function.

The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
(a) The buggy function 'request_httprepr' is taking a 'request' object as input and attempting to create the raw HTTP representation of the request.
(b) The failing test 'test_request_httprepr_for_non_http_request' encounters a 'TypeError' in the 'to_bytes' function, which is being called from the 'request_httprepr' function.
(c) The corresponding error message is a 'TypeError' raised due to concatenation using 'parsed.hostname', which is 'None'.
(d) The actual input/output variable values are as described in the runtime variables and types summary.

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when 'parsed.hostname' is 'None', and refactor the concatenation in the 'request_httprepr' function to prevent the 'TypeError' from being raised.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname is not None:  # Check if parsed.hostname is not None
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

By adding a check to ensure that 'parsed.hostname' is not 'None' before attempting to concatenate it with 's', the corrected code addresses the bug and ensures that the program passes the failing test.
