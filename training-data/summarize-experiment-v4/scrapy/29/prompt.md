Please fix the buggy function provided below and output a corrected version.


Your output should follow these steps:
1. Analyze the buggy function and its relationship with the test code, corresponding error message, the actual input/output variable information.
2. Identify a potential error location within the buggy function.
3. Elucidate the bug's cause using:
   (a) The buggy function, 
   (b) The failing test, 
   (c) The corresponding error message, 
   (d) The actual input/output variable values

4. Suggest approaches for fixing the bug.
5. Present the corrected code for the buggy function such that it satisfied the following:
   (a) the program passes the failing test




## The source code of the buggy function

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urlunparse
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes, to_native_str
from scrapy.utils.httpobj import urlparse_cached
```

The buggy function is under file: `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/bgp_envs_local/repos/scrapy_29/scrapy/utils/request.py`

Here is the buggy function:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s

```


## Summary of the test cases and error messages

The failing test 'test_request_httprepr_for_non_http_request' in the 'test_utils_request.py' file encounters a 'TypeError' in the 'to_bytes' function, which is being called from the 'request_httprepr' function in the 'request.py' file. The error occurs at the line where concatenation is performed using 'parsed.hostname', which is causing a 'NoneType' error in the 'to_bytes' function. This indicates that the issue is related to the 'parsed.hostname' variable being 'None', which leads to the 'TypeError' being raised.


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The relevant input/output values are:
- Case 1:
   - Input parameters: request (value: `<GET file:///tmp/foo.txt>`, type: `Request`), request.method (value: `'GET'`, type: `str`), request.headers (value: `{}`, type: `Headers`), request.body (value: `b''`, type: `bytes`)
   - Output variables: s (value: `b'GET /tmp/foo.txt HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: \r\n\r\n'`, type: `bytes`)
- Case 2:
   - Input parameters: request (value: `<GET ftp://localhost/tmp/foo.txt>`, type: `Request`), request.method (value: `'GET'`, type: `str`), request.headers (value: `{}`, type: `Headers`), request.body (value: `b''`, type: `bytes`)
   - Output variables: s (value: `b'GET /tmp/foo.txt HTTP/1.1\r\nHost: localhost\r\n\r\n'`, type: `bytes`)

Rational: The output variable "s" appears to be the raw HTTP representation of the given request, and the runtime input/output values of "request" and its attributes seem relevant. These values are likely contributing to the incorrect output of "s".
