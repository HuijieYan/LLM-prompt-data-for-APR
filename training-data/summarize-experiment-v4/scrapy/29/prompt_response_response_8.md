## Bug Cause

The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is caused by the `parsed.hostname` variable being `None`, which leads to a `TypeError` in the `to_bytes` function when concatenating with other bytes.


## Approach to Fix the Bug

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` and provide a default value to avoid the `TypeError` in the `to_bytes` function.


## The corrected code:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    host = to_bytes(parsed.hostname) if parsed.hostname is not None else b""
    s += b"Host: " + host + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
