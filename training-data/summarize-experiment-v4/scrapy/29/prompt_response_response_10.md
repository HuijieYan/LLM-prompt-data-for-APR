## Bug's Cause
The bug is caused by the `parsed.hostname` being `None` when the `request_httprepr` function is being called for a non-HTTP request. This causes a TypeError in the `to_bytes` function when trying to concatenate it with the 'Host' header.

## Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to handle the case when `parsed.hostname` is `None` and provide a default value for 'Host' in the HTTP representation string.

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    else:
        s += b"Host: localhost\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the fixed version, we added a check for `parsed.hostname` to handle the case when it is `None`. If it is `None`, we provide a default value of 'localhost' for the 'Host' header. This will prevent the TypeError from occurring when building the raw HTTP representation.

With this fix, the program should now pass the failing test 'test_request_httprepr_for_non_http_request' in the 'test_utils_request.py' file.
