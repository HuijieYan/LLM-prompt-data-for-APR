## Bug Cause

The bug is likely caused by the 'None' value of 'parsed.hostname' when the URL scheme is not 'http' or 'https'. This 'None' value is leading to a 'TypeError' when trying to concatenate it with other bytes using the 'to_bytes' function.

## Approach to Fix the Bug

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where 'parsed.hostname' is 'None' and provide a default value for the 'Host' header in the raw HTTP representation.

## The corrected code for the buggy function

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    else:
        s += b"Host: localhost\r\n"  # Provide a default value for Host header
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

This corrected code includes a conditional check for 'parsed.hostname' to provide a default host value when 'parsed.hostname' is 'None'. This ensures that the 'TypeError' will not occur, and the function will return the correct raw HTTP representation for different types of requests.
