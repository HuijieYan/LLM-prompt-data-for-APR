The failing test 'test_request_httprepr_for_non_http_request' in the 'test_utils_request.py' file encounters a 'TypeError' in the 'to_bytes' function, which is being called from the 'request_httprepr' function in the 'request.py' file. The error occurs at the line where concatenation is performed using 'parsed.hostname', which is causing a 'NoneType' error in the 'to_bytes' function. This indicates that the issue is related to the 'parsed.hostname' variable being 'None', which leads to the 'TypeError' being raised.
