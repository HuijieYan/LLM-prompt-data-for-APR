## Bug in the Buggy Function

The bug seems to be caused by the swapping and expansion logic in the `nonsingular` function. The problematic condition is `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny`, which leads to a `RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar subtract` error when certain input values are provided.

## Approach to Fix the Bug

To fix the bug, we need to update the swapping and interval expansion logic. Specifically, we should review the conditions that lead to swapping (`vmax < vmin`) and interval expansion (`maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny`) to ensure that the function behaves as expected for all input scenarios.

Additionally, we need to address the scenario mentioned in the function documentation where either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very close to zero.

## Corrected Code

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if vmin == vmax:
        vmin -= expander
        vmax += expander
    elif vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
        vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = min(vmin, vmax), max(vmin, vmax)

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected code revises the swapping and interval expansion logic to ensure that the function behaves as expected for all input scenarios, and handles the mentioned scenario in the function documentation.
