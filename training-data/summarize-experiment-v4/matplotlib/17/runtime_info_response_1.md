Given the runtime information and the expected behavior of the function, there seem to be issues related to the swapping of endpoints and the expansion of intervals. Specifically, in Case 1 and Case 2, there are discrepancies in the values of `vmin` and `vmax` right before the return statement, which indicates potential issues with the swapping logic. Additionally, in Case 4, the function does not handle the scenario where `vmin` and `vmax` are infinite as described in the function documentation. The other cases do not provide relevant information that deviates from the expected function behavior.

It is likely that the bug lies in the swapping and expansion logic in the `nonsingular` function. Therefore, further investigation into the conditions for swapping and interval expansion may help identify and resolve the bug.
