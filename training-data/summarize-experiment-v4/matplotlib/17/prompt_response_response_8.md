The potential error in the `nonsingular` function appears to be in the logic for swapping the endpoints and expanding intervals. The failing test `test_colorbar_int` fails due to a `RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar subtract` error, which seems to be related to the comparison `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` in the `nonsingular` function.

To fix the bug, we need to review and revise the swapping and expansion logic in the `nonsingular` function. Additionally, the function should handle scenarios where `vmin` and `vmax` are infinite as described in the function documentation.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if not increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

The corrected `nonsingular` function applies the correct swapping logic based on the `increasing` parameter and handles the scenario where `vmin` and `vmax` are infinite as described in the function documentation. This should resolve the issues identified in the failing test cases and ensure that the function behaves as expected in all scenarios.
