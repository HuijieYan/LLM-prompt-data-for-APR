The buggy function "nonsingular" is expected to modify the input endpoints, as needed, to avoid singularities, based on the given parameters. Each case presents different input parameter values and types, along with the expected values and types of relevant variables right before the function's return.

Case 1: Given the input parameters, the expected value and type of the variable "maxabsvalue" is 1, and the variable "swapped" is expected to have a value of "False".

Case 2: Given the input parameters, the expected value and type of the variable "maxabsvalue" is 1.5, and the variable "swapped" is expected to have a value of "False".

Case 3: Given the input parameters, the expected values and types of the variables "vmin" and "vmax" are -0.5 and 0.5 respectively, "maxabsvalue" is expected to have a value of 0.5, and the variable "swapped" is expected to have a value of "True".

Case 4: Given the input parameters, the expected values and types of the variables "vmin" and "vmax" are -0.05 and 0.05 respectively.

These are the expected values and types of variables during the failing test executions, and a corrected function must satisfy all of these cases to correctly avoid singularities.
