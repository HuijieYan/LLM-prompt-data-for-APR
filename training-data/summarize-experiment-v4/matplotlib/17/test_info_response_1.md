When the program runs the failing test `test_colorbar_int`, the `nonsingular` function is called. The test fails when the `vmin` and `vmax` values are (- 20,000, 20,000) and (-32,768, 0) respectively, causing a `RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar subtract` error. It seems that the problematic stack frame is the line `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` in the `nonsingular` function.
