The potential bug in the `nonsingular` function is most likely related to the swapping and expansion logic, leading to incorrect handling of endpoint values and interval expansions. Specifically, the conditions for swapping and interval expansion need to be further investigated to identify and resolve the bug.

To resolve the bug, the following steps can be taken:
1. Review the conditions for swapping and interval expansion to ensure they correctly handle all edge cases and avoid singularities.
2. Update the swapping and expansion logic in the `nonsingular` function to address the issues identified in the failing test cases.
3. Test the modified function with the failing test case to verify that it passes without encountering the `RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar subtract` error.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    if increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    interval = vmax - vmin
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))

    if interval < tiny * maxabsvalue:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if not increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmax, vmin = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

The updated function handles the swapping and expansion conditions in a more robust manner, addressing the issues identified in the failing test cases. The modified function should now pass the failing test `test_colorbar_int` without encountering the `RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar subtract` error.
