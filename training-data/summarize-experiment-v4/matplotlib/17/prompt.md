## The source code of the buggy function

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
import numpy as np
```

The buggy function is under file: `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/bgp_envs_local/repos/matplotlib_17/lib/matplotlib/transforms.py`

Here is the buggy function:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax

```


## Summary of the test cases and error messages

When the program runs the failing test `test_colorbar_int`, the `nonsingular` function is called. The test fails when the `vmin` and `vmax` values are (- 20,000, 20,000) and (-32,768, 0) respectively, causing a `RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar subtract` error. It seems that the problematic stack frame is the line `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` in the `nonsingular` function.


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

Given the runtime information and the expected behavior of the function, there seem to be issues related to the swapping of endpoints and the expansion of intervals. Specifically, in Case 1 and Case 2, there are discrepancies in the values of `vmin` and `vmax` right before the return statement, which indicates potential issues with the swapping logic. Additionally, in Case 4, the function does not handle the scenario where `vmin` and `vmax` are infinite as described in the function documentation. The other cases do not provide relevant information that deviates from the expected function behavior.

It is likely that the bug lies in the swapping and expansion logic in the `nonsingular` function. Therefore, further investigation into the conditions for swapping and interval expansion may help identify and resolve the bug.


## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

The buggy function "nonsingular" is expected to modify the input endpoints, as needed, to avoid singularities, based on the given parameters. Each case presents different input parameter values and types, along with the expected values and types of relevant variables right before the function's return.

Case 1: Given the input parameters, the expected value and type of the variable "maxabsvalue" is 1, and the variable "swapped" is expected to have a value of "False".

Case 2: Given the input parameters, the expected value and type of the variable "maxabsvalue" is 1.5, and the variable "swapped" is expected to have a value of "False".

Case 3: Given the input parameters, the expected values and types of the variables "vmin" and "vmax" are -0.5 and 0.5 respectively, "maxabsvalue" is expected to have a value of 0.5, and the variable "swapped" is expected to have a value of "True".

Case 4: Given the input parameters, the expected values and types of the variables "vmin" and "vmax" are -0.05 and 0.05 respectively.

These are the expected values and types of variables during the failing test executions, and a corrected function must satisfy all of these cases to correctly avoid singularities.
