## Bug in the Buggy Function

The buggy function "nonsingular" is intended to modify the input endpoints to avoid singularities and return the modified endpoints. However, the function has a bug, most likely related to the swapping and expansion logic in the function.

When the test "test_colorbar_int" is executed, the bug causes the function to return the wrong values for `vmin` and `vmax`, resulting in a `RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar subtract` error. This is likely due to issues with the swapping and interval expansion conditions in the function.

#### Approaches for Fixing the Bug
1. Ensure that the swapping logic for `vmin` and `vmax` is correctly implemented to handle all cases including edge cases.
2. Revise the interval expansion conditions to avoid overflow errors and ensure proper handling of infinite values for `vmin` and `vmax`.

Based on the bug description and the expected behavior of the function, the corrected code for the buggy function "nonsingular" is provided below:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if increasing:
        if vmax < vmin:
            vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
            swapped = True
    else:
        if vmax > vmin:
            vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
            swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected code addresses the issues with swapping and interval expansion logic. It ensures that the function handles all cases correctly and avoids singularities as intended.
