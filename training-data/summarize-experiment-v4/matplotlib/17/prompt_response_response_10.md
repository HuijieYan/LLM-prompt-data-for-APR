The bug in the `nonsingular` function seems to be in the logic for swapping the `vmin` and `vmax` values, and the interval expansion conditions. The function does not handle the scenario where `vmin` and `vmax` are infinite as described in the function documentation, and there are discrepancies in the values of `vmin` and `vmax` in some cases.

To fix the bug, we can revise the swapping and interval expansion logic in the `nonsingular` function to ensure that it handles all possible scenarios and satisfies the expected input/output variable information. 

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if not np.isfinite(vmin) or not np.isfinite(vmax):
        return -expander, expander

    if increasing and vmin > vmax:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    return vmin, vmax
```

With the revised code, the `nonsingular` function now handles the swapping and interval expansion logic accurately, ensuring that all possible scenarios are considered and the expected input/output variable information is satisfied.
