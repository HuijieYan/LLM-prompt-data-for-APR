Based on the analysis provided, it appears that the issue with the `_recache` function lies in the setting of the `_filled` attribute to `True`, which contradicts the expected behavior when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'. Additionally, the way the `_marker_function` method is being called is likely contributing to the issue. 

To fix this bug, the `_recache` function needs to be updated to correctly handle the `fillstyle` parameter and appropriately call the `_marker_function` method. 

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_recache` function to set the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `fillstyle`, the bug should be resolved. This fix ensures that if the `fillstyle` is set to 'none', the marker will be hollow, as expected.

This fix also addresses the issue reported on GitHub, where users were experiencing unexpected behavior when setting the `fillstyle` to 'none' for markers.

With this corrected code, the failing test related to the `is_filled` method for the `MarkerStyle` object should pass, and the behavior observed in the GitHub issue should be resolved.
