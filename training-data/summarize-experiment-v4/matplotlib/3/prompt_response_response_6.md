Potential error location: The issue seems to be occurring in the `_recache` function where the `self._filled` attribute is being set to True regardless of the `fillstyle` parameter.

Bug's cause:
(a) The `_recache` function resets several attributes, including setting `_filled` to `True`, and then calls the `_marker_function`.
(b) The failing test `test_marker_fillstyle` is related to the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` object, suggesting that the bug is likely in the `_recache` function, specifically in how it deals with the `fillstyle` parameter.
(c) The corresponding error message indicates that even when `fillstyle` is set to 'none', the markers are not hollow as expected.
(d) Based on the input parameter and variables, the `fillstyle` parameter is being updated to 'none', but the `_filled` variable is still being set to True before the return, which contradicts the expected behavior.
(e) The actual input/output variable values show that `fillstyle` is being set to 'none' but `_filled` is being set to True.
(f) The expected behavior is that when `fillstyle` is set to 'none', the markers should be hollow.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the `_recache` function to consider the `fillstyle` parameter and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly.
2. Ensure that the `_marker_function` aligns with the expected behavior when `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.
3. Test the behavior of the `MarkerStyle` with the `fillstyle` parameter set to 'none' in various scenarios to confirm correct functioning.

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```
In the corrected version, the `_filled` variable is set based on the value of the `fillstyle` parameter. If the `fillstyle` is not 'none', then `_filled` will be `True`, indicating a filled marker. If the `fillstyle` is 'none', then the `_filled` will be `False`, resulting in a hollow marker. This update aligns the behavior of the `_recache` function with the expected behavior when `fillstyle` is set to 'none', resolving the issue reported in GitHub.
