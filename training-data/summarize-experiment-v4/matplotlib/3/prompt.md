## The source code of the buggy function

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
from .transforms import IdentityTransform, Affine2D
```

The buggy function is under file: `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/bgp_envs_local/repos/matplotlib_3/lib/matplotlib/markers.py`

Here is the buggy function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()

```


## Summary of Related Functions

Class docstring: This class likely deals with defining marker styles for data visualization. 

`def _recache(self)`: This function appears to reset several attributes and then call another function `_marker_function`. The issue may lie in the implementation of `_marker_function` or in the values being set in this function.

`_marker_function()`: The exact details of this function are not provided, but it is being called at the end of `_recache` and is likely crucial to the correct functioning of the `MarkerStyle` class.

Understanding the interactions and dependencies of these functions within the `MarkerStyle` class will be crucial in pinpointing the cause of the failure in `_recache`.


## Summary of the test cases and error messages

The failing test is related to the `test_marker_fillstyle` function in the test_marker.py test file. The error is related to the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` object, which in turn calls the `_marker_function` method within the `_recache` function. This suggests that the bug is likely to be in the `_recache` function, particularly in how it calls the `_marker_function` method, which is causing the `is_filled` assertion to fail.


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The relevant input/output values are:
- Input parameters: self._fillstyle (value: 'none', type: str)

- Variables right before the return:
  - self._path (value: Path(array([[ 0.        , -1.        ] ... [ 1,  4,  4,  4,  4,  4,  4,  4,  4,  4,  4,  4,  4,  4,  4,  4,  4,
        4,  4,  4,  4,  4,  4,  4,  4, 79], dtype=uint8)), type: Path)
  - self._snap_threshold (value: inf, type: float)
  - self._joinstyle (value: 'round', type: str)
  - self._capstyle (value: 'butt', type: str)
  - self._filled (value: False, type: bool)

Rational: The input parameter `self._fillstyle` is being updated to 'none' and the `_filled` variable is being set to False right before the return, which may be relevant to the bug.


## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

The buggy function _recache(self) is expected to reset certain class attributes and call the marker function if it is not None. However, there is an issue with setting the self._path attribute, as it is assigned an incorrect value causing a failure in the expected output. The expected output consists of several attributes with their corresponding expected values and types right before the buggy function's return.


## A GitHub issue for this bug

The issue's title:
```text
The markers are not hollow when I use ax.scatter() and set markers.MarkerStyle()'s fillstyle to 'none'. My usage is wrong?
```

The issue's detailed description:
```text
I want to set markers hollow. So I make a costomed markers.MarkerStyle and set the paramter fillstyle='none'. But I don't get what I want.

Code for reproduction

from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
from matplotlib import markers
import numpy as np
xy = np.random.rand(10, 2)
fig, ax = plt.subplots()
style = markers.MarkerStyle(marker='o', fillstyle='none')
ax.scatter(xy[:, 0], xy[:, 1], marker=style)
plt.show()
```
