The failing test is related to the `test_marker_fillstyle` function in the test_marker.py test file. The error is related to the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` object, which in turn calls the `_marker_function` method within the `_recache` function. This suggests that the bug is likely to be in the `_recache` function, particularly in how it calls the `_marker_function` method, which is causing the `is_filled` assertion to fail.
