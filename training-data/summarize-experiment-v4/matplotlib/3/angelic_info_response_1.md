The buggy function _recache(self) is expected to reset certain class attributes and call the marker function if it is not None. However, there is an issue with setting the self._path attribute, as it is assigned an incorrect value causing a failure in the expected output. The expected output consists of several attributes with their corresponding expected values and types right before the buggy function's return.
