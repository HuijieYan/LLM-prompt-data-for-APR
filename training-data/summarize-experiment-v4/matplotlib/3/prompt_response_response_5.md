The bug in the _recache function appears to be related to the incorrect assignment of the self._filled class attribute. When the fillstyle parameter is set to 'none', the _filled attribute is being set to True, which is causing the markers to not be hollow as per the user's expectations. This issue has been reported on GitHub as well.

To fix this bug, the _filled attribute should be set to False when the fillstyle is 'none' to ensure that markers are hollow when the fillstyle is explicitly set to 'none'.

Here's the corrected code for the _recache function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'

    if self._fillstyle == 'none':  # Check fillstyle before setting _filled
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True

    self._marker_function()
```

With this modification, the self._filled attribute is correctly set based on the fillstyle parameter, ensuring that markers are hollow when fillstyle is set to 'none'.

This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that markers are displayed as expected when using ax.scatter() and setting MarkerStyle's fillstyle to 'none'.
