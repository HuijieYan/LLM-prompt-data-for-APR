Potential Error Location in the Buggy Function:
The potential error location in the buggy function `_recache` may be in the way the `_marker_function` is being called. There is also an issue with setting the `self._path` attribute, as its value is being assigned incorrectly.

Bug's Cause:
(a) The `_recache` function resets several attributes and then calls the `_marker_function`.
(b) The failing test is related to the `test_marker_fillstyle` function in the test_marker.py test file, which suggests that the bug is likely in the `_recache` function, particularly in how it calls the `_marker_function` method.
(c) The error is due to the markers not being hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `markers.MarkerStyle()`'s fillstyle to 'none'.
(d) The failing test produces an assertion error for `is_filled`, indicating that the markers are not being correctly set to hollow.
(e) Actual input/output variable values include `self._fillstyle` (value: 'none', type: str) and several other class attributes with their corresponding values.
(f) Expected input/output variable values are not being met as the markers are not being rendered as hollow, resulting in the failing test and assertion error.
(g) The GitHub issue describes the user's attempt to set markers as hollow but not achieving the expected result.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the issue with setting the `self._path` attribute needs to be addressed, and the `_marker_function` method should be reviewed to ensure it correctly sets the markers to be hollow when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.

Corrected Code:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = None  # Reset the path attribute
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = False  # Ensure markers are hollow when fillstyle is 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```
