Based on the information provided, it appears that the issue in the `_recache` function of the `MarkerStyle` class is related to the incorrect update of the `self._filled` attribute causing markers to not appear as hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'. This issue has been reported on GitHub with a code example that reproduces the problem.

To fix this issue, the `_recache` function should properly handle the `fillstyle` attribute and update the `self._filled` variable accordingly. Additionally, the `_marker_function` method should be reviewed to ensure that it is correctly setting the filled property of the markers.

Here is the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version of the function, the `_filled` attribute is updated based on the `fillstyle` value before the `_marker_function` is called. This will ensure that markers are properly displayed as hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none', resolving the issue reported on GitHub.

By making this change, the failing test related to the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` object should pass, and the issue reported on GitHub should be resolved.
