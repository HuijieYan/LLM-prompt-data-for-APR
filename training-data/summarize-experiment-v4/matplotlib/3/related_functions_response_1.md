Class docstring: This class likely deals with defining marker styles for data visualization. 

`def _recache(self)`: This function appears to reset several attributes and then call another function `_marker_function`. The issue may lie in the implementation of `_marker_function` or in the values being set in this function.

`_marker_function()`: The exact details of this function are not provided, but it is being called at the end of `_recache` and is likely crucial to the correct functioning of the `MarkerStyle` class.

Understanding the interactions and dependencies of these functions within the `MarkerStyle` class will be crucial in pinpointing the cause of the failure in `_recache`.
