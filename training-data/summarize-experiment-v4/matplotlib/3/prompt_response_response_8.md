The potential error in the buggy function `_recache` appears to be with setting the `_filled` attribute to `True`, which contradicts the intended use of setting the `fillstyle` to 'none' to create hollow markers.

The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
(a) The _filled attribute is set to True, which contradicts the purpose of setting the fillstyle to 'none'. This is likely to be the source of the bug.
(b) The MarkerStyle class uses these attributes to define marker styles for visualization.
(c) The failing test is related to the is_filled method, which suggests that the issue is with the _filled attribute being set to True despite the fillstyle being 'none'.
(d) The error message indicates a failure related to the marker fillstyle, indicating that the marker is not rendered as hollow as expected.
(e) The actual input parameters include the fillstyle being updated to 'none' and the _filled attribute being set to False right before the return.
(f) The expected output should include resetting the attributes and setting the _filled attribute to False when the fillstyle is 'none'.
(g) The GitHub issue describes a similar problem with markers not being rendered as hollow when using ax.scatter() and setting the fillstyle to 'none'.

To fix the bug, the _filled attribute should be set to False when the fillstyle is 'none' to ensure that the markers are rendered as hollow.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':  # Check if fillstyle is 'none'
        self._filled = False  # Set _filled to False for hollow markers
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, when the fillstyle is set to 'none', the markers will be rendered as hollow, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
