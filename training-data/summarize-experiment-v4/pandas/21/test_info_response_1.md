The failing test titled `test_getitem_no_matches` in the file `test_getitem.py` raises a `KeyError` exception because the `ser` function is not working as expected. Candidates for the relevant stack frame for this failure include line number 91 of the test file, contained in the `test_getitem_no_matches` function. The error arises from the `_get_with` function located in the pandas library, and possibly because it fails to handle instances of a list, numpy array, index, and a pandas series, or due to a type conversion.
