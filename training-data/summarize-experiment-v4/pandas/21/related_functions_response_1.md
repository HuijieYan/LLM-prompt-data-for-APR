`def _slice(self, slobj: slice, axis: int=0) -> 'Series'`:  This function is likely used to slice a `Series` object based on the given slice object and axis.

`def _get_values_tuple(self, key)`: This function probably retrieves values based on the provided key, although the specifics of how this happens are not relevant.

`reindex(self, index=None, **kwargs)`: This function likely reindexes the `Series`, but the inner workings are not our concern.

Class docstring: The `Series` class represents a one-dimensional array with axis labels and supports various operations.

`def _get_with(self, key)`: The buggy function implements logic for different types of keys and their corresponding actions, likely to retrieve specific values from the `Series`. The current issue might involve incorrect handling of the key types or improper function calls within the different condition blocks. Understanding the roles and interactions of the related functions and methods can provide a clearer view of how the problematic function fits within the larger codebase.
