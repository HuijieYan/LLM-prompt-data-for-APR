Based on the analysis provided, it seems that the bug in the `_get_with` function lies in the inconsistent treatment of different types of indexers, leading to inconsistencies in the `key_type` determination and incorrect handling of various key types.

To resolve this issue, the function `_get_with` should be modified to handle different types of indexers consistently and accurately determine the `key_type` based on the input `key`. This may involve adjusting the conditional blocks and the underlying logic for determining the `key_type` based on the type of `key` being passed.

Here is a corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        # or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # Handle specific types of indexers consistently
    elif is_iterator(key):
        key = list(key)

    if is_bool(key):
        key = ensure_platform_int(key)

    if is_dict_like(key):
        key = list(key)
    
    # Determine key type based on the type of key being passed
    if is_list_like(key):
        key_type = 'string'
    elif is_integer(key):
        key_type = 'integer'
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # Return result based on determined key type
    if key_type == "integer":
        # We need to decide whether to treat this as a positional indexer
        # (i.e. self.iloc) or label-based (i.e. self.loc)
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, the function now explicitly handles different types of indexers such as iterators, boolean, and dictionary-like objects to ensure consistent treatment. Additionally, there is a clear determination of the `key_type` based on the type of the `key` being passed, and the appropriate actions are taken based on the determined `key_type`.

This corrected version should address the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers and improve the accuracy of determining the `key_type` in the `_get_with` function.
