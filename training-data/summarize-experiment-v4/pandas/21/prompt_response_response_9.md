The potential error in the `_get_with` function is likely due to inconsistent handling of different types of indexers, leading to incorrect determination of the key_type. The issue arises from the `if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)): key = list(key)` block, where the key is converted to a list regardless of its original type, resulting in improper type determination and subsequent processing.

A potential approach to fixing the bug is to modify the code to correctly identify the type of key being passed and handle it appropriately. We can update the logic to determine the key_type based on the type of key provided and act accordingly, without unnecessary type conversions that may lead to incorrect results.

Here is the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        if is_scalar(key):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This modified code introduces conditional checks for different types of keys and handles them accordingly without unnecessary type conversions. The logic now accurately determines the key_type based on the type of key being passed, resulting in correct processing and resolution of the issue raised in the GitHub discussion.
