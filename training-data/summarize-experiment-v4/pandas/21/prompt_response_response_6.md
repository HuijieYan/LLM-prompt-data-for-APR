Based on the analysis, the potential error location within the buggy function is in the conditional blocks that handle different types of keys. 

The cause of the bug is related to the inconsistent handling of different key types, leading to incorrect determination of the key_type. This inconsistency is reflected in the failing test case `test_getitem_no_matches` and is also reported as a GitHub issue titled "API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]".

To fix the bug, we need to ensure consistent handling of different key types and their corresponding actions within the `_get_with` function.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determin if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        return self.loc[key]

    # Check for different key types and handle them accordingly
    if hasattr(key, 'dtype'):
        if key.dtype == np.object:
            key_type = 'string'
        elif key.dtype == np.int64:
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]
    else:
        # If none of the conditions match, reindex the Series
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected code, we have added a check for `dtype` attribute in the key, specifically checking for `np.object` and `np.int64` to handle different key types. This would ensure consistent handling of different key types and should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub repository.
