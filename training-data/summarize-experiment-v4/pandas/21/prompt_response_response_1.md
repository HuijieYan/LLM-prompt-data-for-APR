The bug in the `_get_with` function seems to stem from inconsistent handling of different types of key values, resulting in incorrect determination of the key type. This inconsistency may lead to unexpected behavior when attempting to retrieve values from the `Series` object.

To fix this bug:
1. We need to standardize the treatment of different types of key parameters to ensure that the correct key type is determined consistently.
2. We should also ensure that the function returns the expected key type based on the input key parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
    else:
        raise ValueError("Invalid key type")

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this correction, we have removed the check for the key being an Index, as the key type should be determined based on the input itself rather than the specific type of object. Instead, we directly infer the key type using `lib.infer_dtype` for the key types that are considered array-like.

This corrected version ensures that the `_get_with` function consistently handles different types of keys and correctly determines the key type, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub report and resolving the bug.
