## Bug Cause Analysis

The bug is likely caused by inconsistent handling of different types of indexers in the `_get_with` function. The function is meant to correctly identify the type of key being passed and return the appropriate key_type.

1. The failing test case `test_getitem_no_matches` in the file `test_getitem.py` raises a `KeyError` exception.
2. The `_get_with` function in the pandas library is likely failing to handle instances of a list, numpy array, index, and a pandas series correctly, or due to a type conversion.
3. The input parameters for the key and the self.index and self (Series) are consistent across cases, but the output key_type varies, indicating a possible inconsistency in identifying the key_type based on the type of key being passed.

## Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_get_with` function correctly identifies the type of key being passed and returns the appropriate key_type. 

We can achieve this by:
1. Ensuring that the function consistently handles different types of indexers, such as list, numpy array, index, and pandas series, and returns the correct key_type for each type of key.
2. Evaluating the logic for handling different types of key input and ensuring that the correct actions are taken for each type.

## Corrected Code

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = [key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, Series, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected code:
- We have added a check for the `is_list_like(key)` condition to handle non-list-like keys correctly.
- We have ensured that the function consistently handles different types of indexers and returns the correct key_type for each type of key.
- We have evaluated the logic for handling different types of key input and ensured that the correct actions are taken for each type.

This corrected code aims to resolve the issue described in the GitHub bug report and correctly handle different types of key input in the `_get_with` function.
