The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function appears to be related to the handling of different data types when performing column-wise operations. The failing test case involves a DataFrame and a Series of timedelta64 values, and it seems that the function fails to handle this combination properly.

One potential error location within the function is the conditional block for handling various types of `right` input. The sequence of nested conditional blocks could be causing the incorrect handling of the data types, leading to the error.

To fix the bug, the conditional blocks for handling different types of `right` input should be reviewed and modified as needed to ensure proper handling of the timedelta64 values.

Here is the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right[x.name]))
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    return new_data
```

In this corrected code, the conditional blocks for handling different types of `right` input have been simplified and modified to use the `apply` function to perform the column-wise operations based on the type of `right` input.

This should address the bug and ensure that the `dispatch_to_series` function properly handles the DataFrame and Series of timedelta64 values.
