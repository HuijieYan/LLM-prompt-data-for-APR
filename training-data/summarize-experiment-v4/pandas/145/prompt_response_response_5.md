The potential error location within the buggy function is likely in the handling of the `right` input variable, specifically when it is a Series containing 'NaT' values of type 'timedelta64[ns]'. The function should handle this input type by performing the specified operation column-wise but does not do so effectively, leading to the error.

The bug's cause is likely due to an incorrect handling of the data types and conversion of the 'right' input variable within the function. The failure to properly process the 'right' input leads to errors in the subsequent function calls, causing the final return values to be of unexpected types.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly handle the 'right' input variable and perform the column-wise operations as intended, ensuring the final return values match the expected types.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function 'dispatch_to_series':

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    new_data = None
    if np.isscalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError('Unsupported operand type')

    return new_data
```

In the corrected code:
- We use `np.isscalar` to check for scalar values.
- We use the `apply` method to perform element-wise operations column-wise.
- We handle the different cases of `right` input types and perform the operations as expected.
- We also remove the unnecessary import statement within the function.

With these changes, the function should handle the 'right' input variable correctly and produce the expected output for the failing test case.
