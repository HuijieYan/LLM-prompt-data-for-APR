## Bug's Cause

The bug seems to be caused by the incorrect handling of the input types within the `dispatch_to_series` function. It appears that the function does not properly handle the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series with timedelta64 values, leading to unsupported operand types. This is likely due to a mismatch in the expected input types.

## Approach for Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series with timedelta64 values. This may involve checking the types of the input values, implementing appropriate error handling, and ensuring that the operation is performed correctly.

## The Corrected Code

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    if isinstance(right, (int, float)) or isinstance(right, np.ndarray):
        return left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right), axis=0)
    elif isinstance(right, pd.Series):
        if right.dtype == 'timedelta64[ns]':
            return left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right), axis=0)
        else:
            raise ValueError("Unsupported type for 'right'")
    else:
        raise ValueError("Unsupported type for 'right'")
```

In the corrected code:
- We check the type of the `right` input to handle different scenarios using `isinstance`.
- For scalar or ndarray types, we apply the function `func` to each column of the DataFrame.
- For a Series with timedelta64 values, we also apply the function `func` to each column of the DataFrame.
- We raise ValueErrors for unsupported types of the `right` input.

This corrected code should address the bug and ensure that the function behaves as expected when handling different types of inputs.
