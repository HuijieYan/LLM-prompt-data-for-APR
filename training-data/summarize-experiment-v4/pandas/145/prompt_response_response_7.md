The bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be related to handling the different data types passed to the function. The error occurs when attempting to perform a multiplication operation with incompatible types, specifically involving a Series of timedelta values and a DataFrame.

To fix this bug, the function needs to ensure that it correctly handles the different types of inputs, specifically when handling the multiplication operation with the Series of timedelta values.

Here's the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
  
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right))
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col, idx: func(col, right[idx]), axis=0, args=(right.index,))
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col, idx: func(col, right[idx]), axis=0, args=(right.index,))
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right))
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    return new_data
```

In the corrected code:
- The `column_op` functions have been replaced with lambda functions using the `apply` method, which allows for more natural handling of the different input types and axis values.
- The conditional branches for handling different types of `right` input have been refined to ensure the appropriate operation is performed.

With these corrections, the function should now correctly handle different input types and axis values, producing the expected DataFrame output.
