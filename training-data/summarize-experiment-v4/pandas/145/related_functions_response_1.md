Class docstring: This `dispatch_to_series` function is used to evaluate the frame operation `func(left, right)` by dispatching the operation to the Series implementation.

`lib.item_from_zerodim(right)`: Presumably, this function is used to handle a scalar or non-unique column cases.

`lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0`: This conditional block likely handles the case when the `right` input is a scalar value.

`column_op(a, b)`: This inner function seems to be responsible for performing the column-wise operation based on the type of `right` input, and it is utilized to construct a new DataFrame using the `func` operation.

`expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)`: Finally, this function is used to evaluate the `column_op` function and generate the new DataFrame based on the operation.

These related functions are crucial to understand the interaction and role of the `dispatch_to_series` function within the larger codebase, and they should provide insight into why the function may be failing.
