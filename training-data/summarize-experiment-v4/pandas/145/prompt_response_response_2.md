Potential bug location: The potential bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to be related to the handling of different input types, specifically when dealing with the `right` input, which can be a scalar, DataFrame, or Series.

Bug's cause:
The bug may be caused by incorrect handling of the input types and their corresponding operations. This may result in unexpected data type conversions and unsupported operand types, leading to the error encountered in the failing test case.

Approach for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the function properly handles the different input types for the `right` parameter.
2. Verify that the column-wise operations are performed correctly based on the input types.
3. Check for any inconsistencies in data type conversions and ensure compatibility for the operations being performed.

Here's the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame or Series
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)  # Handle scalar or non-unique column cases
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right), axis=0)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame) and right._indexed_same(left):
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x, y: func(x, y), right)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and len(right) == len(left.columns):
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x, y: func(x, y), right)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and len(right) == len(left):
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x, y: func(x, y), right)
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError("Invalid input type for 'right'")

    return new_data
```

In the corrected code:
1. The `right` input is handled using conditional statements that cover scalar, DataFrame, and Series cases.
2. The column-wise operations are performed using the DataFrame's `apply` function with lambda functions to apply the `func` operation.
3. Consistency in data type conversions and compatibility for operations are ensured based on the input types.
