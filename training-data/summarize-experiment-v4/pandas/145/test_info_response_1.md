The error occurs when calling the `dispatch_to_series` function from the `pandas/core/ops/__init__.py` file. The error is caused by using the multiplication operator with incompatible operand types 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType', as indicated by the error message from `pandas/core/ops/array_ops.py`. The failing test calls the function with a DataFrame and a Series of timedelta64 values. The operation then goes through a series of nested function calls that handle different operand types. It eventually leads to the error in the `masked_arith_op` function, where the unsupported operand type is encountered. This sequence of function calls should be reviewed to understand the data types being handled and identify the cause of the error.
