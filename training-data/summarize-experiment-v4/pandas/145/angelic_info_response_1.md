The buggy function 'dispatch_to_series' is designed to evaluate a frame operation by dispatching to the Series implementation. However, there seems to be a bug in the function that needs to be addressed.

The expected input and output values for the failing test execution are as follows:

### Expected case 1
#### The values and types of buggy function's parameters
- right: A Series with values 'NaT' and type 'timedelta64[ns]'
- func: Multiplication function
- left: A DataFrame with values [0, 1] and [3, 4]
- axis: 'columns'
- right.index: A RangeIndex
- left.columns: A RangeIndex
- left.index: A RangeIndex

#### Expected values and types of variables right before the buggy function's return
- a: A DataFrame with values [0, 1] and [3, 4]
- b: A Series with values 'NaT' and type 'timedelta64[ns]'
- a.columns: A RangeIndex
- expressions: Module 'pandas.core.computation.expressions'

To summarize, the buggy function is designed to handle various input types and evaluate column-by-column operations. However, based on the failing test case provided, the function does not produce the expected output. The bug needs to be addressed to ensure the function works as intended.
