## Bug Location

The bug is likely located within the nested `if-elif-else` conditional blocks that handle different types of `right` inputs. It seems that the conversion from a Series to an ndarray within the `column_op` functions might be causing the issue when operating on the values. This conversion may not be handled correctly for timedelta64 values, leading to the error encountered in the failing test case.

## Bug's Cause

The cause of the bug can be attributed to the mishandling of the Series and ndarray conversion for timedelta64 values within the `column_op` function. This mishandling likely results in an unsupported data type during the operation, leading to the error.

## Approaches for Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, the conversion from a Series to an ndarray within the `column_op` function needs to be handled properly, especially for timedelta64 values. Additionally, the operations on these values need to be checked to ensure they are compatible with the specific data type. 

## Corrected Code

Here is the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """

    new_data = None

    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right.loc[:, x.name]))

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right))

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda x: func(x, right.loc[x.name]))

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    return new_data
```

In the corrected code, the `column_op` functions are replaced with the application of the `func` operation to the DataFrame columns based on the specific conditions. This ensures that the correct operation is applied to the values without the need for explicit conversion to ndarrays. Additionally, the logic for handling different types of `right` inputs has been simplified to address the bug.
