`astype_nansafe`: This function is used to cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. It has parameters like `arr` (ndarray), `dtype` (np.dtype), `copy` (bool), and `skipna` (bool), and it can raise a ValueError under certain conditions.

`astype_nansafe` calls the function `is_extension_array_dtype` to dispatch on extension dtype if needed. It also contains a series of conditional statements to handle different data types such as string, datetime64, timedelta64, floating, and object dtype.

Additionally, it makes use of the functions `pandas_dtype`, `lib.astype_str`, `tslibs.ints_to_pydatetime`, `tslibs.ints_to_pytimedelta`, `lib.astype_intsafe`, `to_datetime`, `to_timedelta`, and `arr.astype` to perform various operations based on the data type of the elements and the dtype parameter.

Overall, `astype_nansafe` is an important function that ensures safe casting of array elements to the specified dtype, handling various edge cases and data types.
