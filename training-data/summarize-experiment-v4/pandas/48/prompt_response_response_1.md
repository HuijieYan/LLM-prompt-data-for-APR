To fix the bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, let's focus on the part of the code where it performs the cast back to the original dtype and handles Extension Blocks. It seems like the bug might be related to the handling of types during the cast and the check for Extension Blocks.

Here is a potential approach to fix the bug:
- Check the conditions for how Extension Blocks are handled and ensure that the cast operation is performed correctly for these cases.
- Verify the logic for the cast back to the original dtype and handling of Extension Blocks to ensure it aligns with the expected behavior.

The corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is provided below:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # existing code remains same...
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        # existing code for preceding logic...

        if result is not no_result:
            # Updated logic to handle Extension Blocks
            if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                if result.ndim == 1 or result.shape[0] == 1:
                    try:
                        # Cast back if feasible for Extension Blocks
                        if len(result.shape) == 1:
                            result = type(block.values)._from_sequence(
                                result, dtype=block.values.dtype
                            )
                        else:
                            result = type(block.values)._from_sequence(
                                result.ravel(), dtype=block.values.dtype
                            )
                    except ValueError:
                        # If unable to cast, reshape the result
                        if len(result.shape) == 1:
                            result = result.reshape(1, -1)
                else:
                    # Handle the case where Extension Blocks do not meet the expected dimensions
                    split_items.append(locs)
                    split_frames.append(result)
                    continue
            else:
                # Original logic for non-Extension Blocks
                result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        # existing code...
        
    # existing code...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

With the updated code, the function should now successfully handle the cast back to the original dtype, including correct handling for Extension Blocks. This should address the TypeError issue observed in the failing test cases and resolve the GitHub issue related to calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype resulting in a TypeError.
