The relevant input/output values are:
- Input parameters: how (value: 'var', type: str), self.obj (DataFrame)
- Output: result (value: array([[0.5, 0.5, 0.5]]), type: ndarray)

Rationale: The function logic for the computation of the 'var' seems to be incorrect as the computed result does not match the expected variance for the given input data. Further analysis is needed to identify the exact source of the bug.
