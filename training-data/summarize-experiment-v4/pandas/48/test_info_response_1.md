The failing test cases shows that the stack trace points to the _from_sequence method in the buggy function. This method uses the coerce_to_array method which calls safe_cast. Then the TypeError is raised within the safe_cast method. The error message describes the failure to cast array from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64'). All failing test cases raise this same TypeError when the safe_cast method is invoked. This can indicate that the bug might be present in this method, and a suggestion would be to analyze the handling of types in the safe_cast method which might be causing the faulty behavior.
