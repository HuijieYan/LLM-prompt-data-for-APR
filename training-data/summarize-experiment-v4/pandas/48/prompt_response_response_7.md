## Bug Cause Analysis

The bug likely arises due to the handling of data types within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, particularly in the `safe_cast` method. The error message indicates a failure to cast an array from `dtype('float64')` to `dtype('int64')`, suggesting a discrepancy between the actual and expected data types during a casting operation. This discrepancy could stem from incorrect type inference or handling in the function's logic, leading to the erroneous behavior observed in the failing test cases.

## Potential Fix

To resolve the bug, it's necessary to carefully review the type handling and casting operations within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, especially in the context of aggregating data for different data types. It's crucial to ensure that the function handles nullable integer data types appropriately, reflecting changes introduced to data type handling in newer versions of pandas, as indicated by the GitHub issue.

## Corrected Code

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... (remaining implementation)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    if split_items:
        # Clean up the mess left over from split blocks.
        for locs, result in zip(split_items, split_frames):
            assert len(locs) == result.shape[1]
            for i, loc in enumerate(locs):
                new_items.append(np.array([loc], dtype=locs.dtype))
                # Explicitly cast the result values to their original data type
                cast_result = result.iloc[:, [i]]
                if cast_result.dtypes[0].type == np.int64:
                    cast_result = cast_result.astype('Int64')
                agg_blocks.append(cast_result._data.blocks[0])

    # ... (remaining implementation)

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code, the `split_items` handling explicitly casts the result values back to their original data type whenever necessary, ensuring that the behavior aligns with changes in data type handling for newer pandas versions. This approach aims to address the bug reported in the GitHub issue related to calling `mean` on a `DataFrameGroupBy` with `Int64` dtype, resolving the underlying data type casting discrepancies.
