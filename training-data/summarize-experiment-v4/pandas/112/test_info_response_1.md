Based on the error message and the stack trace, the issue appears to be related to the `get_indexer` method in the `IntervalIndex` class. Specifically, the error is caused by a `TypeError: No matching signature found` when the method is trying to get the indexer for the `target_as_index` values. The failing test is related to a case where the DataFrame has interval category columns and is being rounded, triggering the `get_indexer` method.
