Class docstring: The `IntervalIndex` class represents an immutable index of intervals that are closed on the same side. It has related methods such as `left()`, `right()`, `closed()`, `values()`, `dtype()`, `is_overlapping()`, `get_loc()`, `get_indexer()`, `where()`, `equals()`, `_maybe_convert_i8()`, and `_check_method()`.

`def left(self)`, `def right(self)`, `def closed(self)`, `def values(self)`, `def dtype(self)`, `def is_overlapping()`: These functions likely serve to provide information about the properties and characteristics of the intervals in the `IntervalIndex`.

`def _maybe_convert_i8(self, key)`: This function may handle the conversion of a given key to a certain data type, possibly related to integer values.

`def _check_method(self, method)`: This function probably checks the validity or existence of a specified method.

`def get_loc(self, key: Any, method: Optional[str]=None, tolerance=None) -> Union[int, slice, np.ndarray]`: This function likely retrieves the location or index of a given key within the `IntervalIndex`.

`def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str]=None, limit: Optional[int]=None, tolerance: Optional[Any]=None) -> np.ndarray`: This function is tasked with generating an indexer for the given target, possibly for the purpose of accessing or manipulating the elements within the `IntervalIndex`.

`def where(self, cond, other=None)`: This function is called to handle a conditional operation, which may involve comparing elements based on a certain condition.

`def equals(self, other) -> bool`: This function likely compares the `IntervalIndex` instance with another object to determine if they are equal.

Overall, the `get_indexer` method in the `IntervalIndex` class has various subordinate functions and methods that contribute to its functionality, including handling conversions, checking validity, and retrieving specific elements within the index. The presence of these related functions indicates a complex and interconnected structure within the `IntervalIndex` class.
