Help developers grasp why a function is failing by outlining its interactions with other functions or classes. Focus on the signatures and roles of related functions or classes to reveal how the problematic function fits within the larger codebase. Summarize related functions by refering to the example below. You should not solve the error directly.

## Example Buggy Function with Related Functions
```python
def log_action(action: str) -> None:
    # Details of this function are not the focal point

class DocumentProcessor:
    """
    This class processes documents by appending text, removing text, and updating the title.
    """

    def append_text(self, text: str) -> None:
        # The implementation details of this method are not our concern

    def remove_text(self, length: int) -> None:
        # Ignore the workings of this method

    def update_title(self, new_title: str) -> None:
        # The inner workings of this method are not relevant

    # The function with an issue needing attention
    def process_document(self, text_to_append: str, remove_chars: int, new_title: str) -> None:
        self.remove_text(remove_chars)
        self.append_text(text_to_append)
        self.update_title(new_title)
        log_action(f"Processed document " + self.title)
```

## Example Summary
Class docstring: This class processes documents by appending text, removing text, and updating the title. The related functions `append_text`, `remove_text`, and `update_title` are likely used to perform these operations.

`def remove_text(self, length: int) -> None`: This function likely takes a length parameter, which is presumably the number of characters to be removed from the start or end of the document.

`def append_text(self, text: str) -> None`: From the name of the function, we can infer that this function appends text to an existing document, which is maintained by the current class, `DocumentProcessor`.

`def update_title(self, new_title: str) -> None`: This function likely changes the internal record of the class to store a new title name.

`log_action()` function call: Prints a sequence of actions.
