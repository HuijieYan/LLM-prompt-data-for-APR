## Bug Cause

The bug likely occurs due to an inconsistency in handling the `target` index in the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class when it is of a specific type (CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex). This inconsistency leads to the erroneous `TypeError` during rounding operations.

## Approaches for Fixing the Bug

1. Verify the handling of the `target` index within the `get_indexer` method.
2. Check for any conditional statements or type checks related to the `target` index and ensure that they are correctly handling the specific type (CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex).
3. Evaluate the indexer generation process for the `target` index, which might be the source of the inconsistency.
4. Ensure that the method's functionality and interactions with related functions align with the expected behaviors for different types of indexes, including CategoricalIndex derived from IntervalIndex.

## Corrected Code

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # Implement a check for CategoricalIndex made from IntervalIndex
        if isinstance(target_as_index, CategoricalIndex) and isinstance(
            target_as_index.categories, IntervalIndex
        ):
            target_as_index = target_as_index.categories

        # The rest of the code remains unchanged
        # ...

    # The rest of the original code remains the same
    # ...

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```
The corrected code includes a check to handle the case where the `target` index is a CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex. This modification addresses the underlying inconsistency, ensuring that the `get_indexer` method correctly processes the `target_as_index` in such cases. This fix should allow the `round` method to work as expected even with interval category columns, resolving the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
