## Bug Cause Analysis

The potential error location within the buggy function is in the section that handles the case when `target_as_index` is not an instance of `IntervalIndex`. Specifically, the code that handles a heterogeneous scalar index using a loop and `get_loc` method may be causing the issue.

The error message, "TypeError: No matching signature found," suggests that there is an issue with the method signature or types of the arguments being passed to the method.

Based on the failing test case, the bug seems to occur when the `round` method is applied to a DataFrame with interval category columns which triggers the `get_indexer` method.

The function works correctly for certain input parameters, as it returns an indexer, but does not produce the expected output based on the failing test case and the error message provided in the GitHub issue.

## Approach to Fix the Bug

To fix the bug, the code responsible for handling the case when `target_as_index` is not an instance of `IntervalIndex` needs to be reviewed and potentially revised. Specifically, the logic for generating the indexer for a heterogeneous scalar index should be checked.

Additionally, it may be necessary to ensure that the input parameters and their types are compatible with the method signature and expected behavior.

## Corrected Code

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # existing logic for handling IntervalIndex
        # ...

    elif not is_list_like(target_as_index):
        # handle scalar index
        loc = self.get_loc(target_as_index)
        return np.array([loc], dtype="intp")
    else:
        # handle list-like index
        indexer = np.empty(len(target_as_index), dtype="intp")
        for i, key in enumerate(target_as_index):
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer[i] = loc

        return indexer

```

## Corrections Made
- Added a conditional block to handle scalar index separately, using `get_loc` directly to retrieve the indexer for the scalar value.
- Revised the loop for handling list-like index to create the indexer array and populate it with the results of `get_loc` for each element.

The corrected code addresses the potential issue with handling non-IntervalIndex target indexes and provides proper handling for scalar and list-like indexes.

This corrected code should address the bug related to the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
