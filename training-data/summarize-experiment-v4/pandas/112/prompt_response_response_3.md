Based on the information provided, the bug seems to be related to the failure of the `round()` method when the columns are of `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`. This issue triggers a `TypeError: No matching signature found` error.

The buggy function `get_indexer` likely has an issue with handling the conversion when the target index is of a specific type.

To fix the bug, one potential approach is to ensure that the `get_indexer` method can handle the conversion when the target index is of a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.

Here's a corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex) or isinstance(target_as_index, pd.CategoricalIndex):
        # Handle both IntervalIndex and CategoricalIndex made from an IntervalIndex
        if isinstance(target_as_index, pd.CategoricalIndex):
            target_as_index = ensure_index(target_as_index.categories)

        # rest of the code remains the same
        # ...

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected code, we added a check for `pd.CategoricalIndex` and ensured that the `target_as_index` is converted to a standard index if it is a `CategoricalIndex`. This modification allows the `get_indexer` method to handle the conversion when the target index is of a specific type, hopefully resolving the issue.

This fix should address the GitHub issue and ensure that the `round()` method works as expected even when the columns are of a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex`.
