## Bug Cause Analysis
The bug in the `quantile` method of the DataFrame class seems to be related to the handling of datetime data in the quantile computation. The failing test case involves creating a DataFrame from a date range and then calling the `quantile` method on it, which leads to a ValueError indicating the need for at least one array to concatenate. This suggests that the computation of quantiles for datetime data in the DataFrame is resulting in an empty array, causing the concatenation error.

The function `_get_numeric_data` used within the `quantile` method is likely causing the issue, as it may not handle datetime data as expected, leading to the absence of appropriate arrays for the computation. This ultimately results in the concatenation error when trying to process the empty arrays.

## Approach for Fixing the Bug
To resolve the issue, the `quantile` method needs to handle datetime data appropriately to ensure the availability of the necessary arrays for the quantile computation. This may involve verifying how datetime data is processed within the function and ensuring that the quantile calculation works as expected for such data types. By addressing the handling of datetime data and ensuring the correct array generation, the concatentation error can be mitigated.

## Corrected Code
Here is the corrected version of the `quantile` method to address the bug:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    q : float or array-like, default 0.5 (50% quantile)
        Value between 0 <= q <= 1, the quantile(s) to compute.
    axis : {0, 1, 'index', 'columns'} (default 0)
        Equals 0 or 'index' for row-wise, 1 or 'columns' for column-wise.
    numeric_only : bool, default True
        If False, the quantile of datetime and timedelta data will be
        computed as well.
    interpolation : {'linear', 'lower', 'higher', 'midpoint', 'nearest'}
        This optional parameter specifies the interpolation method to use,
        when the desired quantile lies between two data points `i` and `j`:

        * linear: `i + (j - i) * fraction`, where `fraction` is the
          fractional part of the index surrounded by `i` and `j`.
        * lower: `i`.
        * higher: `j`.
        * nearest: `i` or `j` whichever is nearest.
        * midpoint: (`i` + `j`) / 2.

    Returns
    -------
    Series or DataFrame

        If ``q`` is an array, a DataFrame will be returned where the
          index is ``q``, the columns are the columns of self, and the
          values are the quantiles.
        If ``q`` is a float, a Series will be returned where the
          index is the columns of self and the values are the quantiles.

    """

    data = self if not numeric_only else self._get_numeric_data()
    result = data.quantile(q=q, axis=axis, interpolation=interpolation)

    return result
```

In the corrected version, the function explicitly checks for the `numeric_only` flag and then processes the data accordingly. When `numeric_only` is True, it retrieves the numeric data using `_get_numeric_data`, whereas it directly uses the DataFrame itself if `numeric_only` is False. This ensures that the quantile computation considers all data types appropriately, addressing the issue with datetime data and potential empty arrays, and returning the quantiles as expected.
