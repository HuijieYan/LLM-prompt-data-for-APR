The potential error location within the buggy function appears to be in the concatenation of arrays during the quantile computation, specifically in the `quantile` method of the `DataFrame` class.

The bug's cause seems to be related to the handling of empty DataFrames and their initialization within the `quantile` computation process. The failing test is triggering a `ValueError` with the description "need at least one array to concatenate," indicating an issue with array concatenation in the quantile method.

Approaches for fixing the bug could involve implementing conditional logic to handle empty DataFrame cases and prevent the concatenation of empty arrays during the quantile computation.

Here is the corrected code for the `quantile` method addressing the empty DataFrame issue:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    ... (rest of the docstring remains the same) ...

    """
    self._check_percentile(q)

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if data.empty:
        return self._constructor()

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In this corrected code, a conditional check for an empty DataFrame is added at the beginning of the `quantile` method. If the DataFrame is empty, the method returns a newly constructed DataFrame using the `_constructor` method to avoid the concatenation of empty arrays and prevent the `ValueError`. This approach aims to handle the empty DataFrame case and ensure the `quantile` computation behaves as expected, resolving the issue posted in the GitHub report.
