The failing test `test_quantile_empty_no_columns` is triggering an error in the `quantile` method of the `DataFrame` class. The error originates from the `quantile` method in the `pandas/core/frame.py` file, which invokes the `quantile` from the internal data manager in `pandas/core/internals/managers.py`. The specific error message indicates a `ValueError` with the description "need at least one array to concatenate." This suggests that the error is related to the concatenation of empty arrays in the `quantile` method.
