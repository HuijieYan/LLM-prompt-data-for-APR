The relevant input/output values are:
- Input parameters: 
  - q (value: 0.5, type: float)
  - numeric_only (value: True, type: bool)
  - axis (value: 0, type: int)
  - interpolation (value: 'linear', type: str)
- Output: 
  - result (type: DataFrame)

Rational: The relevant input parameters are the ones that could influence the computation of the quantile, and the output type is important to verify the correctness of the function's return. The runtime variable values show that the function is working with an empty DataFrame, which might explain why the quantile computation is not producing the expected result. Therefore, the bug is likely related to the internal handling of the DataFrame and its lack of appropriate initialization.
