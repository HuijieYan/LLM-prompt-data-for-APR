The stack trace of the failing test indicates that the error occurs inside the `_get_grouper` function at the statement `raise KeyError(gpr)` on line 609. This error occurs when the function tries to create Grouping objects, indicating multiple groupers or index mappings, based on the passed in references and the group axis. The error indicates that the key `'x'` is not found in the index, leading to a `KeyError`. This is consistent with the test data and the error message. The error message is a result of a group name `'x'` that cannot be found in the index of the dataframe being grouped.
