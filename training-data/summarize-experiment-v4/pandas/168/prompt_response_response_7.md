The potential error location within the `_get_grouper` function is when it tries to create Grouping objects based on the passed-in references and the group axis.

The bug's cause is related to the interaction between the 'key' parameter and the calculation of the 'group_axis' variable. Specifically, the error occurs when the function tries to create Grouping objects, indicating multiple groupers or index mappings, based on the passed-in references and the group axis. The error indicates that the key `'x'` is not found in the index, leading to a `KeyError`.

To fix the bug, we can modify the logic for handling the 'key' parameter and determining the 'group_axis' variable.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (other parts of the function)

    if not isinstance(key, Grouper) and is_scalar(key) and key not in group_axis:
        raise KeyError(key)

    # ... (rest of the function)

```

In this correction, we check if the 'key' is not an instance of Grouper, and if it is a scalar and not found in the 'group_axis'. If these conditions are met, a `KeyError` is raised, which should handle the scenario where the key is not found in the index.

This update should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post and ensure that the function passes the failing test case.
