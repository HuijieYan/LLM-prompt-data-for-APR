## The source code of the buggy function

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python

from pandas.core.dtypes.common import ensure_categorical, is_categorical_dtype, is_datetime64_dtype, is_hashable, is_list_like, is_scalar, is_timedelta64_dtype

from pandas.core.groupby.ops import BaseGrouper
from pandas.core.index import CategoricalIndex, Index, MultiIndex
from pandas.core.series import Series

The buggy function is under file: `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/bgp_envs_local/repos/pandas_168/pandas/core/groupby/grouper.py`

Here is the buggy function:
```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,

    observed=False,

    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    Groupers are ultimately index mappings. They can originate as:
    index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers

    Groupers enable local references to axis,level,sort, while
    the passed in axis, level, and sort are 'global'.

    This routine tries to figure out what the passing in references
    are and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into
    a BaseGrouper.

    values

## Summary of Related Functions

Class docstrings: The class related to the buggy function is not explicitly mentioned, but it likely deals with grouping and processing data based on certain criteria.

_related functions signatures and roles_:

`_get_grouper(obj, key=None, axis=0, level=None, sort=True, observed=False, mutated=False, validate=True)`: This function creates and returns a BaseGrouper, an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers. It seems to handle the logic for creating groupers based on the provided parameters and validating the input.

`_is_label_like(val)`: This function likely checks if a given value is a label-like object. It might be used for validation or conditional checks within the `_get_grouper` function.

`_get_grouper(self, obj, validate=True)`: This function takes an object and a validation flag, likely serving a similar role to the first `_get_grouper` function but with a different set of parameters.

`is_in_axis(key)`: This function appears to check if a specified key is present in the axis.

`is_in_obj(gpr)`: This function checks for the presence of a specified object.

The `_get_grouper` function is quite lengthy and appears to handle the creation and validation of groupers for data processing. However, based on the signatures and roles of related functions, it seems to rely on validation, checking for the presence of keys and objects, and creating internal mappings for grouping data.

Understanding the interactions with these related functions can help in diagnosing why the `_get_grouper` function might be failing.


## Summary of the test cases and error messages

The stack trace of the failing test indicates that the error occurs inside the `_get_grouper` function at the statement `raise KeyError(gpr)` on line 609. This error occurs when the function tries to create Grouping objects, indicating multiple groupers or index mappings, based on the passed in references and the group axis. The error indicates that the key `'x'` is not found in the index, leading to a `KeyError`. This is consistent with the test data and the error message. The error message is a result of a group name `'x'` that cannot be found in the index of the dataframe being grouped.


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The relevant input/output values are
- Input parameters: obj (DataFrame with specific structure), axis (value: 1, type: int), key (value: 'x', type: str)
- Output: group_axis (Series or Index with specific structure including name 'x'), keys (value: ['x'], type: list)
Rational: The bug appears to be related to the processing of the 'key' parameter and the 'group_axis' variable. In all cases, the 'key' is set to 'x', and the 'group_axis' variable also has the 'x' label as part of its structure. Because of this consistency, it's likely that the issue lies in the interaction between the 'key' parameter and the calculation of the 'group_axis' variable.


## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

The given function `_get_grouper` is a lengthy and complex function that seems to be related to the process of creating and returning a BaseGrouper, which is an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers. It involves multiple checks and conditional statements to handle different cases of input parameters. The function uses various data structures such as DataFrames, Indexes, and BlockManagers to perform these operations.

The expected values and types of variables during the failing test execution are quite complex and involve multiple nested conditions. The function seems to be poorly structured and difficult to follow due to its length and excessive branching.

These tests are focused on checking the function's behavior with different input parameter values, such as obj, axis, key, validate, sort, observed, and mutated. The expected values and types of relevant variables right before the function's return are also outlined for each case. The function involves handling different scenarios involving keys, groupings, exclusions, and different data structures associated with the input parameters.

Overall, the function's complexity and the expected values and types of variables make it difficult to understand and reason about. Further refactoring, code simplification, and improved documentation could help in clarifying the purpose and behavior of the function.


## A GitHub issue for this bug

The issue's title:
```text
GroupBy(axis=1) Does Not Offer Implicit Selection By Columns Name(s)
```

The issue's detailed description:
```text
Code Sample, a copy-pastable example if possible
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

df = pd.DataFrame(np.arange(12).reshape(3, 4), index=[0, 1, 0], columns=[10, 20, 10, 20])
df.index.name = "y"
df.columns.name = "x"

print df

print
print "Grouped along index:"
print df.groupby(by="y").sum()

print
print "Grouped along columns:"
# The following raises a KeyError even though  "x" is a column name
# (like "y" above, which is an index name):
df.groupby(by="x", axis=1).sum()
Problem description
The exception at the end is surprising: the intent is clearly to group by columns, on the "x" column label.

Furthermore, the documentation for groupby() seems to confirm this, as it states for the "by" argument that "A str or list of strs may be passed to group by the columns in self".

Expected Output
A dataframe with index [0, 1, 0] but grouped (and summed) columns [10, 20].

I wasn't able to test with the latest Pandas version, sorry!
```
