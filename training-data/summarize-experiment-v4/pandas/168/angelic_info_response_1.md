The given function `_get_grouper` is a lengthy and complex function that seems to be related to the process of creating and returning a BaseGrouper, which is an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers. It involves multiple checks and conditional statements to handle different cases of input parameters. The function uses various data structures such as DataFrames, Indexes, and BlockManagers to perform these operations.

The expected values and types of variables during the failing test execution are quite complex and involve multiple nested conditions. The function seems to be poorly structured and difficult to follow due to its length and excessive branching.

These tests are focused on checking the function's behavior with different input parameter values, such as obj, axis, key, validate, sort, observed, and mutated. The expected values and types of relevant variables right before the function's return are also outlined for each case. The function involves handling different scenarios involving keys, groupings, exclusions, and different data structures associated with the input parameters.

Overall, the function's complexity and the expected values and types of variables make it difficult to understand and reason about. Further refactoring, code simplification, and improved documentation could help in clarifying the purpose and behavior of the function.
