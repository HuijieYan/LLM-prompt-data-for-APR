The relevant input/output values are
- Input parameters: obj (DataFrame with specific structure), axis (value: 1, type: int), key (value: 'x', type: str)
- Output: group_axis (Series or Index with specific structure including name 'x'), keys (value: ['x'], type: list)
Rational: The bug appears to be related to the processing of the 'key' parameter and the 'group_axis' variable. In all cases, the 'key' is set to 'x', and the 'group_axis' variable also has the 'x' label as part of its structure. Because of this consistency, it's likely that the issue lies in the interaction between the 'key' parameter and the calculation of the 'group_axis' variable.
