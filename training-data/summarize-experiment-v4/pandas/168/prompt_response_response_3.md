## Bug Location

The bug likely lies in the conditional logic for handling the 'key' parameter in the `_get_grouper` function. Specifically, the check for the presence of the specified key in the 'group_axis' is problematic and leads to a `KeyError` when the key is not found in the index.

## Bug Cause

The bug seems to be caused by the conditional statements that handle the 'key' parameter processing. When checking for the presence of the specified key in the 'group_axis', the function raises a `KeyError` if the key is not found. This is consistent with the reported GitHub issue where the intent is to group by columns on the "x" label, but the KeyError is raised for unknown reasons.

## Bug Fix

A potential approach to fixing the bug could involve revisiting the conditional logic that checks for the presence of the specified key in the 'group_axis'. The function may need to handle cases where the key is not found differently to avoid raising a `KeyError`. The conditional statements related to key processing could also be simplified and refactored to improve readability and maintainability.

## Corrected Code

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (other parts of the function)

    for i, (gpr, level) in enumerate(zip(keys, levels)):
        # ... (other logic)

        if isinstance(gpr, Grouper) and gpr.key is not None:
            exclusions.append(gpr.key)
            in_axis, name = False, None
            continue  # Skip processing for Grouper with no key

        if gpr not in group_axis and not obj._is_level_reference(gpr):
            raise ValueError(f"Key '{gpr}' not found in group axis")

        # ... (other parts of the logic)

    # ... (rest of the function)

```

In the corrected code, an additional conditional statement is added to handle cases where the 'key' is not found in the 'group_axis'. Rather than raising a `KeyError`, a `ValueError` is raised with a more informative message. This change aims to address the reported issue and prevent unexpected errors when grouping by columns.
