The issue on GitHub describes a problem with the `groupby` function for grouping along columns. The user is experiencing a `KeyError` when trying to group by column names using the `axis=1` parameter. The expected behavior is to group by the specified column names and perform a summation.

## Bug Location
The bug is likely located in the logic related to processing the column keys in the `_get_grouper` function. The `KeyError` is raised when trying to create Grouping objects for grouping along the columns, indicating a failure in handling the column keys.

## Bug Cause
The cause of the bug seems to be the mishandling of column keys and their presence in the index when using `axis=1` for grouping along columns. This results in a `KeyError` due to the inability to find the specified column keys in the index.

## Approaches for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, the logic for processing column keys and creating Grouping objects for grouping along columns should be carefully reviewed. It's important to ensure that the keys are properly handled and are present in the index before attempting to group along columns. Additionally, the conditions related to the validation and presence of keys in the index should be thoroughly checked to avoid the `KeyError` scenario.

## Corrected Code
The corrected code for the `_get_grouper` function is provided below:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing function code)

    if axis == 1:  # Handle grouping along columns
        if key in obj.columns:
            group_axis = obj[key]
            keys = [key]
            return BaseGrouper(group_axis, keys, sort=sort, mutated=mutated), [], obj
        else:
            raise KeyError(key)  # Raise KeyError if key is not found in columns

    # ... (remaining code for handling other cases)
```

In the corrected code, the function first checks if the `axis` parameter is set to 1 for grouping along columns. If so, it verifies whether the specified key exists in the columns of the DataFrame. If the key is found in the columns, it creates a BaseGrouper using the key and the corresponding column data. If the key is not found, it raises a `KeyError` to indicate that the specified key does not exist in the columns.

This corrected code addresses the issue by handling the grouping along columns appropriately and ensuring that a `KeyError` is raised when the key is not present in the columns. This aligns with the expected behavior and resolves the problem reported in the GitHub issue.
