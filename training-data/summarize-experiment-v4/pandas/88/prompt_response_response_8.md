### Bug Cause

The bug appears to be caused by the condition `if table.columns.nlevels > 1` in the `pivot_table` function, resulting in an AttributeError when trying to access the 'columns' attribute of a 'Series' object.

### Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug:
1. Check the type of `table` to ensure it's a DataFrame before accessing the 'columns' attribute.
2. Address the condition `if table.columns.nlevels > 1` to handle the case when `table` is a DataFrame or a Series.

### Corrected Code

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        # as before
        return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)

    keys = index + columns

    # as before

    if values_passed:
        # as before
    else:
        # as before

    grouped = data.groupby(keys, observed=observed)
    agged = grouped.agg(aggfunc)

    # Handle the case when 'agged' is a Series
    if isinstance(agged, ABCSeries):
        agged = agged.to_frame()

    # The remaining code can remain unchanged
    # ...

    return table
```

The corrected code checks for the type of `agged` and converts it to a DataFrame if it's a Series before the condition `if table.columns.nlevels > 1`. This fix ensures that the 'columns' attribute can be safely accessed without encountering an AttributeError for a 'Series' object.
