Based on the failing test cases, the stack trace, and the error message, the issue seems to be that the 'pivot_table' function from 'pandas/core/reshape/pivot.py' is raising an AttributeError: 'Series' object has no attribute 'columns' when trying to access the column attributes, which in turn leads to a failure in the 'test_pivot_table_multiindex_only' test. It is likely that the 'columns' related operations performed within the 'pivot_table' function result in a 'Series' object, causing the AttributeError when trying to access the 'columns' attribute. The stack trace seems to point to the condition `table.columns.nlevels > 1` in the 'pivot_table' function as a potential problem area. The failing test cases involve different combinations of 'cols', and the issue seems to be consistently occurring while calling the 'pivot_table' with multi-index columns.
