The failing tests `test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex` and `test_unstack_mixed_type_name_in_multiindex` both produce nearly identical error messages. The key error is raised at `pandas/core/indexes/multi.py` in the method `_get_level_number` while trying to access the index `level`. The failing function `_unstack_multiple` in the same file triggers the key error. The error is likely to have occurred due to issues with retrieving the corresponding levels for the multi-index. The failing line is this: `level = self.names.index(level)`. This is consistent in both test cases, indicating that the `_unstack_multiple` function is causing the error due to improper index retrieval. Therefore, the issue is with the function's handling of multi-indexes during unstacking.
