Related function `unstack(obj, level, fill_value=None)`: This function is utilized by the buggy function `_unstack_multiple` to perform some level of data unstacking. It takes an `obj` parameter, which is presumably the data to unstack, a `level` parameter, and an optional `fill_value` parameter.

`_unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None)`: This function seems to be responsible for unstacking the provided data based on the level locations (`clocs`). It appears to involve a complex process, including handling hierarchical columns and creating new indices and columns.

The significance of `unstack` and its interaction with the problematic function `_unstack_multiple` could potentially provide insights into why `_unstack_multiple` is failing.
