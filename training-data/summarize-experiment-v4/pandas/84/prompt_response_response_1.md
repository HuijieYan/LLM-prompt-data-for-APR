The potential error in the `_unstack_multiple` function lies in its handling of MultiIndex, specifically in the following portion of the code:

```python
clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
```

This is where the `_get_level_number` method of the MultiIndex object is used to fetch the level index. Considering the failing tests and error messages, the bug seems to be caused by the incorrect handling of MultiIndex levels. This has led to a KeyError being raised when trying to retrieve the level's index, as evidenced by the error message "KeyError: 'Level A not found'."

The error is particularly pronounced when the input data involves MultiIndexes and raises specific issues when the levels involved are not correctly handled. The failing tests clearly illustrate this issue, indicating that the function has problems with fetching level numbers from MultiIndex when dealing with tuple names.

To fix the bug, the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to be updated to appropriately handle levels in MultiIndex objects, especially when they involve tuple names. This requires proper resolution of the level names and number fetch from the MultiIndex object.

Additionally, the function's logic should be revised to ensure that both single and multi-level indexes are correctly handled for unstacking operations.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    cidx = data.index

    # Adjusted the code to handle tuples as levels in MultiIndex
    if isinstance(cidx, MultiIndex) and all(isinstance(level, tuple) for level in clocs):
        clocs = [cidx._get_level_number(level) for level in clocs]
    else:
        clocs = [cidx.names.index(level) if level in cidx.names else cidx._get_level_number(level) for level in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(cidx.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [cidx.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [cidx.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [cidx.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [cidx.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [cidx.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [cidx.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
            result = data
            for i in range(len(clocs)):
                val = clocs[i]
                result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
                clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]

            return result

        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

The corrected code covers the handling of MultiIndexes with tuple names and ensures that level numbers and names are properly fetched. It also addresses the need for resolving issues with multi-level indexes, ensuring that both single and multi-level indexes are correctly handled for unstacking operations.
