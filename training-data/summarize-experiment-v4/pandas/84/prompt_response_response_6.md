The bug appears to be in the `_unstack_multiple` function related to the way it handles MultiIndex data. The failing tests `test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex` and `test_unstack_mixed_type_name_in_multiindex` both produce nearly identical error messages related to accessing index levels, indicating that this is where the issue lies.

The failing function `_unstack_multiple` is triggering a key error at `level = self.names.index(level)` while trying to access the index `level`. The root cause of the error is likely the function's improper handling of multi-indexes.

To resolve this bug, we can modify the function to properly handle multi-index data. Specifically, the issue seems to occur during the extraction of level numbers and subsequent operations involving the index.

Below is the corrected function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]
    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)
    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    # Creating a dummy index that captures the reshaped structure
    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )
    
    # Ensure a copy of the data is manipulated
    dummy = data.copy()
    dummy.index = dummy_index

    # Unstack the dummy data
    unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
    
    if isinstance(data, Series):
        new_columns = MultiIndex.from_product([unstacked.columns.levels[0], clevels], names=[data.name] + cnames)
        unstacked.columns = new_columns
    else:
        new_columns = MultiIndex.from_product([unstacked.columns.levels[0], clevels], names=[data.columns.names[0]] + cnames)
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

In the corrected code, we ensure that the MultiIndex is handled properly, and that the reshaped data is assigned to a new index and unstacked according to the expected structure. This should resolve the issue with `_unstack_multiple` that previously produced the KeyErrors.
