## Bug Cause

The bug is likely caused by the function's attempt to convert boolean values to datetime, leading to a `TypeError` and resulting in a failed test. Given the details provided, it seems that the function is mishandling boolean values when attempting to parse them as dates, leading to unexpected behavior and an error.


## Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function, we can modify the conversion logic to handle boolean values separately and avoid attempting to convert them to datetime. Instead, the function should return the input data as is if it contains boolean values, while only performing date parsing for other data types.


## Corrected Code

Here's the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function that addresses the bug and resolves the issue:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "bool":
        # If the data type is boolean, return the input data as is
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    else:
        new_data = data

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

The corrected code now properly handles boolean values, returning the input data as is if the data type is boolean. It also ensures that date parsing is only performed for other data types, addressing the issue related to the failed test. This should resolve the problem reported in the GitHub issue and ensure that the function behaves as intended.
