The given function `_try_convert_to_date` is intended to parse an ndarray into a date column, handling various data types and formats. However, the function does not behave as expected and needs to be corrected. 

In the failing test case 1, the input consists of data with the value `RangeIndex(start=0, stop=3, step=1)` and type `RangeIndex`, `self.min_stamp` with a value of `31536000` and type `int`, and `self._STAMP_UNITS` with a value of `('s', 'ms', 'us', 'ns')` and type `tuple`. The expected values and types of variables right before the function's return are `new_data` with the expected value `RangeIndex(start=0, stop=3, step=1)` and type `RangeIndex`, `new_data.dtype` with the expected value `dtype('int64')` and type `dtype`, `in_range` with the expected value `array([False, False, False])` and type `ndarray`, and `new_data._values` with the expected value `array([0, 1, 2])` and type `ndarray`.

It is implied that the function should handle the input data appropriately, converting it to the desired date format and returning a boolean value indicating whether the parsing was successful. The function should also handle different data types and formats as specified in the summary.
