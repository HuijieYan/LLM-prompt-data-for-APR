Class docstring: The class Parser likely contains functions for parsing and converting data, including the `_try_convert_to_date` function.

`def _try_convert_to_date(self, data)`: This function appears to attempt to convert a ndarray-like input into a date column. It seems to handle different data types and units, and returns a boolean indicating whether the parsing was successful.

The bug in this function is likely related to the parsing of the input data, as well as the handling of different data types and units. The interactions with the `np.number`, `isna()`, `to_datetime()`, and `iNaT` functions could provide insight into the source of the error. Understanding how the input data is processed and converted within the function, as well as the conditions for successful parsing, will help in identifying and resolving the issue.
