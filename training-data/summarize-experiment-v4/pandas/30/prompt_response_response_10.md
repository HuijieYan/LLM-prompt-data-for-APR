## Bug's Cause

The bug appears to be caused by the `_try_convert_to_date` function incorrectly handling the conversion of boolean values to datetime objects. This is likely due to the logic for parsing and converting the input data, as well as the handling of different data types and formats within the function.

The failing test case `test_readjson_bool_series` triggers the exception while trying to convert a boolean value from a JSON array to a datetime object, causing the test to fail. This indicates that the function is not behaving as expected and needs to be corrected to handle the input data appropriately and return the expected boolean values.

The provided GitHub issue also highlights the problem, indicating that the function should return a Series of boolean values, but instead raises a `TypeError` when trying to convert boolean values to datetime. This inconsistency with the expected output, as well as the behavior in older Pandas versions, further confirms the existence of the bug.


## Approaches for Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function:
1. Review the logic for parsing and converting the input data to ensure it correctly handles boolean values and other data types.
2. Check the conditions for successful parsing and ensure that boolean values are appropriately handled without raising a `TypeError`.
3. Test various inputs, including boolean values, to verify that the function returns the expected output of a Series of boolean values.

By addressing these issues, the function should be able to correctly parse boolean values and return the expected output, resolving the bug and aligning with the behavior in older Pandas versions as well as the expected output indicated in the GitHub issue.


## Corrected Code

Here is the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray-like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # handle boolean values
    if new_data.dtype == "bool":
        return new_data, False

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

In the corrected code:
- Added a handling for boolean values to return the data and a boolean indicating unsuccessful parsing.
- This ensures that the function properly handles boolean values and returns the expected output, resolving the bug in parsing boolean values to datetime objects.
- The other parts of the function remain unchanged to maintain their intended functionality.

With these modifications, the function should now correctly handle boolean values and return the expected output, satisfying the failing test case and resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
