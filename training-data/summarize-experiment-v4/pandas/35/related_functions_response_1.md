Class docstring: The `PeriodIndex` class represents an immutable ndarray holding ordinal values indicating regular periods in time. It also includes a list of attributes and methods for working with periods.

`_engine` function: This function is a property method with caching enabled, and it is used to access the underlying engine for the `PeriodIndex` class. It returns an instance of `_engine_type` with the current `PeriodIndex` and its length as parameters.

`_engine_type` class: This class likely represents the engine used by the `PeriodIndex` class for performing operations on period data.

`len(self)` call: This likely returns the length of the `PeriodIndex` object, which is used as a parameter when initializing the engine.

Overall, the `PeriodIndex` class seems to be responsible for representing and working with periods in time, and the `_engine` function is related to accessing the underlying engine for this purpose. There might be issues with the caching or the underlying engine that could be causing the function to fail.
