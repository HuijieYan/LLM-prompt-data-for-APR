The potential error location within the buggy function is the use of the weakref module. It seems that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object is being dropped prematurely, causing the `_engine` variable to receive a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

Bug Cause Elucidation:
(a) Buggy Function: The `_engine` function uses weakref.ref to create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object self, and then passes it to `_engine_type` to create an engine instance.
(b) Buggy Class Docs: The `PeriodIndex` class represents an immutable ndarray of ordinal values indicating regular periods in time.
(c) Failing Test: The failing test 'test_get_level_values_when_periods' in the file `pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py` is failing at line 105, related to the engine's attribute 'view' returning a `NoneType`.
(d) Corresponding Error Message: The error occurs in the function `_do_monotonic_check` in the file `pandas/_libs/index.pyx`.
(e) Actual Input/Output: The input values are `self._values: <PeriodArray> ['2019Q1', '2019Q2']` and `self: PeriodIndex(['2019Q1', '2019Q2'], dtype='period[Q-DEC]', freq='Q-DEC')`. The error likely happens during the creation of the engine instance.
(f) Expected Input/Output: The expected output is the engine instance associated with the input period index. The output value and type of the `_engine` variable are not provided.
(g) GitHub Issue: The issue titled 'BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs' describes a similar problem, indicating that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object is dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

Suggested approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Avoid premature dropping of the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object.
2. Ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object remains valid during the creation of the engine instance.

Corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    length = len(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_weakref, length)
```

In the corrected code, a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is created and stored in the variable `period_weakref`. This weak reference is then used, along with the length of the `PeriodIndex`, to create the engine instance. This should prevent premature dropping of the weak reference and resolve the issue with the engine's attribute 'view' returning a `NoneType`.
