The issue occurs because the weak reference of the `PeriodIndex` object is being dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. To fix the bug, the weak reference should be maintained until it is no longer needed by the `PeriodEngine`.

Here is the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))

    return engine
```

In this fixed code, the `_engine` function now maintains a weak reference to `self` when initializing the `engine` instance. This should prevent the issue of the weak reference being dropped prematurely.

By making this change, the function should now return the engine instance associated with the input period index, and the issue described in the GitHub report should be resolved.
