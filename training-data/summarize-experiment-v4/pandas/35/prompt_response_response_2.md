Based on the analysis, it seems that the issue lies with the weak reference setup in the `_engine` function, which leads to the engine receiving a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`. To fix the bug, the weak reference setup needs to be adjusted to ensure that the engine receives the correct `PeriodIndex` instance.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use weakref.proxy to create a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In this corrected code, we use `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`, ensuring that the engine receives the correct `PeriodIndex` instance.

With this correction, the function should now return the engine instance associated with the input period index, and it should resolve the issue reported on GitHub related to weak reference handling in `PeriodIndex` within `MultiIndex`.

This fix should address the specific bug by ensuring that the weak reference to `self` is created properly, preventing the engine from receiving a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.
