Based on the error message, the failing test 'test_get_level_values_when_periods' in the file pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py is failing at line 105. It seems that the bug lies within the index engine's attribute 'view', which is returning a 'NoneType' object. The error occurs in the function '_do_monotonic_check' in the file pandas/_libs/index.pyx. The failing line in the buggy function is indirectly related to this issue.
