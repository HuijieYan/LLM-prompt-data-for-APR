Based on the analysis, here's what we know:
1. The `_engine` function is a property method with caching enabled, used to access the underlying engine for the `PeriodIndex` class. It returns an instance of `_engine_type` with the current `PeriodIndex` and its length as parameters.
2. The failing test 'test_get_level_values_when_periods' in the file pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py is failing at line 105. The bug lies within the index engine's attribute 'view', which is returning a 'NoneType' object.
3. The relevant input values are self._values: `PeriodArray(['2019Q1', '2019Q2'])` and self: `PeriodIndex(['2019Q1', '2019Q2'], dtype='period[Q-DEC]', freq='Q-DEC')`.
4. The expected return value of the `_engine` function is not provided.

To fix the bug:
- Check the caching mechanism in the `_engine` function to ensure that the engine is not returning a 'NoneType' object.
- Validate the input values used to create _engine and ensure they are not causing the issue.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_instance = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    if engine_instance is not None:
        return engine_instance
    else:
        # If the engine instance is None, handle the error condition appropriately
        raise ValueError("Engine instance is None")
```

This correction includes a check for the engine instance before returning it. If the engine instance is None, it raises a ValueError. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
