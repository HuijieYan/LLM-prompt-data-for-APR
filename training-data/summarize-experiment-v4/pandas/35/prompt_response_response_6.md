The bug in the `_engine` function seems to be related to the weak reference to the `self` object being dropped prematurely, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`. This results in an error when checking if the period levels are monotonic in a multi-index scenario.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained properly until it is no longer needed by the `PeriodEngine`. This can be achieved by using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref` to create a weak reference to `self`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use weakref.proxy to maintain a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy`, we ensure that the weak reference to `self` remains valid until it is actually used by the `PeriodEngine`, thereby resolving the issue reported in the GitHub thread and ensuring the function returns the expected output.
