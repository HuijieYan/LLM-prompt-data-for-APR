The potential error location within the `_engine` function is the initialization of the `period` variable using `weakref.ref(self)`. This line of code may not be creating a valid weak reference to the `self` object, leading to issues with weak references to the `PeriodIndex` object.

The bug's cause is likely related to weak references not being properly maintained, leading to the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex` object.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `self` object is created and maintained properly before being passed to the `_engine_type` to initialize the engine. This will ensure that the `PeriodEngine` does not receive a `None` object instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    # Check if the weak reference is valid
    period = period_ref() 
    if period is not None:
        # Use the valid weak reference to initialize the engine
        return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    else:
        # If weak reference is not valid, return a default engine or handle the error appropriately
        return None  # Or raise an error, depending on the expected behavior
```

In this corrected version, we create a weak reference to `self` using `weakref.ref(self)`, then immediately check if the weak reference is valid. If it is valid, we use it to initialize the engine. Otherwise, we handle the case of an invalid weak reference by returning a default value or raising an error as appropriate.

This corrected code aims to address the issue of weak references not being properly maintained, ensuring that the `PeriodEngine` receives a valid `PeriodIndex` object.
