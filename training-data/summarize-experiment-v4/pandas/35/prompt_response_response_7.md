The potential error location within the buggy function:
The line `period = weakref.ref(self)` creates a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object, but it is not being properly used in the `_engine_type` instantiation.


Bug's cause:
(a) The buggy function: The `_engine` function is supposed to return the engine instance associated with the input period index, but it's not utilizing the weak reference properly.
(b) The buggy class docs: The `PeriodIndex` class represents an immutable ndarray holding ordinal values indicating regular periods in time.
(c) The failing test: The failing test 'test_get_level_values_when_periods' in the file pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py is failing at line 105, indicating that the bug is related to the index engine's 'view' attribute returning a 'NoneType' object.
(d) The corresponding error message: The error occurs in the function '_do_monotonic_check' in the file pandas/_libs/index.pyx.
(e) The actual input/output variable values: `self._values` is `<PeriodArray> ['2019Q1', '2019Q2']`, and `self` is `PeriodIndex(['2019Q1', '2019Q2'], dtype='period[Q-DEC]', freq='Q-DEC')`.
(f) The expected input/output variable values: The function should return the engine instance associated with the input period index.
(g) The GitHub Issue information: The issue describes a problem where the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped before intended, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.


Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the weak reference is properly utilized when creating the engine instance.
2. Check for any issues related to weak references and object lifecycle management in the `PeriodIndex` class and the engine implementation.
3. Validate the weak reference and its usage in initializing the engine.


The corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In this corrected code, instead of passing the weak reference `period` directly to `_engine_type`, we call `period()` to obtain the referent (the original `self` object) before passing it to `_engine_type`. This ensures that the weak reference is properly utilized, and the engine instance is initialized with the intended `PeriodIndex` object.

By making this change, the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information, successfully resolving the issue posted in GitHub.
