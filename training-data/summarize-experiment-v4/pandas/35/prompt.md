## The source code of the buggy function

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
import weakref
from pandas.util._decorators import Appender, cache_readonly, doc
```

The buggy function is under file: `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/bgp_envs_local/repos/pandas_35/pandas/core/indexes/period.py`

Here is the buggy function:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))

```


## Summary of Related Functions

Class docstring: The `PeriodIndex` class represents an immutable ndarray holding ordinal values indicating regular periods in time. It also includes a list of attributes and methods for working with periods.

`_engine` function: This function is a property method with caching enabled, and it is used to access the underlying engine for the `PeriodIndex` class. It returns an instance of `_engine_type` with the current `PeriodIndex` and its length as parameters.

`_engine_type` class: This class likely represents the engine used by the `PeriodIndex` class for performing operations on period data.

`len(self)` call: This likely returns the length of the `PeriodIndex` object, which is used as a parameter when initializing the engine.

Overall, the `PeriodIndex` class seems to be responsible for representing and working with periods in time, and the `_engine` function is related to accessing the underlying engine for this purpose. There might be issues with the caching or the underlying engine that could be causing the function to fail.


## Summary of the test cases and error messages

Based on the error message, the failing test 'test_get_level_values_when_periods' in the file pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py is failing at line 105. It seems that the bug lies within the index engine's attribute 'view', which is returning a 'NoneType' object. The error occurs in the function '_do_monotonic_check' in the file pandas/_libs/index.pyx. The failing line in the buggy function is indirectly related to this issue.


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The relevant input/output values are:
- self._values: `<PeriodArray> ['2019Q1', '2019Q2']`
- self: `PeriodIndex(['2019Q1', '2019Q2'], dtype='period[Q-DEC]', freq='Q-DEC')`

Rational: The input values of self._values and self are likely relevant to the bug as they are used to create _engine, and could potentially be causing the issue.


## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

Case 1: Given the input parameter `self=PeriodIndex(['2019Q1', '2019Q2'], dtype='period[Q-DEC]', freq='Q-DEC')`, the function should return the engine instance associated with the input period index. The output value and type of the `_engine` variable are not provided.


## A GitHub issue for this bug

The issue's title:
```text
BUG: Copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex loses weakrefs
```

The issue's detailed description:
```text
As per comment by @jacobaustin123:
import pandas as pd
idx = pd.MultiIndex.from_arrays([pd.PeriodIndex([pd.Period("2019Q1"), pd.Period("2019Q2")], name='b')])
idx2 = pd.MultiIndex.from_arrays([idx._get_level_values(level) for level in range(idx.nlevels)])
all(x.is_monotonic for x in idx2.levels) # raises an error

Problem description
The weakly referenced PeriodIndex er dropped before intended, so the PeriodEngine gets a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

Expected Output
The above should return True.
```
