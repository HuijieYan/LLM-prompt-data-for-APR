The potential error location within the buggy function is the line `period = weakref.ref(self)` where `weakref.ref` is used to create a weak reference to `self`. This weak reference is then used as a parameter when initializing the engine using `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`.

The bug's cause can be elucidated using:
(a) The buggy function: The `_engine` function is a property method with caching enabled, and it is used to access the underlying engine for the PeriodIndex class. It returns an instance of `_engine_type` with the current PeriodIndex and its length as parameters.
(b) The buggy class docs: The PeriodIndex class represents an immutable ndarray holding ordinal values indicating regular periods in time.
(c) The failing test: The failing test 'test_get_level_values_when_periods' is in the file pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py and is failing at line 105.
(d) The corresponding error message: The error occurs in the function '_do_monotonic_check' in the file pandas/_libs/index.pyx. The failing line in the buggy function is indirectly related to this issue.
(e) The actual input/output variable values: The input values of `self._values` and `self` are relevant, and they are `<PeriodArray> ['2019Q1', '2019Q2']` and `PeriodIndex(['2019Q1', '2019Q2'], dtype='period[Q-DEC]', freq='Q-DEC')` respectively.
(f) The expected input/output variable values: The function should return the engine instance associated with the input period index, but the output value and type of the `_engine` variable are not provided.
(g) The GitHub Issue information: The issue describes a related problem where weakly referenced PeriodIndex is dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to get a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained properly so that it is not dropped unexpectedly.
2. Verify that the engine instance is correctly created and associated with the PeriodIndex.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    # Use a strong reference to avoid premature dropping of the weak reference
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected code, the `weakref.ref` is replaced with `weakref.proxy` to ensure that a strong reference is maintained to the object, preventing premature dropping of the weak reference. This should address the issue with weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped before intended, resolving the bug and allowing the function to return the correct engine instance associated with the input period index.
