The potential error in in the buggy function might be related to the modifications and adjustments applied to the `other` datetime variable, as well as the calculations for business days and business hours. The issue seems to arise in handling the input parameters for `CustomBusinessHour` and `holidays` in `pd.date_range()`, resulting in unexpected output periods. 

To fix the bug, it's important to carefully review and correct the logic behind the adjustments for business days and business hours. It may also involve revisiting the handling of holidays and other business day offsets.

The corrected code for the buggy function `apply` in the `BusinessHourMixin` class is as follows:

```python
def apply(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, datetime):
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
    
    # Adjusting the timezone and nanosecond
    other = as_datetime(other).replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0)

    n = self.n

    if n >= 0 and (other.time() in self.end or not self.is_on_offset(other)):
        other = self._next_opening_time(other)
    elif n < 0 and (other.time() in self.start or not self.is_on_offset(other)):
        other = self._prev_opening_time(other) - timedelta(seconds=1)
        other = self._next_opening_time(self._get_closing_time(other))

    # Get total business hours by sec in one business day
    businesshours = sum(
        self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
        for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
    )

    bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
    if n < 0:
        bd, r = -bd, -r

    # Adjust by business days first
    if bd != 0:
        business_day_offset = BusinessDay(n=bd)
        other = business_day_offset.rollforward(other)

    # Remaining business hours to adjust
    bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

    # Adjust based on business hours
    while bhour_remain > timedelta(0):
        closing_time = self._get_closing_time(other)
        opening_time = self._next_opening_time(other)
        if n >= 0:
            bhour = closing_time - other
        else:
            bhour = opening_time - other

        if bhour_remain < bhour:
            other += bhour_remain
            break
        else:
            bhour_remain -= bhour
            other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

    return other
```

This corrected code is intended to handle the datetime adjustments and business hour calculations more accurately, addressing the offset and holiday issues reported in the GitHub issue.
