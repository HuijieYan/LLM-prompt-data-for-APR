The `BusinessHourMixin` class contains a buggy `apply` function, which seems to be related to business hours and time intervals. This function interacts with a number of other functions within the same class, such as `next_bday`, `_next_opening_time`, `_prev_opening_time`, `_get_business_hours_by_sec`, `_get_closing_time`, `is_on_offset`, and `_is_on_offset`. These functions likely handle calculations and validations related to business hours and time intervals. Additionally, there are other functions outside of the class that the buggy function interacts with, such as `apply_wraps` and `is_on_offset`.

The `apply` function seems to perform a series of time-based calculations and adjustments, possibly related to business days and business hours. The logic seems to involve checking the time intervals and making adjustments based on business day offsets and remaining business hours. The function also handles different cases based on the sign of the input parameter. The errors occurring in this function might be due to incorrect calculations or logic related to business time intervals and offsets.

It's important to review the interactions of the `apply` function with these related functions and classes to understand the context and potential sources of the issue.
