## The source code of the buggy function

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
from datetime import date, datetime, timedelta
from pandas._libs.tslibs.offsets import ApplyTypeError, BaseOffset, _get_calendar, _is_normalized, _to_dt64, apply_index_wraps, as_datetime, roll_yearday, shift_month
```

The buggy function is under file: `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/bgp_envs_local/repos/pandas_96/pandas/tseries/offsets.py`

Here is the buggy function:
```python

        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,

## Summary of Related Functions

The `BusinessHourMixin` class contains a buggy `apply` function, which seems to be related to business hours and time intervals. This function interacts with a number of other functions within the same class, such as `next_bday`, `_next_opening_time`, `_prev_opening_time`, `_get_business_hours_by_sec`, `_get_closing_time`, `is_on_offset`, and `_is_on_offset`. These functions likely handle calculations and validations related to business hours and time intervals. Additionally, there are other functions outside of the class that the buggy function interacts with, such as `apply_wraps` and `is_on_offset`.

The `apply` function seems to perform a series of time-based calculations and adjustments, possibly related to business days and business hours. The logic seems to involve checking the time intervals and making adjustments based on business day offsets and remaining business hours. The function also handles different cases based on the sign of the input parameter. The errors occurring in this function might be due to incorrect calculations or logic related to business time intervals and offsets.

It's important to review the interactions of the `apply` function with these related functions and classes to understand the context and potential sources of the issue.


## Summary of the test cases and error messages

The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in the `test_date_range.py` file resulted in a `ValueError` in the function `_validate_frequency` of the `pandas/core/indexes/datetimes.py` due to a mismatch between the inferred frequency from passed values and the passed frequency. The error message mentions that the inferred frequency `None` from the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency `CBH`. The stack trace includes the function `_validate_frequency()` and the creation of `DatetimeIndex`, which appears to be related to the error.


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

It seems that the buggy function is failing to properly adjust the datetime input based on the specified business hours. Each case shows that the variables `other` and `n` are relevant input values for the function, as well as the result `other` right before the return statement. 

The buggy function fails to handle adjustments and calculation of business hours properly, resulting in incorrect outputs for `other` in all cases. This may be due to issues with the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours, leading to incorrect datetime adjustments.

To fix this bug, the logic behind the adjustment of business days and remaining business hours needs to be carefully reviewed and corrected.


## A GitHub issue for this bug

The issue's title:
```text
Pandas date_range does not work when using periods and adding holiday
```

The issue's detailed description:
```text
This code works fine

pd.date_range(start='2020-11-25 10:00',periods=14,
              freq=pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour(start='10:00'))
but if I add holidays then it produces more than 14 periods

pd.date_range(start='2020-11-25 10:00',periods=14,
              freq=pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour(start='10:00',holidays=['2020-11-26']))
Output:

DatetimeIndex(['2020-11-25 10:00:00', '2020-11-25 11:00:00',
               '2020-11-25 12:00:00', '2020-11-25 13:00:00',
               '2020-11-25 14:00:00', '2020-11-25 15:00:00',

               '2020-11-27 11:00:00', '2020-11-27 12:00:00',
               '2020-11-27 13:00:00', '2020-11-27 14:00:00',

               '2020-11-30 14:00:00', '2020-11-30 15:00:00',
               '2020-11-30 16:00:00', '2020-12-01 10:00:00',
               '2020-12-01 11:00:00', '2020-12-01 12:00:00',
               '2020-12-01 13:00:00', '2020-12-01 14:00:00',
               '2020-12-01 15:00:00', '2020-12-01 16:00:00',
               '2020-12-02 10:00:00', '2020-12-02 11:00:00',
               '2020-12-02 12:00:00'],
              dtype='datetime64[ns]', freq='CBH')
If I replace periods with the corresponding end then everything works fine.

pd.date_range(start='2020-11-25 10:00',end='2020-11-27 16:00:00',
              freq=pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour(start='10:00',holidays=['2020-11-26']))
I am not sure why date_range has this weird behavior. Appreciate any help.
