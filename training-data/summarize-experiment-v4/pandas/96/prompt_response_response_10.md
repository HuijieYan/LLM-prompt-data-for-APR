The potential cause of the bug in the `apply` function of the `BusinessHourMixin` class seems to be related to incorrect calculations and adjustments of business days and business hours. The issues with the adjustment logic might be leading to incorrect outputs for the `other` variable, ultimately causing the failing test and the error reported in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours needs to be carefully reviewed and corrected. Specifically, the logic for adjusting business days and business hours based on the sign of the input parameter `n` should be thoroughly examined and adjusted.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # reset timezone, nanosecond, and microseconds
        other = other.replace(tzinfo=None, microsecond=0)
        
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other = other - timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        business_hours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        no_of_business_days, remaining_minutes = divmod(abs(n * 60), business_hours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            no_of_business_days, remaining_minutes = -no_of_business_days, -remaining_minutes

        if no_of_business_days != 0:
            skip_bdays = BusinessDay(n=no_of_business_days)
            if not self.is_on_offset(other + skip_bdays):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain_time = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bdays + remain_time
            else:
                other = other + skip_bdays

        remaining_business_hours = timedelta(minutes=remaining_minutes)

        if n >= 0:
            while remaining_business_hours != timedelta(0):
                business_hours_left = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if remaining_business_hours < business_hours_left:
                    other += remaining_business_hours
                    remaining_business_hours = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    remaining_business_hours -= business_hours_left
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + business_hours_left)
        else:
            while remaining_business_hours != timedelta(0):
                business_hours_left = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if remaining_business_hours >= business_hours_left:
                    other += remaining_business_hours
                else:
                    remaining_business_hours = timedelta(0)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + business_hours_left - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In this corrected version, the adjustment of business days and remaining business hours is handled based on the sign of the input parameter `n`. The logic for adjusting business days and business hours has been carefully reviewed and corrected to ensure proper datetime adjustments are made. This version should resolve the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
