The potential error in the `apply` function appears to be in the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours. The issue description on GitHub suggests that the `date_range` function does not work correctly when adding holidays to CustomBusinessHour frequencies. This aligns with the potential mismatch in business days and hours adjustment handled by the `apply` function.

To fix the bug, the logic behind the adjustment of business days and remaining business hours needs to be carefully reviewed and corrected. The adjustments of `other` and its related calculations based on the specified business hours and days need to be validated and adjusted where necessary to address the reported issue.

Here's a corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        if isinstance(other, date):
            other = datetime.combine(other, datetime.min.time())
        if self._is_on_offset(other):
            return other
        else:
            last_b_day = self._last_business_day(other, roll="backward")
            business_days = self._get_business_days(other, last_b_day)
            hours = self._get_business_hours(other, last_b_day)
            total_business_seconds = sum(
                h.total_seconds() for h in self.business_hours
            )
            total_seconds = (
                business_days * total_business_seconds * 10**9 +
                hours.total_seconds() * 10**9
            )
            n, m = divmod(self.roll_convert(self, total_seconds), 10**9)
            return other + timedelta(days=n, seconds=m)
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This correction involves refactoring the logic around adjustments and calculations to address the reported issue related to adding holidays to CustomBusinessHour frequencies. The adjustments of the `other` variable, business days, and hours have been revised to address the mismatch and produce the expected behavior. This should resolve the reported issue on GitHub and align with the expectations for the adjusted business hours.
