The potential error in the buggy function seems to be related to the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours. This likely leads to incorrect datetime adjustments, resulting in unexpected outputs. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in the `test_date_range.py` file resulted in a `ValueError` in the function `_validate_frequency` of the `pandas/core/indexes/datetimes.py` due to a frequency mismatch.

The cause of the bug can be elucidated by examining the failing test case and the error message, as well as analyzing the runtime variables and types in the buggy function. Additionally, understanding the context of the related functions and the specific interactions within the `BusinessHourMixin` class is crucial to identifying the underlying issue.

To fix the bug, the logic behind the adjustment of business days and remaining business hours within the `apply` function should be carefully reviewed and corrected. This may involve reevaluating how business days and business hours are adjusted based on the input parameters, as well as ensuring accurate calculations for datetime adjustments.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            while n > 0:
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                n -= 1
        else:
            while n < 0:
                other = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                n += 1

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected code, the adjustment logic for business days and remaining business hours has been simplified to ensure accurate datetime adjustments. The adjustments are now based on the sign of the input parameter `n` and utilize the `_next_opening_time` and `_prev_opening_time` functions to handle business day offsets. This correction aims to address the underlying issue reported in the GitHub thread and ensure that the `apply` function produces the expected outputs while passing the failing test case.
