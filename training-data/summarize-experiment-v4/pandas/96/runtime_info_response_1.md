It seems that the buggy function is failing to properly adjust the datetime input based on the specified business hours. Each case shows that the variables `other` and `n` are relevant input values for the function, as well as the result `other` right before the return statement. 

The buggy function fails to handle adjustments and calculation of business hours properly, resulting in incorrect outputs for `other` in all cases. This may be due to issues with the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours, leading to incorrect datetime adjustments.

To fix this bug, the logic behind the adjustment of business days and remaining business hours needs to be carefully reviewed and corrected.
