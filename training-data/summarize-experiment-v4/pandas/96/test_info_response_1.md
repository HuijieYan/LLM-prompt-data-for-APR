The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` in the `test_date_range.py` file resulted in a `ValueError` in the function `_validate_frequency` of the `pandas/core/indexes/datetimes.py` due to a mismatch between the inferred frequency from passed values and the passed frequency. The error message mentions that the inferred frequency `None` from the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency `CBH`. The stack trace includes the function `_validate_frequency()` and the creation of `DatetimeIndex`, which appears to be related to the error.
