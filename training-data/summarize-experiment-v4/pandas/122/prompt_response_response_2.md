## Bug's Cause

The bug seems to be caused by the faulty logic within the `equals` function of the BlockManager class. The function first compares the lengths of the axes and then attempts to consolidate the data in place. After that, it compares the individual data blocks between the two instances. However, the comparison logic does not seem to yield the expected results, as indicated by the failing test case "test_dataframe_not_equal" returning True instead of False.

## Fixing the Bug

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the comparison logic within the `equals` function accurately compares the internal components of the two instances. Additionally, the consolidation in place logic should be reviewed to ensure that it does not interfere with the comparison process.

## Corrected Code

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes(), block.dtype.name))
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes(), block.dtype.name))
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

This corrected code addresses the potential issues within the original `equals` function by ensuring that the comparison logic considers the block order and types. Additionally, the `canonicalize` function has been replaced with lambda functions to standardize the sorting mechanism for the blocks. With these changes, the function should accurately determine the equality of the two instances and pass the failing test case.
