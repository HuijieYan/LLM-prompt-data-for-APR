The potential error location within the buggy function is likely in the logic for comparing the self.blocks and other.blocks.

The bug's cause can be elucidated using the following information:
   (a) The buggy function compares the internal data and structure of two instances of the class, `BlockManager`, by checking the length of the axes, consolidating the data in place, and comparing the individual blocks of data between the two instances.
   (b) The related functions such as `as_array`, `canonicalize`, and `_consolidate_inplace` are likely used for internal data manipulation and comparison within the `BlockManager` class.
   (c) The failing test "test_dataframe_not_equal" in the file "pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py" is showing an assertion error, indicating that the method "equals" in the NDFrame class returns True instead of False when comparing two DataFrames, df1 and df2.
   (e) The corresponding error message states that the actual result is True, while the expected result is False.
   (f) The actual input/output variable values are known, while the expected values are derived from the failing test case in the error message.


To fix the bug, the logic for comparing the internal blocks of data between the two instances of the `BlockManager` class needs to be revised to ensure accurate comparison.

The corrected code for the buggy function is as follows:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.__class__.__name__, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By revising the canonicalize function to take into account the class name of the block and checking the lengths of the sorted blocks, the corrected code improves the accuracy of comparing the internal blocks of data between the two instances of the `BlockManager` class, ensuring that the equality comparison functions correctly. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
