Based on the error message, the failing test case "test_dataframe_not_equal" in the file "pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py" is showing an assertion error. The log indicated that the method "equals" in the NDFrame class is returning True instead of False when comparing two DataFrames, df1 and df2, causing the test to fail. The issue seems to be related to the implementation of the "equals" method in the buggy function, as it shows up directly in the method call context within the error message. The error indicates that the actual result is True, while the expected result is False. This will be the main focus for the developer to address when debugging the code.
