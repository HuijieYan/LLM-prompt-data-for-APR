Based on the information provided, the bug seems to be related to incorrect comparison logic within the `equals` method of the BlockManager class. The problem is specifically identified in the failing test case "test_dataframe_not_equal" in the file "pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py", which shows an assertion error. The error message indicates that the method "equals" in the NDFrame class is returning True instead of False when comparing two DataFrames, df1 and df2, causing the test to fail. The issue likely arises from incorrect data comparison or consolidation logic within the `equals` method.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic in the `equals` method needs to be carefully reviewed and potentially revised to accurately identify differences between the internal components of the two instances being compared. This may involve refining the logic for comparing the axes, consolidating the data, and comparing individual blocks to ensure accurate equality comparisons.

Here is the corrected code for the `equals` method in the BlockManager class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtypes, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code:
1. The `canonicalize` function defines a key for sorting the blocks based on their data types and locations.
2. The `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are sorted according to the `canonicalize` key before comparison.
3. The equality comparison now ensures that the individual blocks are accurately compared for equality.

With these corrections, the `equals` method should accurately compare the internal data and structure of the two instances, addressing the issue reported in the failing test case.
