Based on the information provided, the bug in the `equals` method within the `BlockManager` class seems to stem from the comparison of the internal blocks of data within the two instances. This likely leads to incorrect comparison results, causing the failing test case "test_dataframe_not_equal" to produce an assertion error.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic within the `equals` method needs to be revised to accurately compare the internal blocks of data. This may involve implementing a more robust comparison algorithm or ensuring that the internal data structures are properly consolidated and ordered before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        self_block.equals(other_block) for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the equality comparison of the internal blocks of data between the two instances is facilitated by iterating through each block and comparing them individually. This ensures that the comparison accounts for any potential differences in block locations and type names, resulting in more accurate equality comparisons.

This correction aims to address the issue reported in the GitHub bug, ensuring that the `equals` method returns the expected results for DataFrame comparisons.
