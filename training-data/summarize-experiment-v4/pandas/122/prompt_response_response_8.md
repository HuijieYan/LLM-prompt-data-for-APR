## Bug's Cause
The bug in the `equals` function of the BlockManager class is likely caused by the incorrect comparison of the individual blocks of data within the instances. Additionally, there might be an issue with the consolidation logic and the comparison of axes.

## Approaches for Fixing the Bug
1. Check the `equals` function's logic for comparing the individual blocks of data and ensure that it accurately identifies differences between the blocks.
2. Review the consolidation logic within the function to ensure that it properly handles the data in both instances.
3. Confirm that the comparison of axes accurately identifies discrepancies.

## Corrected Code

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.shape, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The corrected function ensures that the comparison of individual blocks accurately identifies differences and that the consolidation logic is properly handled.
