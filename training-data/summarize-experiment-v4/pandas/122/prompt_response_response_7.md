The potential error location is the comparison logic within the `equals` function, as it may not accurately distinguish between different blocks with different locations.

The bug's cause may be due to issues in how the function compares the blocks between the two instances, leading to incorrect equality comparisons.

To fix the bug, one approach could be to modify the comparison logic within the `equals` function to properly handle cases where identical blocks have different locations.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(sorted(block.mgr_locs.as_array)))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `canonicalize` function has been updated to use `tuple(sorted(block.mgr_locs.as_array))` to properly distinguish between different blocks with different locations. This change ensures that the comparison logic accurately handles identical blocks with different locations.

With this modification, the function should now pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and address the issue posted on GitHub.
