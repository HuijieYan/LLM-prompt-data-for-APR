Based on the provided information, the potential error location within the buggy function seems to be in the `equals` method of the BlockManager class. The issue may have originated from the comparison logic or the data consolidation process within the function.

The bug's cause seems to stem from a mismatch in the comparison logic within the `equals` method of the BlockManager class. This has led to the method returning True instead of False when comparing two DataFrames, df1 and df2, causing the failing test "test_dataframe_not_equal" in the file "pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py".

To fix the bug, the comparison logic in the `equals` method needs to be thoroughly reviewed, and potential issues related to data consolidation and comparison should be addressed. Specifically, the `canonicalize` function used for sorting blocks may be causing the unexpected behavior and should be reviewed for potential incorrect ordering or reflection of the data.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` method in the BlockManager class:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(block.values), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The correction involves modifying the `canonicalize` function to create a unique representation of the blocks for accurate comparison. This change should address the bug and ensure that the failing test "test_dataframe_not_equal" now passes as expected.
