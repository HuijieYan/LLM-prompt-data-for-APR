## Bug's Cause

The bug in the `equals` function of the BlockManager class may be caused by a discrepancy in the comparison logic when comparing the internal data structures of two instances. This likely results in the function returning True instead of False when the dataframes should not be considered equal. The discrepancy can also stem from issues related to data consolidation and standardization within the function.

## Potential Approach for Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug in the `equals` function, the developer should review the comparison logic within the function to ensure that it accurately compares the internal components of the two instances for equality. Additionally, the data consolidation and standardization processes need to be revisited to ensure consistent behavior and accurate comparison results.

## Corrected Code

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (hash(block.values.tobytes()), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `canonicalize` function now creates a unique representation of the block's data and location, ensuring accurate sorting and comparison. This approach helps address the issue related to identical blocks with different locations and helps the `equals` function return the correct result.

The corrected code aims to resolve the GitHub issue titled "BUG: DataFrame.equals() wrongly returns True in case of identical blocks with different locations" and should address the discrepancy in the `equals` function's behavior.
