## Bug's Cause

The bug may be caused by the logic used to compare the blocks in the `equals` function. The function is comparing the sorted blocks using a canonicalization function, and if the blocks have different locations, the comparison may incorrectly return True.


## Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, we can modify the comparison logic for the blocks in the `equals` function to account for different block locations. Additionally, we can ensure that the canonicalization function accurately captures the distinction between blocks with different locations.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)
    
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected code:
- The `canonicalize` function now returns a tuple of the block's data type name and its locations without converting it into a list. This preserves the distinction between blocks with different locations.
- The sorted blocks are now compared using the updated `canonicalize` function, ensuring that the comparison takes into account the block locations.

This corrected code should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the `equals` function properly compares the blocks, returning the expected result when comparing two DataFrames.
