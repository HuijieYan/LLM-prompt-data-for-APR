In the provided example, the buggy function is a comparison function that checks the equality of two objects. The expected test cases provide specific values and types for the input variables and the expected output variable right before the function's return.

In the first test case, the function should return specific values for variables like self_axes, other_axes, block.dtype, block, and block.mgr_locs. These values and types should be consistent with the input parameters and the logic of the function.

The buggy function needs to be corrected to produce the expected values and types of variables for each test case, ensuring that it accurately compares the equality of the given objects.
