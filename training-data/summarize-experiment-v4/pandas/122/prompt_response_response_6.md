Based on the provided information, the potential bug in the buggy function `equals` may be within the comparison of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The issue may be related to the incorrect comparison of blocks' equalities, which causes the method to return True when it should return False, as indicated by the failing test case and the corresponding error message.

To fix the bug, the developer may need to review the logic within the `equals` function, particularly the comparison of individual blocks in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists. It's important to ensure that the comparison accurately reflects the equality of the blocks, addressing any potential discrepancies in block locations or types.

The corrected code for the buggy function `equals` in the BlockManager class may be updated as follows:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining block dtype and mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By updating the comparison logic within the `equals` function and ensuring that the comparison accurately reflects the equality of the blocks, the corrected code aims to address the issue reported in the GitHub bug. This fix should enable the function to pass the failing test case and produce the expected output, resolving the reported bug in the GitHub issue.
