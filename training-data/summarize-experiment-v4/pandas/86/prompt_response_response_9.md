The potential error location within the buggy function lies in the block of code where "MultiIndex.from_arrays" is being used. This is likely causing the "KeyError: None" error message because it is expecting a valid value for the "columns" argument, and when it is passed as "None", it raises an error.

The bug's cause is that the "pivot" function is not handling the case when the "columns" argument is passed as "None" properly, and it is expecting a valid column name. This goes against the expected behavior as per the pandas documentation where "index" and "values" are optional, but "columns" is not.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that if "columns" is passed as "None", an appropriate error message is raised to indicate that "columns" is not optional.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot"], indents=1)
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if columns is None:  # Add a check for None columns
        raise ValueError("The 'columns' parameter is required and cannot be None.")
    
    if values is None:
        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.set_index(cols, append=append)
    else:
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        else:
            index = data[index]
        index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])

        if is_list_like(values) and not isinstance(values, tuple):
            # Exclude tuple because it is seen as a single column name
            indexed = data._constructor(
                data[values].values, index=index, columns=values
            )
        else:
            indexed = data._constructor_sliced(data[values].values, index=index)
    return indexed.unstack(columns)
```

With this correction, the "pivot" function will now raise a ValueError if the "columns" argument is passed as "None", addressing the issue reported on GitHub and preventing the "KeyError: None" error message from occurring. This should ensure that the function behaves as expected when called with "None" for the "columns" argument.
