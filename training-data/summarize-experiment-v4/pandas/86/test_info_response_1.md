In the failing test "test_pivot_columns_none_raise_error", an error occurred in the "pivot" function when calling "MultiIndex.from_arrays". This causes the error "pivot() missing 1 required argument: 'columns'". The error message "KeyError: None" suggests a problem with indexing or locating an item in the data frame. Therefore, further investigation should focus on that part of the "pivot" function related to the "index" and "columns" arguments, as well as the relationship between these and the way the "data" is indexed or selected.
