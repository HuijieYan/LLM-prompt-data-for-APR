The failing test case `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` in `test_datetime_index.py` produces an `AmbiguousTimeError` when down-sampling a DataFrame, due to a failure caused by a bug in the `_get_time_bins` function in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file, specifically at line 1425, which calls the `date_range` function in the `pandas/core/indexes/datetimes.py` file with a date that leads to an error that propagates up the stack.
