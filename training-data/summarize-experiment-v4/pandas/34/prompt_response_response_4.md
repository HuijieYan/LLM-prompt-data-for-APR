## Bug Cause

The bug is caused by the function `_get_time_bins` in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file. Specifically, it is throwing a `TypeError` if the input `ax` is not a `DatetimeIndex`. It then goes on to perform a series of operations including calling the functions `_get_timestamp_range_edges` and `_adjust_bin_edges` to create the time bins. There seems to be a discrepancy with the input `ax` type, possibly causing issues with the subsequent operations.

The failing test case `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` in `test_datetime_index.py` produces an `AmbiguousTimeError` when down-sampling a DataFrame, due to a failure caused by a bug in the `_get_time_bins` function in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file, specifically at line 1425, which calls the `date_range` function in the `pandas/core/indexes/datetimes.py` file with a date that leads to an error that propagates up the stack.

The output values and input parameters are relevant because they represent the input parameters and output variable values of the function `_get_time_bins`. These could be the cause of the bug and need to be analyzed for inconsistency.

The GitHub issue titled "groupby with daily frequency fails with AmbiguousTimeError on the clock change day in Cuba" is relevant, as it highlights the expected behavior and the actual problem with `pd.Grouper` not handling ambiguous timestamps correctly.

## Approach for Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function should be modified to handle all possible cases of input `ax` to ensure it is a `DatetimeIndex`. Additionally, the behavior of all subsequent operations should be verified and corrected if necessary to prevent any errors.

## Corrected Code

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    # Check if the input 'ax' is a DatetimeIndex
    if isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        if len(ax) == 0:
            binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
            return binner, [], labels

        first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
            ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
        )
        
        binner = labels = date_range(
            freq=self.freq,
            start=first,
            end=last,
            tz=ax.tz,
            name=ax.name,
            ambiguous="infer",
            nonexistent="shift_forward",
        )

        ax_values = ax.asi8
        binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

        bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

        if self.closed == "right":
            labels = binner
            if self.label == "right":
                labels = labels[1:]
        elif self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]

        if ax.hasnans:
            binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
            labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

        if len(bins) < len(labels):
            labels = labels[: len(bins)]

        return binner, bins, labels
    else:
        # If 'ax' is not a DatetimeIndex, raise a TypeError
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )
```

The corrected code includes a check to ensure that the input `ax` is a `DatetimeIndex` and raises a `TypeError` if it is not. Additionally, the subsequent operations are revised to handle ambiguous timestamps correctly and prevent the propagation of an error. This fix should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
