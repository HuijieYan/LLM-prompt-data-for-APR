Class docstring: The `TimeGrouper` class is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping. It has a method `_get_time_bins` that appears to be responsible for creating time bins based on the input DatetimeIndex.

`def _get_time_bins(self, ax)`: This function takes an input `ax` which is expected to be a DatetimeIndex. It then proceeds to perform operations on this input to create time bins.

`def _get_timestamp_range_edges(first, last, offset, closed='left', base=0)`: This function, located outside the class, is called by `_get_time_bins` to get the range edges for the time interval based on the input DatetimeIndex `ax`.

`def _adjust_bin_edges(self, binner, ax_values)`: Another function within the `TimeGrouper` class that is called by `_get_time_bins` to adjust the bin edges based on the input `binner` and `ax_values`.

In this scenario, the function `_get_time_bins` is throwing a TypeError if the input `ax` is not a DatetimeIndex. It then goes on to perform a series of operations including calling the functions `_get_timestamp_range_edges` and `_adjust_bin_edges` to create the time bins. There seems to be a discrepancy with the input `ax` type, possibly causing issues with the subsequent operations.
