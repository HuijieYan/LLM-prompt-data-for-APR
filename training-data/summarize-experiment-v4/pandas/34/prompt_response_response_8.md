## Bug Cause Analysis

The root cause of the bug is that the function `_get_time_bins` in the `TimeGrouper` class is throwing a `TypeError` when the input `ax` is not a `DatetimeIndex` as expected. This leads to subsequent operations on this input resulting in an AmbiguousTimeError during down-sampling a DataFrame, as described in the failing test case. The function is then trying to create time bins based on this erroneous input, leading to the observed failure.

The `_get_time_bins` function expects the input `ax` to be of type `DatetimeIndex`. The subsequent operations and function calls are dependent on this assumption. If the input `ax` is of a different type, it will lead to a `TypeError`, resulting in incorrect time bin creation and propagating up the stack as an AmbiguousTimeError.

## Bug Fix

To address the bug:
1. Add a check at the beginning of the `_get_time_bins` function to ensure that the input `ax` is of type `DatetimeIndex`. If it is not, raise a `TypeError` with a descriptive message.
2. Ensure that the subsequent operations and function calls in `_get_time_bins` are dependent on the input `ax` being a valid `DatetimeIndex`.

Based on the analysis and bug fix approach, the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function is as follows:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    # Proceed with the rest of the function assuming ax is a valid DatetimeIndex
    # ... (existing code for creating time bins)
```

With this fix, the `_get_time_bins` function now checks whether the input `ax` is a valid `DatetimeIndex` and raises a `TypeError` if it is not, thereby preventing subsequent operations from being performed on an invalid input. This should resolve the issue reported in the failing test case and the GitHub issue.
