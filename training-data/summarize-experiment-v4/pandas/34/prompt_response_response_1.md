## Bug Cause

The bug occurs when the input `ax` to the function `_get_time_bins` is not properly validated, leading to potential issues with subsequent operations. The input `ax` is expected to be a DatetimeIndex, but if it does not satisfy this condition, a TypeError is raised. This could potentially result in further issues downstream, such as the failing test case `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` producing an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

## Approach for Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, the validation of the input `ax` should be revised to ensure that it is a DatetimeIndex. Additionally, further error checks and handling of ambiguous time conditions should be implemented to address the failing test case and associated issues.

## The Corrected Code

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Validate that the timezone is None or not ambiguous
    ambiguous_time = ax.tz is not None and ax.tz._utc_transition_times is not None
    if ambiguous_time:
        # Handle ambiguous time by inferring the correct time offset
        ax = ax.tz_localize(None, ambiguous='NaT')
    
    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward" if ambiguous_time else "raise",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code, the input `ax` is properly validated to ensure that it is a DatetimeIndex. Additionally, handling for ambiguous time conditions is included to address the failing test case and potential `AmbiguousTimeError`. The `ambiguous_time` check ensures that if the timezone is ambiguous, the function will properly handle the condition by inferring the correct time offset. This approach should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
