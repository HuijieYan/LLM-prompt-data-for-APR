### Bug Cause Analysis:
The bug is occurring because the function `_get_time_bins` expects the input `ax` to be of type `DatetimeIndex`, but the provided input might not be of the correct type, which could lead to a series of operations on the input based on incorrect assumptions. This is detected via a `TypeError` check at the start of the function.

### Bug Fix Approaches:
1. Check if the input `ax` is indeed of type `DatetimeIndex` before continuing with the operations.
2. Ensure that the subsequent operations in the function, such as calling `_get_timestamp_range_edges` and `_adjust_bin_edges`, are handled correctly with the right types and values.
3. Validate the input parameters being used in the subsequent operations to prevent discrepancies.

### Corrected Code:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )
        
    # New: Validate the input parameters before performing operations
    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Rest of the existing code
    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
  
    # Rest of the existing code

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Rest of the existing code
```

By incorporating the suggestions from the bug cause analysis and adding a check for the input parameters, the corrected function is expected to handle the inputs accurately and resolve the issue.
