## Bug Location

The bug is located in the if-else construct at the end of the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function, specifically in the section where the mean and std values are subtracted and divided from the input array `x`.

## Bug Cause

The cause of the bug is that the code subtracts and divides the mean and std values from the input array `x` without checking the data type of `x`. This results in a type casting error, as the input array `x` could be of type 'int32' and the operation is trying to perform a subtraction with a float value.

## Approach to Fix the Bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the mean and std operations are performed using the same data type as the input array `x`. This can be achieved by converting the mean and std values to the same data type as `x` before performing the subtraction and division operations.

## Corrected Code

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
