The bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is caused by the attempt to perform a subtraction operation on specific dimensions of the input array with a float value, leading to a type casting error.

To fix the bug, we can modify the code to ensure that the input array and mean values have the same data type, and subsequently perform the operations. We also need to make sure that the output data type is consistent with the expected output.

Here's the corrected code for the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = x / 127.5 - 1.
        return x.astype('float32')

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = x / 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        x -= np.array(mean).reshape(1, -1, 1, 1).astype(x.dtype)
        if std is not None:
            x /= np.array(std).reshape(1, -1, 1, 1).astype(x.dtype)
    else:
        x -= np.array(mean).reshape((1, 1, 1, -1)).astype(x.dtype)
        if std is not None:
            x /= np.array(std).reshape((1, 1, 1, -1)).astype(x.dtype)
    return x
```

In the corrected code, we ensure that the input array `x`, mean values, and standard deviation values have the same data type, and subsequently perform the operations. Additionally, we cast the output to the 'float32' data type, ensuring consistency with the expected output.
