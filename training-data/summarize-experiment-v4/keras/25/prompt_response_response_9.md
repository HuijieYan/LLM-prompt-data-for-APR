## The corrected code for the buggy function

Here is the corrected code for the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    x = x.astype('float32')  # Convert input to float32
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
    elif mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        x = (x - mean) / std
    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, :, ::-1, ...]
            mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        else:
            # 'RGB'->'BGR'
            x = x[..., ::-1]
            mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        x -= mean

    return x
```

## Changes Made:
1. Added the line `x = x.astype('float32')` at the beginning of the function to ensure that the input array `x` is converted to float32 type for consistency in operations.
2. Introduced `elif` statements for `mode == 'torch'` to handle the scaling and normalization of the input array `x` based on the specified mode.
3. Adjusted the logic for handling the 'caffe' mode based on the data format, and updated the subtraction operation of `mean` from `x` accordingly.
4. Removed the separate handling of zero-centering and normalization for the 'caffe' mode, as it is now integrated with the mode-specific logic.
5. Removed the explicit division by `std` in the 'caffe' mode, as it was handled in the mode-specific logic for 'torch'.
   
With these changes, the corrected function should now properly preprocess the input array `x` based on the specified mode, data format, and other parameters, and return the preprocessed array with the expected values and types of variables. This should address the UFuncTypeError and ensure that the function passes the failing tests.
