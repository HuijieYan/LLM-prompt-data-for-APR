The failing test `test_preprocess_input` in `imagenet_utils_test.py` encountered an error at line 15 while checking `utils.preprocess_input(xint).shape == xint.shape`. This failure is occurring due to an 'UFuncTypeError' at line 82 within the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function in the `imagenet_utils.py` file while attempting to cast ufunc 'subtract' output from dtype('float64') to dtype('int32') with casting rule 'same_kind'. The stack trace indicates that this 'UFuncTypeError' originates from the line of code `x[..., 0] -= mean[0]`. The operation is trying to perform a subtraction on specific dimensions of the input array with a float value, leading to the type casting error.
