## The corrected code for the buggy function

```python
def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    if mode == 'tf':
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x /= 255.
        mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
        std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
        x = (x - mean) / std  # Updated line

    else:
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None

    if std is not None:  # Updated block
        x -= mean
        x /= std
    else:
        x -= mean

    return x
```

By making these changes, the function now performs the preprocessing according to the specified mode and data format, and returns the preprocessed array as expected. This should address the type casting error and ensure that the function passes the failing test and satisfies the expected input/output variable information.
