The failing test `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs` triggers an `AssertionError` when calling `keras.models.clone_model(model)` in the `tests/keras/test_sequential_model.py` file at line 360. This calls the `_clone_functional_model` function in `keras/models.py` at line 251 where the error occurs at line 166. Within the `_clone_functional_model` method, an `AssertionError` is triggered because the program could not compute the output of the `swap_layer_1` with a specific shape and data type. This error is likely related to the construction of the model during the cloning process.
