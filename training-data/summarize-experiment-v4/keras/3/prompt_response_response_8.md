## Bug's causes:

The bug causes the error to be triggered during the cloning process of a functional model with a layer that has more outputs without mask support. This is evident from the failing test `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs` and the corresponding error message that indicates a failure to compute the output tensor.

The issue on GitHub further confirms that the error occurs when using a functional model with a layer which has more outputs without mask support. The problem lies in the fact that `layer.compute_mask` will always return `None` since `Lambda` doesn't support using masks. The assertion error is triggered in the `_clone_functional_model` function when it tries to compute the output tensor with a specific shape and data type.

## Fixing the bug:

The bug can be fixed by modifying the code to handle layers with more outputs without mask support. One approach to resolve the issue is by checking for the presence of masks before attempting to use them. If the layer doesn't support masks, the code should handle this case appropriately.

Below is the corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function.

```python
# Corrected code for the buggy function
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # existing code...

    # Iterate over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # existing code...

            # Call layer.
            if node.arguments:
                kwargs = node.arguments
            else:
                kwargs = {}

            # Handle the case where the layer does not support masks
            if len(computed_data) == 1:
                computed_tensor, computed_mask = computed_data[0]
                if has_arg(layer.call, "mask"):
                    if "mask" not in kwargs:
                        kwargs["mask"] = computed_mask
                    output_tensors = to_list(layer(computed_tensor, **kwargs))
                else:
                    output_tensors = to_list(layer(computed_tensor, **kwargs))
            else:
                computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]
                computed_masks = [x[1] for x in computed_data]
                if has_arg(layer.call, "mask"):
                    if "mask" not in kwargs:
                        kwargs["mask"] = computed_masks
                    output_tensors = to_list(layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))
                else:
                    output_tensors = to_list(layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))

            # Update tensor_map.
            for x, y in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors):
                tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, "Could not compute output " + str(x)
        tensor, _ = tensor_map[x]
        output_tensors.append(tensor)
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

The corrected code includes the handling of layer output masks and adjusts the logic to properly handle cases where the layer does not support masks.

This fix ensures that the `_clone_functional_model` function can handle layers with more outputs without mask support, thereby resolving the GitHub issue and passing the failing test.
