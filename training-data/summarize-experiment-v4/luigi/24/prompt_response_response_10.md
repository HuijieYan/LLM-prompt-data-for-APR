## Bug Cause

The bug seems to be in the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]`. The usage of `+=` is causing the issue by concatenating the value to the command list, instead of adding the key-value pair to the list, resulting in an incorrect command list being generated.


## Approach to Fix the Bug

To fix the bug, we need to modify the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]` to `command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, value)]` to correctly add the key-value pair to the command list.


## The corrected code

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
By making this change, the bug in the `_dict_arg` function should be fixed, and it should now generate the correct command list based on the input dictionary.
