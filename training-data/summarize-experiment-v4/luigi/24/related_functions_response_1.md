Class docstring: The `SparkSubmitTask` class is a template for running a Spark job and supports running jobs on various Spark environments.

`def name(self)`: This function is from the same file but is not the same class, and its interaction with the buggy function is not clear. It is called by the buggy function `def _dict_arg`.

`def _dict_arg(self, name, value)`: This function seems to take a name and value as parameters and is responsible for creating a command list based on the given value. It appears to handle dictionary values and generate a command list based on the key-value pairs provided in the dictionary. There is a condition that checks if the value is a dictionary, and then it iterates over the items in the dictionary to create the command list. There is a possible issue in the way the command list is being generated or handled within this function.
