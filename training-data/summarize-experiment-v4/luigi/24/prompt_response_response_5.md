Approach to fix the bug:
The issue is with the way the command list is being generated within the `_dict_arg` function. The value for the key-value pairs is not being added in the correct format. To fix this, we need to modify the code to correctly construct the command list by concatenating the key and value with an equals sign ('=').

Here is the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append("{0}={1}".format(prop, val))
    return command
```

With this corrected code, the `_dict_arg` function should now correctly generate the command list as expected for the given input cases.
