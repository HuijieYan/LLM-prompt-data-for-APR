## Bug Cause

The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the concatenation of the `name` and `"{0}={1}"` formatted string for each key-value pair in the dictionary. The current implementation results in the `=` as a literal string being part of the list into which the key-value pair is added, which is unnecessary. Additionally, the `prop` variable is being overwritten in the for loop and it's also adding double quotes around the key-value pair, which is not desired.

## Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, the `=` should be used as the separator for the key-value pair, the `prop` and `value` variable need to be chosen distinct names for the loop, and the unnecessary double quotes should be removed from the formatted strings appended to the command list.

## The corrected code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for key, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(key, val)]
    return command
```
