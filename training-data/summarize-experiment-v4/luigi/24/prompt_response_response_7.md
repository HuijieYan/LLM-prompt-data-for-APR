The potential error location within the buggy function is the way the command list is generated. The current implementation concatenates strings and includes an extra pair of quotes around the key-value pair when it is added to the command list.

Approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Removing the extra quotes from the string concatenation for the key-value pair.
2. Directly adding the key and value pair to the command list without additional formatting.

Here is the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{}={}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By removing the extra quotes and directly formatting the key-value pair in the command list, the corrected function satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided.
