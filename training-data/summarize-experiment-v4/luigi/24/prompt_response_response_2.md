The issue with the buggy function `_dict_arg` is that it's adding extra quotes around the key-value pairs when creating the command list. As a result, the output is not being generated as expected.

To fix this issue, the extra quotes around the key-value pairs should be removed.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, "{0}={1}".format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this fix, the function should now produce the expected output for both input cases:
1. When the input parameters are `value={'Prop': 'Value'}` and `name='--conf'`, the function should return `['--conf', 'Prop=Value']`.
2. When the input parameters are `value={'prop1': 'val1'}` and `name='--conf'`, the function should return `['--conf', 'prop1=val1']`.
