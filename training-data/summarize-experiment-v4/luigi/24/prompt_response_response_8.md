## The bug's cause:

The bug is caused by the line `command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]` in the `_dict_arg` function. This line is creating a list with `name` and formatted string `"prop=value"`, which is then added to the `command` list. This is resulting in a redundant entry for `name` in the command list, leading to the unexpected output.

## Suggestions for fixing the bug:

To fix the bug, we need to remove the unnecessary `name` entries from the `command` list and only include the formatted key-value pair strings.

## The corrected code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append('{0}={1}'.format(prop, val))
    return [name] + command
```

With this corrected code, the function will now correctly build the command list, eliminating the redundant entries for `name`, thus passing the failing tests and producing the expected output.
