The buggy function takes in a name and a value, and if the value is a dictionary, it creates a command list based on the key-value pairs in the dictionary. However, the function currently has a bug and is not producing the expected output.

Case 1: When the input parameters are `value={'Prop': 'Value'}` and `name='--conf'`, the function should return `['--conf', '"Prop=Value"']`. The current buggy function is not producing the expected output, and the variables `value` and `prop` are not being assigned the expected values and types.

Case 2: When the input parameters are `value={'prop1': 'val1'}` and `name='--conf'`, the function should return `['--conf', '"prop1=val1"']`. The current buggy function is also not producing the expected output, and the variables `value` and `prop` are not being assigned the expected values and types.

In summary, the current buggy function is not working as expected for both input cases. The value and type of variables right before the function return are not as expected, and the function needs to be corrected to produce the expected output for these input cases.
