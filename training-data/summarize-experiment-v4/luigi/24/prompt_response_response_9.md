### Bug Cause:

The bug is caused by the incorrect formatting of the dictionary key-value pairs when creating the command list. The function incorrectly adds an extra set of double quotes around the key-value pairs.

### Approach to Fix:

To fix this bug, we need to remove the extra double quotes around the key-value pairs and ensure that the command list is generated in the correct format.

### Corrected Code:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '{0}={1}'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
The corrected code removes the extra double quotes around the key-value pairs and generates the command list in the correct format. This should resolve the bug and produce the expected output for the given input cases.
