## Bug Cause

The bug is caused by the way the command list is being generated in the `_dict_arg` function. The use of double quotes in generating the command list seems to be causing the unexpected output, which includes the keys and values in the dictionary being surrounded by double quotes.

## Approach to Fix the Bug

To fix the bug, the function should generate the command list without surrounding the keys and values in the dictionary with double quotes. The function should iterate over the dictionary and create the command list directly without adding additional characters such as double quotes.

## The corrected code for the buggy function

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append(prop + "=" + value)
    return command
```

By removing the double quotes and modifying the way the command list is being generated within the loop, the corrected function should now produce the expected output:

Case 1: When the input parameters are `value={'Prop': 'Value'}` and `name='--conf'`, the function should return `['--conf', 'Prop=Value']`.

Case 2: When the input parameters are `value={'prop1': 'val1'}` and `name='--conf'`, the function should return `['--conf', 'prop1=val1']`.

With these changes, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
