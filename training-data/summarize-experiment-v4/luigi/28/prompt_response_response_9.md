The issue in the `table_exists` function is that it does not handle the case when the table name contains uppercase letters, leading to a mismatch in comparison and returning False even when the table exists. This issue is reported on GitHub with issue IDs #896 and #897.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison between the table name and the stdout to be case insensitive by converting both to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this corrected code, the `table_exists` function will correctly handle the case where the table name contains uppercase letters and return the expected results for the given input parameters, thereby fixing the issue reported in GitHub.
