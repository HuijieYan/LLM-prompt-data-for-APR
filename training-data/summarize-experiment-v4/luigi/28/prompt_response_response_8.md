The bug in the `table_exists` function is that it does not account for case sensitivity when comparing the table names. The assumption is that the table name will always be in lowercase, which leads to incorrect comparisons when the actual table name includes uppercase letters.

A potential approach to fix this bug is to convert both the table name and the contents of `stdout` to lowercase before making the comparison. This will ensure that the function is case insensitive when checking for the existence of a table.

Here is the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

With this correction, the function will now perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the contents of `stdout`, resolving the issue of failing test cases due to case sensitivity when checking for table existence.
