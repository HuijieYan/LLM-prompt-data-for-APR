The bug here is that the table_exists function does not take into account case sensitivity, which leads to a mismatch in comparisons and incorrect return values. The function should return True when checking for a table's existence, regardless of the case of the provided table name.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to make the comparison case-insensitive. We can achieve this by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before performing the comparison.

Here's the corrected code for the table_exists function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

The updated function converts both the table name and the stdout to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparing them. This change ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, which resolves the issue posted in GitHub and covers for the failing test cases.
