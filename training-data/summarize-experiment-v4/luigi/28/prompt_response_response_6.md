The bug occurs in the table_exists function of the HiveCommandClient class, where it doesn't handle case-insensitivity when checking for table existence. The failing test cases and the GitHub issue indicate that the function should be case insensitive when comparing the table name with the stdout. The function currently returns False in these cases due to the case sensitivity mismatch. 

To fix the bug, update the table_exists function to compare the table name case insensitively with the stdout. This fix will address the failing test cases and the GitHub issue by making the table existence check case insensitive.

Here's the corrected code for the table_exists function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition {self.partition_spec(partition)}")
        
        return bool(stdout)
```
The update on line 3 converts both the table name and the stdout to lowercase for case-insensitive comparison. We also modified the query construction on line 7 to use f-string formatting for improved readability.

With this change, the table_exists function should now correctly handle case-insensitive table existence checks in the specified database and return the expected output values. This addresses the failing test cases and GitHub issues related to case sensitivity in table detection.
