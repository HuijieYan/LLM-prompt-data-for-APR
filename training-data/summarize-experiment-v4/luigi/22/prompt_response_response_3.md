The bug in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is that the `last_active` attribute is not properly initialized when the `last_active` parameter is provided.

To fix the bug, we need to adjust the initialization of the `last_active` attribute in the `__init__` method to properly handle the optional `last_active` parameter.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = None
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` attribute is properly initialized based on the value of the `last_active` parameter, addressing the `TypeError` that was observed in the failing test case. This should make the program pass the failing test, and the function now satisfies the expected input/output variable information.
