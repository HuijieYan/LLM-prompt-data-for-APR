The bug in the buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter is not properly set to the `self.last_active` attribute when it is provided. This results in the `self.last_active` defaulting to `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when it is later used in the code.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `__init__` function to properly assign the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` attribute.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this fix, if the `last_active` parameter is provided, it will be assigned to `self.last_active`. Otherwise, the current time in seconds since the epoch will be assigned to `self.last_active` as a default value. This ensures that the `self.last_active` attribute is always properly initialized.
