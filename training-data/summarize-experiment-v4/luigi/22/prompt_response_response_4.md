The potential error location within the buggy function is the `last_active=None` parameter.

The bug's cause is that the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default in the `__init__` method, but it should be properly initialized to the provided value if one is provided.

To fix the bug, the `last_active` parameter should be properly assigned to `self.last_active` within the `__init__` method.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the program should pass the failing test, and the function now correctly initializes the `self.last_active` attribute based on the provided input instead of defaulting to `None`.
