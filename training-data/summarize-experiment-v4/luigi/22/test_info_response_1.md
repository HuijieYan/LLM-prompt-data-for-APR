The failing test case `test_worker_prune_after_init` from `scheduler_test.py` tried to invoke the `prune` method of the `Worker` class with a custom configuration (`TmpCfg`) containing a `worker_disconnect_delay` attribute set to 10. The error message shows a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int'`. The error occurred at line 245 in the `luigi/scheduler.py` file where the `prune` method resides. The issue is due to the addition operation involving `NoneType` and `int`, suggesting that the `self.last_active` attribute is not properly initialized in the `__init__` method which takes an optional argument.
