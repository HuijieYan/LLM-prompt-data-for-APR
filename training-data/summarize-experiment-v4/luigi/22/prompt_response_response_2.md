The bug in the provided `__init__` function is that it incorrectly initializes `self.last_active` with the input parameter `last_active` even if it's None. This causes a `TypeError` when the `prune` method is called and tries to perform a addition operation involving `NoneType` and `int`. 

To fix the bug, we need to check if the `last_active` input parameter is None and then initialize `self.last_active` accordingly in the `__init__` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = None
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

This updated code checks if the `last_active` input parameter is None and then initializes `self.last_active` accordingly. This ensures that there won't be a `TypeError` when performing operations involving `self.last_active`.
