The bug in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is that the `last_active` parameter is not being properly assigned to the `self.last_active` attribute.

To fix this bug:
1. Update the `__init__` method to correctly assign the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` attribute.
2. If `last_active` is not provided, set the `self.last_active` to None.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else None  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `last_active` parameter will be properly assigned to the `self.last_active` attribute, and if the `last_active` parameter is not provided, `self.last_active` will be set to None by default. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the `Worker` object is properly initialized with the expected attributes and values.
