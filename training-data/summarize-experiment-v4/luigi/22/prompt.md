## The source code of the buggy function

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
import time
```

The buggy function is under file: `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/bgp_envs_local/repos/luigi_22/luigi/scheduler.py`

Here is the buggy function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}

```


## Summary of Related Functions

Class docstring: This class is a structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references. The related functions or attributes `worker_id`, `last_active`, `reference`, `started`, `tasks`, and `info` likely play a role in maintaining and tracking worker activity.

`def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None)`: This function is the constructor for the `Worker` class which takes in the worker_id and an optional last_active parameter. It initializes several attributes such as `id`, `reference`, `last_active`, `started`, `tasks`, and `info` which are likely used to track and maintain the worker's status and activity.

`self.started = time.time()`: This line likely sets the `started` attribute to the current time in seconds since the epoch when the `Worker` object is created.

`self.tasks = set()`: This line likely initializes the `tasks` attribute as a set to store task objects related to the worker.

`self.info = {}`: This line initializes an empty dictionary for storing additional information about the worker.

Overall, the `__init__` function seems to be responsible for initializing and setting up the `Worker` object with relevant attributes and references.


## Summary of the test cases and error messages

The failing test case `test_worker_prune_after_init` from `scheduler_test.py` tried to invoke the `prune` method of the `Worker` class with a custom configuration (`TmpCfg`) containing a `worker_disconnect_delay` attribute set to 10. The error message shows a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int'`. The error occurred at line 245 in the `luigi/scheduler.py` file where the `prune` method resides. The issue is due to the addition operation involving `NoneType` and `int`, suggesting that the `self.last_active` attribute is not properly initialized in the `__init__` method which takes an optional argument.


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The relevant input/output values are
- worker_id (value: 123, type: int)
- last_active (value: 1706548223.648739, type: float)
- self.last_active (value: 1706548223.648739, type: float)
The rational is that the last_active input parameter seems to be correctly assigned to self.last_active, and there are no visible issues with the other variables that could cause a bug.


## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

Case 1: Given the input parameter `worker_id=123`, the function should initialize the following variables:
- self.id = 123 (int)
- self.reference = None (none)
- self.last_active = None (none)
- self.started = 1706548222.8972173 (float)
- self.tasks = set() (set)
- self.info = {} (dict)
