The bug in the provided function is that the `last_active` parameter is not properly assigned to `self.last_active` in the `__init__` method. This results in the `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int'` error when the `prune` method is called.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method and assign its value to `self.last_active` if it is not `None`. Otherwise, we should initialize `self.last_active` with a default value.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` parameter is properly handled in the `__init__` method, and the `self.last_active` attribute will be assigned either the provided value or the current time if no value is provided. This should resolve the `TypeError` and ensure that the function behaves as expected.
