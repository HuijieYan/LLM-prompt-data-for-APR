The issue in the buggy function is that the `last_active` parameter is not being properly assigned to the `self.last_active` attribute, leading to a `TypeError` when the `prune` method is invoked.

To fix the bug, simply modify the `__init__` method to properly assign the `last_active` parameter to the `self.last_active` attribute.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
