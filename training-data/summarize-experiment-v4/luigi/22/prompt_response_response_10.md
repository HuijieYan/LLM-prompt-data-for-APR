## Bug's Cause

The bug is caused by the optional `last_active` parameter not being properly initialized in the `__init__` method. The error occurs when the `prune` method tries to add the `worker_disconnect_delay` value to `self.last_active`, which is initialized as `None`. This results in a `TypeError` since adding an integer to `None` is unsupported.


## Potential Error Location

The potential error location is in the `__init__` method where the `last_active` parameter is assigned to `self.last_active`.


## Approaches for Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, the `__init__` method needs to properly handle the `last_active` parameter. If the `last_active` parameter is not provided, it should default to `None`.


## The corrected code for the buggy function

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = None
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
