The relevant input/output values are
- worker_id (value: 123, type: int)
- last_active (value: 1706548223.648739, type: float)
- self.last_active (value: 1706548223.648739, type: float)
The rational is that the last_active input parameter seems to be correctly assigned to self.last_active, and there are no visible issues with the other variables that could cause a bug.
