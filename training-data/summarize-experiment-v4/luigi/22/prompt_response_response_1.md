## Bug Cause
The bug is caused by the `last_active` attribute not being properly initialized with the given `last_active` parameter when the `__init__` method is called with a specific `last_active` value. This leads to the `last_active` variable defaulting to `None`, causing issues when this value is used in other parts of the code, such as during the addition operation in the `prune` method.

## Approach for Fixing the Bug
We need to ensure that the `last_active` attribute is properly initialized with the given `last_active` parameter when the `__init__` method is called, and should not default to `None` when a specific value is provided.

## The Corrected Buggy Function
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By using this corrected function, the `last_active` attribute will be properly initialized with the given value when provided, and will default to the current time when no specific value is given. This should resolve the bug and ensure that the `last_active` attribute is always initialized correctly.
