Class docstring: This class is a structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references. The related functions or attributes `worker_id`, `last_active`, `reference`, `started`, `tasks`, and `info` likely play a role in maintaining and tracking worker activity.

`def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None)`: This function is the constructor for the `Worker` class which takes in the worker_id and an optional last_active parameter. It initializes several attributes such as `id`, `reference`, `last_active`, `started`, `tasks`, and `info` which are likely used to track and maintain the worker's status and activity.

`self.started = time.time()`: This line likely sets the `started` attribute to the current time in seconds since the epoch when the `Worker` object is created.

`self.tasks = set()`: This line likely initializes the `tasks` attribute as a set to store task objects related to the worker.

`self.info = {}`: This line initializes an empty dictionary for storing additional information about the worker.

Overall, the `__init__` function seems to be responsible for initializing and setting up the `Worker` object with relevant attributes and references.
