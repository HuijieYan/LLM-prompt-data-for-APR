Your task is to assist a developer in analyzing runtime information of a buggy program. You will receive the source code of the function suspected to contain the bug, along with the values it produces. These values include the input parameters (with their values and types) and the output values and types of relevant variables at the function's return. If an input parameter is not reflected in the output, it is assumed to remain unchanged. Your role is to summary the relevant input/output values and provide a rational for your choice by following the example below.


## Example Source Code:
```python
def factorial(n):
    if n == 0:
        result = 0
    else:
        result = n * factorial(n - 1)
    return result
```

## Example Runtime Information:

### Case 1
- Input parameters: n (value: 0, type: int)
- Output: result (value: 0, type: int)

### Case 2
- Input parameters: n (value: 3, type: int)
- Output: result (value: 6, type: int)


## Example Summary:

The relevant input/output values are
- Input parameters: n (value: 0, type: int)
- Output: result (value: 0, type: int)
Rational: for this input, the function computes the factorial of 0, which should be 1, and not 0.

## The source code of the buggy function

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}

```

## Runtime values and types of variables inside the buggy function
Each case below includes input parameter values and types, and the values and types of relevant variables at the function's return, derived from executing failing tests. If an input parameter is not reflected in the output, it is assumed to remain unchanged. Note that some of these values at the function's return might be incorrect. Analyze these cases to identify why the tests are failing to effectively fix the bug.

### Case 1
#### Runtime values and types of the input parameters of the buggy function
worker_id, value: `123`, type: `int`

last_active, value: `1706548223.648739`, type: `float`

#### Runtime values and types of variables right before the buggy function's return
self.id, value: `123`, type: `int`

self.last_active, value: `1706548223.648739`, type: `float`

self.started, value: `1706548223.6552343`, type: `float`

self.tasks, value: `set()`, type: `set`

self.info, value: `{}`, type: `dict`

## Summary:

[Your summary here. You need to only copy runtime input/output values that are likely relevant to the bug, and provide a concise rational for your choice.]
