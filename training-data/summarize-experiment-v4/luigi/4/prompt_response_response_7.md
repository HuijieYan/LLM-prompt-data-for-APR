## Bug Cause

The bug is caused by the `copy` function failing to handle the case where the `columns` attribute is None, resulting in a TypeError when attempting to access its length. This leads to a failure when trying to execute the SQL COPY command with an empty `colnames` variable.

## Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, the `copy` function needs to handle the scenario where `self.columns` is None and avoid attempting to access its length in that case. This can be achieved by adding a simple check before attempting to construct `colnames` from the `self.columns` attribute.

## Corrected Code

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)

    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Add a check for None before accessing length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the `copy` function will first check whether `self.columns` is not None before building the `colnames` string, preventing the TypeError when the attribute is None. This corrected code satisfies the failing test and resolves the issue posted in the GitHub report.
