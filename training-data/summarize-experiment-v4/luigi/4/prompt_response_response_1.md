## Bug's Cause

The bug causes an error due to the 'columns' variable being set to None, which results in a TypeError. This occurs when the 'columns' attribute is not provided, and the program does not handle the None type for 'columns' within the 'copy' function.

## Approach for Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, the 'copy' function should be modified to handle the case when 'columns' is None and prevent the TypeError from occurring. This can be achieved by checking if 'columns' is not None before attempting to access its length.

## The Corrected Code

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` before accessing the 'columns' attribute, we ensure that the program will only attempt to access the length of 'columns' if it is not None. This modification prevents the TypeError from occurring and allows the 'copy' function to handle the case where 'columns' is not provided.
