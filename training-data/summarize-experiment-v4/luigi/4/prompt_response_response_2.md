Based on the information provided, it appears that the issue lies with the 'colnames' variable being empty when the 'columns' attribute is not provided. To fix this bug, we need to modify the conditional statement for the 'colnames' variable to handle the case when 'columns' is not provided.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if 'columns' is not None before processing
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the 'colnames' variable is only constructed when 'columns' is not None and contains elements, thereby avoiding the TypeError related to the 'NoneType' object not having length.

This correction should resolve the issue as reported in the GitHub bug and ensure that the program passes the failing test.
