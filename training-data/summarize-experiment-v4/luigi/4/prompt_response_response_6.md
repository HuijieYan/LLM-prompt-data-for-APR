Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check if the 'columns' variable is None before attempting to access its length.
2. If 'columns' is None, handle it appropriately to prevent the TypeError.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, the code ensures that the 'columns' variable is not None before attempting to access its length. This will prevent the TypeError from occurring when 'columns' is None.
