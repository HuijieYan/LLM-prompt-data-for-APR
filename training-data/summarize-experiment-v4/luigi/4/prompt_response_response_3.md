## Bug's Cause

The cause of the bug is that the `columns` variable is not being handled properly in the `copy` function. When `self.columns` is set to `None`, the code attempts to retrieve the length of `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`. The source of the bug is the handling of the `columns` variable, where it is not being checked for being `None` before attempting to access its length. This oversight causes the failure of the Redshift COPY operation when `columns` is not provided.

## Approach for Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, it is necessary to modify the code to handle the case where the `columns` variable is `None`. The `colnames` variable needs to be defined conditionally based on the existence and length of the `self.columns` list.

### Updated `copy` Function
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from S3 into Redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''

    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
    COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
    CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
    {options}
    ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By incorporating the conditional check for the existence and length of `self.columns`, the bug can be fixed and the Redshift COPY operation can handle the case where `columns` is not provided.

This approach ensures that `colnames` is only defined when `self.columns` is not `None`, avoiding the `TypeError` caused by accessing the length of `None`.

### GitHub Issue Resolution

The suggested fix aligns with the proposed solution in the GitHub issue. It addresses the root cause by introducing conditional handling of `self.columns` to prevent the `TypeError`. The updated code resolves the issue reported in the GitHub thread and ensures that the Redshift COPY operation functions correctly even when `columns` are not provided.

By incorporating this fix, the failing test "test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns" should pass, and the bug reported in the GitHub issue should be resolved.
