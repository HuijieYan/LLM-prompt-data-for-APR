## Bug's Cause Elucidation

The bug is caused by the `copy` function failing when the `self.columns` variable is set to None. This causes a TypeError because the program tries to access the length of a NoneType object. This issue was identified in the failing test case "test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns" where the error occurred on line 356 of the redshift.py file. The line `colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])` is likely the source of the error because it tries to iterate through `self.columns` when it's None.

The GitHub issue titled "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided" explains that the root cause is related to the inability to handle the case where `self.columns` is None.

## Suggested Approaches for Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, the `copy` function needs to be modified to handle the case when `self.columns` is None, and avoid attempting to access the length of a NoneType object. One possible solution suggested in the GitHub issue is to change the line `if len(self.columns) > 0:` to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to explicitly check if `self.columns` is not None before trying to access its length.

## Corrected Code

Here is the corrected version of the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In this corrected code, the problematic line that caused the TypeError has been modified to explicitly check if `self.columns` is not None before proceeding to access its length. This fix should address the bug and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
