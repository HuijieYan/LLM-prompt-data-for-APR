## Bug's Cause

The cause of the bug is as follows:
- The `columns` variable is expected to contain a list of column names, but it is not being checked for `None` before attempting to access its length using `len()`. As a result, when `columns` is `None`, a `TypeError` is raised, leading to the failure of the Redshift COPY operation.

## Approaches for Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, the `columns` variable needs to be checked for `None` before attempting to access its length. If `columns` is `None`, it should be handled appropriately without causing a `TypeError`. Additionally, the `colnames` variable may need to be assigned a default value if `columns` is empty to ensure the successful execution of the COPY command.

## Corrected Code

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected code, we added a check for `self.columns` before attempting to access its length. If `self.columns` is not `None`, then the `colnames` variable is constructed as before. This change ensures that the `TypeError` due to accessing the length of a `NoneType` object is avoided.

This corrected code should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
