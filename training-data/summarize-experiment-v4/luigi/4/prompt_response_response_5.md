The bug in the `copy` function of the `S3CopyToTable` class is related to the handling of the `columns` variable. When the `columns` attribute is not provided, it is set to `None`, leading to a `TypeError` when trying to access its length in the `copy` function. The failing test "test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns" triggers this error message:

```
TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()
```

In the `copy` function, the `columns` variable is used to construct the column names for the `COPY` command. Since it can be `None`, this results in an empty string for `colnames`, causing the `COPY` command to malfunction.

To fix the bug, the `copy` function must be modified to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` properly. One approach is to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before constructing `colnames`.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if self.columns is not None before constructing colnames
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this modification, the program will pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub regarding the failure of `COPY` jobs when `columns` are not provided.
