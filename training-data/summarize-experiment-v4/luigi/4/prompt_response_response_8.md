## Bug Cause

The bug is caused by the `colnames` variable being empty due to the `self.columns` variable being None. This causes the `COPY` command to fail due to the TypeError related to the 'NoneType' object not having length.

## Approach for Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, we need to handle the case where `self.columns` is None and set `colnames` to an empty string in that scenario. This can prevent the TypeError from occurring.

## Corrected Code

Here is the corrected code for the `copy` function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this correction, the code will check if `self.columns` is not None before constructing the `colnames` variable, preventing the TypeError from occurring. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
