The failing tests of the `test_python_list_param_as_form()`, `test_python_set_param_as_form()`, and `test_python_tuple_param_as_form()` return the same error message, stating that the assertion of the `response.status_code` to be `200` fails, with the received status code being `422`. The deep cause of the bug might be in the function `request_body_to_args`. The failure seems to happen when trying to validate and process the request bodies. A list of errors and values are returned.
