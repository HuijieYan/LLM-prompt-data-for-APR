## Identified Bug

The bug in the `request_body_to_args` function seems to be related to the processing of repeated keys in the `received_body` FormData. The function does not handle the case where the same key is repeated in the FormData, leading to incorrect validation and processing of the data.

## Bug Cause

The cause of the bug is the mishandling of repeated keys in the `received_body` FormData. The function assumes that the key-value pairs in the FormData are unique, leading to incorrect validation and processing of the data. This issue is consistent with the GitHub issue that requests support for repeated key=value pairs in form data.

## Approach to Fix the Bug

To fix the bug, the function `request_body_to_args` needs to be modified to handle repeated keys in the `received_body` FormData. It should collect repeated keys and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation occurs.

## Correction of the Buggy Function

Below is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function, which includes handling repeated keys in the `received_body` FormData:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        field = required_params[0]
        field_info = get_field_info(field)
        embed = getattr(field_info, "embed", None)
        if len(required_params) == 1 and not embed:
            received_values = received_body.getlist(field.alias) if hasattr(received_body, 'getlist') else received_body
            received_body = {field.alias: received_values}
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            elif (
                field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
            ):
                awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, the function now checks if the received body is a FormData and collects repeated keys using the `getlist` method. This ensures that repeated keys are properly handled and assigned as lists before validation occurs.

By making these changes, the function now correctly handles repeated keys in the `received_body` FormData and should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
