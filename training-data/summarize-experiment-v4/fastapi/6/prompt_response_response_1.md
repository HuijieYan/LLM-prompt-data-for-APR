## Bugs in the Buggy Function
The bug is likely located within the logic for processing the received_body data, particularly when handling multiple items with the same key in the FormData. This is evident from the failing tests `test_python_list_param_as_form()`, `test_python_set_param_as_form()`, and `test_python_tuple_param_as_form()` returning a 422 status code instead of the expected 200 status code.

The cause of the bug is due to the function not appropriately handling cases where there are multiple items with the same key in the received_body FormData. It fails to process and validate these multiple items correctly, leading to the incorrect error response and failing tests.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the logic for processing FormData to correctly handle cases where there are multiple items with the same key.
2. Ensure that the function appropriately validates and processes each item in the FormData, especially when dealing with sequence shapes (list, set, tuple).

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)  # Use getlist to handle multiple items with the same key in FormData
            if len(value) == 0 and field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(
                            MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias), config=BaseConfig
                        )
                    )
            else:
                values[field.name] = value

    return values, errors
```

With the updated code, the function now correctly handles cases where there are multiple items with the same key in the received_body FormData. It uses the `getlist()` method to retrieve all items with the same key and processes them accordingly. This should resolve the failing tests and the GitHub issue related to supporting repeated key=value in form data.
