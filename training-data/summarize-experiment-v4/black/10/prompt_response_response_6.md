Based on the comprehensive analysis provided, it appears that the bug is caused by incorrect handling of indentation and comments in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. The issue in the GitHub report indicates a problem with the function's behavior related to tabulated comments after a dedent. The function is expected to correctly process the prefix string based on the column parameter, yet it yields unexpected outputs, leading to the mentioned formatting issue.

To address the bug, it is crucial to trace the code's behavior for handling indentation, comments, and newline characters. Correcting the logic within the function and ensuring accurate column tracking are key aspects for resolving this issue.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += (column - (current_column % column))
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The proposed adjustments aim to accurately handle the prefix string's indentation and accommodate comments after dedent as requested in the GitHub issue. The updates include correcting the logic associated with calculating `current_column` when encountering a tab character (`\t`) and immediately returning the results when the expected conditions are met. Additionally, the use of `prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]` ensures proper retrieval of the remaining portion of the prefix string.

By applying these modifications, the corrected `_partially_consume_prefix` function resolves the bug, aligning with the expected behavior and addressing the reported formatting issue on the GitHub platform.
