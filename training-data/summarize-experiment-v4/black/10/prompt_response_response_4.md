## Bug Cause

The bug is caused by incorrect handling of indentation and comments in the `_partially_consume_prefix` method, resulting in mismatches between expected and actual results of the test.

## Bug Location
The potential error location within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is in the logic for handling characters when waiting for a newline. The incorrect manipulation of `current_column` and `wait_for_nl` leads to discrepancies in the final output.

## Approaches for Fixing the Bug
1. Evaluate the conditional statements related to whitespace and newline characters to ensure correct tracking of column position and line consumption.
2. Implement a method that accurately handles indentation and comment alignment, specifically when processing whitespace characters and newline tokens.

## Corrected Code
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With the corrected logic, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should accurately handle indentation and comment alignment, resolving the issues related to the mismatch between expected and actual results.
