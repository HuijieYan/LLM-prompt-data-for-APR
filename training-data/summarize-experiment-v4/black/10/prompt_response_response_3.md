## Bug cause
The bug arises from the mishandling of indentation and comments after a dedent in the prefix string within the `_partially_consume_prefix` method. This causes the incorrect adjustment of the current line and other variables, leading to unexpected outputs.

## Approaches for fixing the bug
1. Revise the logic for processing indentation, newlines, and whitespace characters within the `_partially_consume_prefix` method to ensure proper detection and handling of comments after a dedent.
2. Verify the treatment of tabulated comments and dedents to correct any deviations from the expected behavior.
3. Consider incorporating specific tests or conditions to address scenarios involving tabulated comments and indentation-related edge cases.

## Corrected code

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if current_column < column:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char in [' ', '\t']:
                current_column += 1 if char == ' ' else 4
            elif char == '\n':
                wait_for_nl = True if current_column < column else False
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` method includes a revised logic and additional conditions to ensure the proper handling of indentation, newlines, and comments after a dedent. The adjustments aim to address the issues related to tabulated comments and indentation, which were causing discrepancies in the expected and actual results.
