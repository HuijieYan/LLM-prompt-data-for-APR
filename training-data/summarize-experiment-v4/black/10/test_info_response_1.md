The failing test "test_comment_indentation" in the file "test_black.py" encounters an AssertionError in the "assertFormatEqual" method at line 156. The error occurs when comparing the expected and actual contents, where the expected string is not equal to the actual string. The stack trace indicates that the discrepancy arises from the formatting of the code involving indentation and comments. The issue is likely related to the handling of indentation and comments in the "_partially_consume_prefix" method, which mismatches the expected and actual results of the test.
