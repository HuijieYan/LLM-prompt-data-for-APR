The potential error within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is in its logic for handling whitespace characters and newline characters. This could lead to issues when processing indentation and comments, as observed in the failing test case "test_comment_indentation."

The bug's cause may be due to the incorrect determination of the prefix length to consume based on the specified column. This could result in inaccuracies when handling whitespace and newline characters, leading to differences in the expected and actual output.

To resolve the bug, the logic for consuming the prefix and determining the appropriate length based on the provided column parameter needs to be revised. Additionally, handling of indentation and comments should be carefully managed to ensure accurate output.

Here is the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_indent = True
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_indent:
            if char == ' ':
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_line += char
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_line += char
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_indent = False
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1
        else:
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
            if char == '\n':
                if current_column <= column:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_indent = True
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This updated implementation ensures that the logic accurately handles whitespace characters, indentation, and newlines. By properly consuming the prefix based on the specified column, it addresses the underlying issue related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent.

After applying these corrections, the function should pass the failing test case and align with the expected input/output behavior, thereby resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
