## The source code of the buggy function

The buggy function is under file: `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/bgp_envs_local/repos/black_10/blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py`

Here is the buggy function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line

```


## Summary of Related Functions

Class method `_partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column)`: This function appears to process a prefix string by partially consuming it based on the provided column parameter. It seems to handle indentation, newlines, and whitespace characters to extract a portion of the prefix and return the remaining part.

The related functions or variables that are used within this function are not explicitly mentioned in the provided code snippet. It would be helpful to explore any other related functions or variables that are utilized within this method to better analyze its interactions within the codebase.


## Summary of the test cases and error messages

The failing test "test_comment_indentation" in the file "test_black.py" encounters an AssertionError in the "assertFormatEqual" method at line 156. The error occurs when comparing the expected and actual contents, where the expected string is not equal to the actual string. The stack trace indicates that the discrepancy arises from the formatting of the code involving indentation and comments. The issue is likely related to the handling of indentation and comments in the "_partially_consume_prefix" method, which mismatches the expected and actual results of the test.


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The relevant input/output values are:
- Input parameters: prefix (values: '    # comment\n    ', type: str), column (values: 8, type: int)
- Output: lines (value: [], type: list), current_line (value: '    # comment\n', type: str), current_column (value: 4, type: int), wait_for_nl (value: True, type: bool), res (value: '', type: str)
Rational: The values of the variables right before the function's return indicate that the function is not correctly handling the prefix and column parameters, leading to incorrect output.


## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

According to the given source code of the buggy function, the expected input parameters are `prefix` (a string) and `column` (an integer). The expected output variables are `lines` (a list), `current_line` (a string), `current_column` (an integer), `wait_for_nl` (a boolean), `char` (a string), and `res` (a string).

Case 1: Given the input parameters `prefix='    # comment\n    '` and `column=8`, the function should return `lines=[]`, `current_line='    # comment\n'`, `current_column=4`, `wait_for_nl=True`, `char='\n'`, and `res=''`.

Case 2: Given the input parameters `prefix=''` and `column=4`, the function should return `lines=[]`, `current_line=''`, `current_column=0`, and `wait_for_nl=False`.

Case 3: Given the input parameters `prefix='\t# comment\n\t'` and `column=2`, the function should return `lines=['\t# comment\n']`, `current_line='\t'`, `current_column=4`, and `wait_for_nl=False`.

Case 4: Given the input parameters `prefix=''` and `column=1`, the function should return `lines=[]`, `current_line=''`, `current_column=0`, and `wait_for_nl=False`.

Case 5: Given the input parameters `prefix='        # comment\n    '` and `column=8`, the function should return `lines=['        # comment\n']`, `current_line='    '`, `current_column=4`, and `wait_for_nl=False`.


## A GitHub issue for this bug

The issue's title:
```text
Indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent
```

The issue's detailed description:
```text
Operating system: Ubuntu 18.04
Python version: 3.6.3
Black version: master

Thank you @ambv for this library. When trying to run this on a codebase that uses tabs, indentation for comments past depth 0 is changed incorrectly after a dedent. Sample input (NB tabs):

if 1:
	if 2:
		pass
	# This comment should be indented the same as the next line
	pass
Black reformats this to:

if 1:
    if 2:
        pass
        # This comment should be indented the same as the next line
    pass
Note that this only happens when the input file uses tabs.
```
