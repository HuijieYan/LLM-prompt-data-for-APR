The potential error location within the function seems to be where the variables `max_allowed`, `before`, and `is_decorator` are manipulated based on different conditions. The incorrect manipulation of these variables may be causing the function to return unexpected results.

The bug's cause may be due to the incorrect assignment of `max_allowed` and the value of `is_decorator`, which affects the subsequent calculation of `newlines` and the return values of the function.

To fix the bug, the manipulation of `max_allowed`, `before`, and `is_decorator` variables should be carefully reviewed, and the conditions under which these variables are updated should be thoroughly checked.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    before = 0
    first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0] if current_line.leaves else None
    if first_leaf:
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth == 0 else 2
    
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0
    
    return before, 0
```

In the corrected code, the variables `max_allowed`, `before`, and `is_decorator` are manipulated according to the logic specified in the original function, but with small tweaks to ensure correct behavior. The conditions for updating these variables have been adjusted to reflect the intended behavior of the function across different input scenarios, and the return values have been updated accordingly to address the bug.
