Based on the provided analysis, it seems that the potential error location within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is in the conditional blocks where `max_allowed`, `before`, `is_decorator`, and `newlines` variables are manipulated. The incorrect assignment of these variables seems to be causing unexpected output for different input scenarios. To address the bug, the manipulation of these variables needs to be revised to ensure that the function returns the expected results across various cases.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, the manipulation of `max_allowed`, `before`, and `newlines` variables has been revised to ensure that the function behaves consistently across various input scenarios and returns the expected results.

This corrected code should address the potential issues identified in the analysis and resolve the bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.
