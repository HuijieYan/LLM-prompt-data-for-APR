## Bug's Cause

The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be caused by the incorrect manipulation of the `max_allowed`, `before`, and `is_decorator` variables. These variables are not being properly handled, leading to unexpected return values and causing the failing test cases.

## Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, the manipulation of the `max_allowed`, `before`, and `is_decorator` variables needs to be carefully reviewed and corrected. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the conditions and logic within the function are aligned with the expected behavior for different input scenarios.

The corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is provided below:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
       
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected code, the manipulation of the `max_allowed`, `before`, and `is_decorator` variables has been carefully reviewed and adjusted to ensure correct behavior across different input scenarios. Additionally, the conditions and logic within the function have been aligned with the expected behavior. This corrected code aims to resolve the bug and ensure consistency in the function's return values.
