The potential error location within the buggy function is the manipulation of the variables max_allowed, before, and is_decorator.

The bug's cause could be due to incorrect assignments and manipulations of these variables, leading to unexpected return values from the function. 

Approaches for fixing the bug could include:
1. Ensuring correct assignment of the max_allowed variable based on the depth of the current line.
2. Proper manipulation of the before variable to handle different scenarios and conditions.
3. Validating the is_decorator variable to accurately represent the decorator status of the current line.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth == 0 else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.depth == 0):
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file or at depth 0.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected code, the manipulation of the before and max_allowed variables has been adjusted to handle different scenarios more accurately. The handling of the is_decorator variable and the conditions based on previous and current line status have also been refined to align with the expected behavior.
This corrected code should ensure that the function behaves consistently and passes the failing test cases.
