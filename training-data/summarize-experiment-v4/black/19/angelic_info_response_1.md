The buggy function takes as input a Line object and a list of integers, and returns a tuple of two integers. The function involves a set of conditions to determine the value of the variables max_allowed, before, first_leaf.prefix, depth, is_decorator, and newlines, based on the input parameters. 

When evaluating each case, there are multiple conditions based on the values and types of the input parameters. The expected values and types of the relevant variables before the function's return are then detailed for each case. 

A corrected function must satisfy all of these cases, ensuring that it behaves consistently across various input scenarios.
