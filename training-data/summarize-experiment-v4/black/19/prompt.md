## The source code of the buggy function

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
from typing import Any, Callable, Collection, Dict, Generic, Iterable, Iterator, List, Optional, Pattern, Set, Tuple, Type, TypeVar, Union
```

The buggy function is under file: `/home/ubuntu/Desktop/bgp_envs_local/repos/black_19/black.py`

Here is the buggy function:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0

```


## Summary of Related Functions

Related functions in the same file and not in the same class as the buggy function include:

- `is_import(leaf: Leaf) -> bool`
- `append(leaf: Leaf, preformatted: bool=False) -> None`
- `is_decorator(self) -> bool`
- `is_import(self) -> bool`
- `is_class(self) -> bool`
- `is_def(self) -> bool`
- `is_flow_control(self) -> bool`
- `is_yield(self) -> bool`
- `append(self, leaf: Leaf, preformatted: bool=True) -> None`

All of these functions have different roles and are likely called at some point by the buggy function. They might be used to check the type of the `Leaf` object or to perform some processing related to the `Leaf` object in the context of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. These functions contribute to the overall behavior of the `EmptyLineTracker` class but do not directly fix the specific issue in the `EmptyLineTracker` class's `_maybe_empty_lines` method.


## Summary of the test cases and error messages

Summary:
The failing test occurs in the test_comment_in_decorator() function of the test_black.py file. The assertFormatEqual() method is returning an AssertionError, indicating that the expected output does not match the actual output. This discrepancy is related to handling comments within decorators and may be caused by the _maybe_empty_lines() function.


## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

Based on the runtime input/output values provided, the relevant parameters are as follows:

- Case 1:
  - Input parameters: current_line.depth (value: 0, type: int), current_line.leaves (value: [Leaf(AT, '@'), Leaf(NAME, 'property')], type: list), current_line.is_decorator (value: True, type: bool)
  - Output: max_allowed (value: 2, type: int), before (value: 0, type: int), is_decorator (value: True, type: bool)
  - Rational: The incorrect assignment of max_allowed and the value of is_decorator seem to be potential issues causing the function to return unexpected results.

- Case 4:
  - Input parameters: current_line.leaves (value: [Leaf(153, '# TODO: Y')], type: list), self.previous_line (value: Line(depth=0, leaves=[Leaf(AT, '@'), Leaf(NAME, 'property')], comments=[], bracket_tracker=BracketTracker(depth=0, bracket_match={}, delimiters={}, previous=Leaf(NAME, 'property'), _for_loop_variable=False, _lambda_arguments=False), inside_brackets=False), type: Line)
  - Output: max_allowed (value: 2, type: int), before (value: 0, type: int)
  - Rational: The manipulation of max_allowed and before values seems to be the issue causing the incorrect return value in this case.

Based on these cases, it seems that the manipulation of max_allowed, before, and is_decorator variables plays a critical role in the incorrect output of the function. Further investigation and debugging focusing on these variables are recommended to address the bug.


## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

The buggy function takes as input a Line object and a list of integers, and returns a tuple of two integers. The function involves a set of conditions to determine the value of the variables max_allowed, before, first_leaf.prefix, depth, is_decorator, and newlines, based on the input parameters. 

When evaluating each case, there are multiple conditions based on the values and types of the input parameters. The expected values and types of the relevant variables before the function's return are then detailed for each case. 

A corrected function must satisfy all of these cases, ensuring that it behaves consistently across various input scenarios.
