## Bug Cause

The bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the incorrect manipulation of the `max_allowed`, `before`, and `is_decorator` variables, leading to unexpected return values. This can cause the function to return incorrect output and fail the associated test cases.

It is crucial to review and correct the assignment and manipulation of these variables to address the bug.

## Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `max_allowed`, `before`, and `is_decorator` variables are manipulated correctly according to the specified conditions in the function. This can be accomplished by revisiting the conditional statements and variable assignments within the function to ensure that the logic is correctly implemented. Additionally, it is important to carefully analyze the input parameters and expected output for each condition to guarantee that the function behaves as expected across different scenarios.

Here is the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function includes the necessary fixes to address the bug and ensure that the function behaves as expected based on the specified input parameters and conditions.
