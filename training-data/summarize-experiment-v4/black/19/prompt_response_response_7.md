To fix the bug in the _maybe_empty_lines function, we need to focus on the manipulation of the variables max_allowed, before, and is_decorator, as these seem to be causing the incorrect output. 

One potential approach to fixing the bug is to carefully review the logic and conditions within the function to ensure that the values of these variables are being correctly determined based on the input parameters. It may also be necessary to adjust the conditional statements to better handle different cases and scenarios.

Here's the corrected version of the _maybe_empty_lines function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, I have adjusted the logic and conditions to ensure that the variables max_allowed, before, and is_decorator are correctly determined based on the input parameters. This should address the bug and ensure that the function behaves consistently across various input scenarios, passing the failing test.
