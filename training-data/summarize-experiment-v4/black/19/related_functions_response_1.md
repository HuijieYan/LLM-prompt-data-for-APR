Related functions in the same file and not in the same class as the buggy function include:

- `is_import(leaf: Leaf) -> bool`
- `append(leaf: Leaf, preformatted: bool=False) -> None`
- `is_decorator(self) -> bool`
- `is_import(self) -> bool`
- `is_class(self) -> bool`
- `is_def(self) -> bool`
- `is_flow_control(self) -> bool`
- `is_yield(self) -> bool`
- `append(self, leaf: Leaf, preformatted: bool=True) -> None`

All of these functions have different roles and are likely called at some point by the buggy function. They might be used to check the type of the `Leaf` object or to perform some processing related to the `Leaf` object in the context of the `EmptyLineTracker` class. These functions contribute to the overall behavior of the `EmptyLineTracker` class but do not directly fix the specific issue in the `EmptyLineTracker` class's `_maybe_empty_lines` method.
