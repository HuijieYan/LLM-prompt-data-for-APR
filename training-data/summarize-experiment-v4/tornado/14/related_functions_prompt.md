Help developers grasp why a function is failing by outlining its interactions with other functions or classes. Focus on the signatures and roles of related functions or classes to reveal how the problematic function fits within the larger codebase. Summarize related functions by refering to the example below. You should not solve the error directly.

## Example Buggy Function with Related Functions
```python
def log_action(action: str) -> None:
    # Details of this function are not the focal point

class DocumentProcessor:
    """
    This class processes documents by appending text, removing text, and updating the title.
    """

    def append_text(self, text: str) -> None:
        # The implementation details of this method are not our concern

    def remove_text(self, length: int) -> None:
        # Ignore the workings of this method

    def update_title(self, new_title: str) -> None:
        # The inner workings of this method are not relevant

    # The function with an issue needing attention
    def process_document(self, text_to_append: str, remove_chars: int, new_title: str) -> None:
        self.remove_text(remove_chars)
        self.append_text(text_to_append)
        self.update_title(new_title)
        log_action(f"Processed document " + self.title)
```

## Example Summary
Class docstring: This class processes documents by appending text, removing text, and updating the title. The related functions `append_text`, `remove_text`, and `update_title` are likely used to perform these operations.

`def remove_text(self, length: int) -> None`: This function likely takes a length parameter, which is presumably the number of characters to be removed from the start or end of the document.

`def append_text(self, text: str) -> None`: From the name of the function, we can infer that this function appends text to an existing document, which is maintained by the current class, `DocumentProcessor`.

`def update_title(self, new_title: str) -> None`: This function likely changes the internal record of the class to store a new title name.

`log_action()` function call: Prints a sequence of actions.


## Buggy Function with Related Functions
```python
# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def current(instance=True):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# This function from the same file, but not the same class, is called by the buggy function
def make_current(self):
    # Please ignore the body of this function

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    """
    A level-triggered I/O loop.
    
    We use ``epoll`` (Linux) or ``kqueue`` (BSD and Mac OS X) if they
    are available, or else we fall back on select(). If you are
    implementing a system that needs to handle thousands of
    simultaneous connections, you should use a system that supports
    either ``epoll`` or ``kqueue``.
    
    Example usage for a simple TCP server:

            sock.setblocking(0)
            sock.bind(("", port))
            sock.listen(128)

    By default, a newly-constructed `IOLoop` becomes the thread's current
    `IOLoop`, unless there already is a current `IOLoop`. This behavior
    can be controlled with the ``make_current`` argument to the `IOLoop`
    constructor: if ``make_current=True``, the new `IOLoop` will always
    try to become current and it raises an error if there is already a
    current instance. If ``make_current=False``, the new `IOLoop` will
    not try to become current.
    
    .. versionchanged:: 4.2
       Added the ``make_current`` keyword argument to the `IOLoop`
       constructor.
