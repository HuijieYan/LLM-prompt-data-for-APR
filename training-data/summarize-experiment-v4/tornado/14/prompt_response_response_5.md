## Bug's Location
The bug is located in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class.

## Bug's Cause
The cause of the bug is that the code inside the `initialize` method checks if the current `IOLoop` instance exists and then raises a RuntimeError "current IOLoop already exists" if `make_current` is True. However, this check seems to be redundant and unnecessary.

## Approach to Fix the Bug
To fix the bug, we can remove the redundant check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance and directly make the current `IOLoop` if `make_current` is True.

## Corrected Code
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None or make_current:
        self.make_current()
```
In the corrected code, we check if `make_current` is None or True, and then directly call `self.make_current()`. This removes the unnecessary check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance and simplifies the logic.
