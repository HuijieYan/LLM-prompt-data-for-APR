## Bug's Potential Location

The potential bug seems to be located within the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class in the `tornado/ioloop.py` file.


## Bug's Potential Cause

The bug's cause seems to stem from the logic within the `initialize` method. When `make_current` parameter is set to `True`, the code first checks if the current IOLoop instance exists. If it does, it should raise a RuntimeError "current IOLoop already exists". However, the bug occurs because even if the current IOLoop instance exists, it still goes ahead and tries to make the current IOLoop instance. This leads to the incorrect RuntimeError being raised.


## Approach for Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, the logic within the `initialize` method needs to be adjusted. Specifically, when `make_current` is `True` and an existing current IOLoop instance is found, it should raise the RuntimeError "current IOLoop already exists" and stop further execution.


## The Corrected Code

Here is the corrected `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By making this correction, the `initialize` method now correctly checks for the existence of the current IOLoop instance when `make_current` is `True`, and raises an error if it already exists.
