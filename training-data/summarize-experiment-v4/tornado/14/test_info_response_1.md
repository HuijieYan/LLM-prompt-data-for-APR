The failing test 'test_force_current' attempted to create a new IOLoop with the 'make_current' parameter set to True, and then verified that the new loop is the current one. However, the call to IOLoop(make_current=True) raised a RuntimeError "current IOLoop already exists" as expected. The stack trace shows that the error was raised within the 'initialize' method of the 'EPollIOLoop' class, which is inside the 'tornado/platform/epoll.py' file. This likely indicates that the bug is within the 'initialize' method of the 'EPollIOLoop' class.
