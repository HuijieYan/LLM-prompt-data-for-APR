The potential error location is within the conditional statement that checks for the existence of the current IOLoop instance based on the value of make_current.

The bug is caused by the way the `initialize` function handles the `make_current` parameter. If `make_current` is True, it checks for an existing current IOLoop and raises an error if there is one. However, even if there is no existing current IOLoop, it still raises an error "current IOLoop already exists".

To fix the bug, we need to update the logic to correctly handle the case when `make_current` is True and there is no existing current IOLoop.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this version, when `make_current` is True, it checks for an existing current IOLoop and raises an error only if there is one. Otherwise, it proceeds to make the current IOLoop.

This corrected version should resolve the issue posted on GitHub, and the program should pass the failing test.
