## Bug Cause
The bug seems to be caused by the condition checking in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is `True`, it checks if the current IOLoop instance exists, and if it does, it raises a RuntimeError. However, this check is causing a problem because the condition is erroneously always evaluating to true.

## Suggestions for Fixing the Bug
To fix the bug, we need to modify the condition check in the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `make_current` is `True`. This involves ensuring that the error is only raised when an IOLoop instance already exists.

## Corrected Code
Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current is True:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
``` 

We have changed the condition to check if the current IOLoop instance is not None when `make_current` is `True`, and then raise an error accordingly.

By making this change, the program should now pass the failing test and successfully resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
