Class IOLoop docstring: This class represents a level-triggered I/O loop. It mentions using epoll (Linux) or kqueue (BSD and Mac OS X) if available, or falling back on select(). The class also includes example usage for a simple TCP server.

`def current(instance=True)`: This function, both at the module level and within the class, likely returns the current IOLoop instance.

`def make_current(self)`: This function, also within the class, is likely used to make the current IOLoop instance.

`def initialize(self, make_current=None)`: This is the buggy function in question. It seems to determine whether to make the current IOLoop instance based on the value of `make_current` parameter. If `make_current` is not provided, it checks for an existing current IOLoop and makes the current IOLoop if there isn't one. If `make_current` is `True`, it checks for an existing current IOLoop and raises an error if there is one. Then, it makes the current IOLoop.

The interactions of `initialize`, `current`, and `make_current` functions determine the current IOLoop instance. Any issues related to setting or checking the current IOLoop could be stemming from these interactions.
