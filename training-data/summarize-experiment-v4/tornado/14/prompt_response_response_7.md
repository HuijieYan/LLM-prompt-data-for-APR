The potential error location within the buggy function is at the following line:

```python
if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
```

The bug's cause is the conditional check in the function `initialize`. When `make_current` is True, the function checks if the current IOLoop instance is None, and if not, it raises a RuntimeError "current IOLoop already exists". This contradicts the intended behavior of the function.

To fix the bug, the conditional check for `make_current` should be removed, and the function should directly call `make_current` if no current IOLoop instance exists.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current or (make_current is None and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None):
        self.make_current()
```
With this correction, the program should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
