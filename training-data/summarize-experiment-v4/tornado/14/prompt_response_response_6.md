Based on the analysis, the potential error location within the buggy function is the conditional statement checking for the existence of the current IOLoop instance before raising an error. The bug's cause is that the code is not properly handling the case where make_current is True and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None.

To fix the bug, we should revise the conditional statements to properly handle the case where make_current is True and there is an existing current IOLoop instance. We can do this by restructuring the logic to first check the value of make_current and then handle the cases accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:
        if make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

By revising the conditional statement to first check if make_current is True and an existing current IOLoop instance exists, we can ensure that the appropriate error is raised when necessary and the new IOLoop is made current only when it doesn't already exist.

This corrected code should address the bug and resolve the issue posted on GitHub related to this issue.
