Potential Error:
The `initialize` function seems to have a logical error. When `make_current` is `True`, it should be checking if the current IOLoop instance exists and then raise an error if it does. However, the current implementation checks if the current IOLoop instance is `None` and then raises an error if it is not `None`.

Bug's Cause:
The cause of the bug is that the condition is inverted in the `initialize` function. It should be checking if the current IOLoop instance exists (is not `None`) and then raising an error. Instead, it incorrectly checks if the current IOLoop instance is `None`.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
To fix the bug, the condition in the `initialize` function needs to be inverted. It should check if the current IOLoop instance is not `None` and then raise an error if it is not `None.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
