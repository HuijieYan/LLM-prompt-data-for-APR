## Bug Cause

The bug likely lies with the conditional check for the `make_current` parameter in the `initialize` function. When `make_current` is True and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None, it should not raise a RuntimeError "current IOLoop already exists". This indicates that there is a logical error in the conditional check.

## Approach for Fixing the Bug

To fix the bug, you could modify the conditional statement for checking `make_current` and `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`, ensuring that the correct error is raised only when the current IOLoop actually exists and `make_current` is also set to True. 

Additionally, it's important to ensure that the function behaves as expected in cases where `make_current` is not provided (i.e., it should make the current IOLoop if there isn't one).

## Corrected Code

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function should now correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and the existing current IOLoop instance, resolving the issue reported in GitHub.
