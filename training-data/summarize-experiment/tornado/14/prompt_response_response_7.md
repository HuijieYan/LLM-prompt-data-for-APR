The problem with the current implementation of the `initialize` function is that it checks if the current IOLoop instance is `None`. If it is, then it calls `self.make_current()`. However, if `make_current` is set to `True`, the function should raise an error if the current IOLoop already exists. The current implementation does not handle this case correctly.

To resolve this issue, we need to modify the `initialize` function to properly handle the case when `make_current` is set to `True` and a current IOLoop instance already exists.

Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if current IOLoop already exists
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected version, we have added a condition to check if the current IOLoop instance is not `None` when `make_current` is set to `True`. If the current IOLoop instance already exists, it will raise a `RuntimeError` as intended.

This fix addresses the issue highlighted in the error message, which is that the current IOLoop already exists when `make_current` is set to `True`. This corrected function can now be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version to resolve the issue.
