Based on the error message and the test case `test_force_current` from the `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` file, it is evident that the issue lies in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class.

The error message "current IOLoop already exists" is raised in the `initialize` method when `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop instance already exists.

The potential error location is within the conditional statement:
```python
elif make_current:
    if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    self.make_current()
```

The issue occurs because the condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is incorrectly checking if the current IOLoop instance is `None`, and then it raises an error. However, when `make_current` is `True`, it should directly call `self.make_current()` without checking the existence of the current IOLoop instance.

To fix this issue, we should remove the conditional check and directly call `self.make_current()` when `make_current` is `True`.

Here's the revised version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

With this fix, the function will now correctly make the current IOLoop without checking for its existence when `make_current` is `True`.
