The test case `test_force_current` initializes an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`, and then attempts to create another IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`, which should fail and raise a `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists`. The error occurs because the buggy `initialize` function does not handle the case where `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop instance already exists.

The potential error location within the `initialize` function is the conditional statement that checks if `make_current` is True and an IOLoop instance already exists. This conditional statement should either call the `make_current` method or raise a `RuntimeError`, but the buggy function is not handling this case correctly.

The bug occurs because the conditional logic in the `initialize` function does not properly handle the case where `make_current` is True and an IOLoop instance already exists. As a result, the `RuntimeError` is being raised unexpectedly, leading to the failure of the test case.

To fix the bug, the conditional logic in the `initialize` function needs to be updated to handle the case where `make_current` is True and an IOLoop instance already exists. It should either call the `make_current` method or raise a `RuntimeError` based on the existence of the IOLoop instance.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected code, we first retrieve the current IOLoop instance using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)`. Then, we update the conditional statements to check the existence of the current IOLoop instance and handle the `make_current` parameter accordingly. This ensures that the `initialize` function behaves as expected and passes the test case.
