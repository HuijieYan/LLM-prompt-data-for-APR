The error occurs in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class, specifically in the conditional statement for when `make_current` is `True`. The error message indicates that the current `IOLoop` already exists, which is contradictory to the condition that checks if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`.

The bug occurs because of the incorrect check in the conditional statement. The conditional statement `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is used to determine if the `IOLoop.current` instance exists or not. However, when `make_current` is `True`, the code should check if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists, and if it does, raise an error.

To fix the bug, the conditional statement for `make_current` being `True` should be modified to check if the current `IOLoop` instance already exists and raise an error if it does.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function will now properly check for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance and raise an error if it already exists when `make_current` is `True`.
