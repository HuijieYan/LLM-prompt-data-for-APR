Based on the provided information, the buggy function `initialize` has a potential issue with the conditional logic that handles the `make_current` parameter. The error message indicates that a `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists` is being raised when `make_current` is True and an IOLoop instance already exists.

The issue stems from the conditional logic not properly handling the case where `make_current` is True and an IOLoop instance already exists. The conditional statement should be revised to handle this scenario appropriately.

To fix this bug, the conditional logic in the `initialize` function should be updated to correctly handle the case where `make_current` is True and an IOLoop instance already exists. Additionally, the testing function `test_force_current` should be updated to reflect the expected behavior when a RuntimeError is raised.

Here is the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the revised code, we first assign the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` to `current_instance` to avoid calling the method multiple times. The conditional logic is updated to correctly handle the case where `make_current` is True and an IOLoop instance already exists.

With this updated logic, the function should now handle the `make_current` parameter as intended and resolve the bug.

This corrected function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
