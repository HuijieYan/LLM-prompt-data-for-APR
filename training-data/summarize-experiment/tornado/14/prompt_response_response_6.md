The bug occurs in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The function is intended to initialize the IOLoop instance and ensure that it is the current IOLoop, but there are issues with the conditional checks and the handling of the `make_current` parameter.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the conditional checks for `make_current` are not correctly implemented. In the buggy function, when `make_current` is True, it should raise an error if the current IOLoop already exists. However, the current conditional check is not correctly performing this validation.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that:
1. When `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop instance already exists, a RuntimeError should be raised.
2. When `make_current` is None and there is no current IOLoop instance, the IOLoop should be made the current IOLoop instance.
3. When `make_current` is False, the function should not attempt to make the IOLoop the current instance.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected code:
- We store the result of `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` in the variable `current_instance` to avoid repeated function calls.
- We then make the necessary conditional checks based on the value of `make_current` and the existence of the current IOLoop instance.
- If `make_current` is None and no current IOLoop instance exists, we make the IOLoop the current instance.
- If `make_current` is True and a current IOLoop instance already exists, we raise a RuntimeError.
- If `make_current` is False, no action is taken to make the IOLoop the current instance.

This corrected code resolves the issue and ensures that the `initialize` method behaves as intended.
