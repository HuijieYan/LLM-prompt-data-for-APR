The error occurs at line 252 in the `initialize` function, where the code checks if the current IOLoop is `None`. If it is, then it attempts to make the current IOLoop instance. However, if `make_current` is `True` and the current IOLoop is not `None`, the code incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError`, stating that the current IOLoop already exists.

The bug occurs because the logic for handling the `make_current` parameter is incorrect. When `make_current` is `True`, the function should check if the current IOLoop instance is `None` and only raise an error if it's not `None`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic of the `initialize` function to properly handle the `make_current` parameter and the current IOLoop instance.

Here is the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the function properly handles the `make_current` parameter and checks the current IOLoop instance before raising a `RuntimeError`. This revised code can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.
