Summary:
The issue reported on GitHub is related to the behavior of the ioloop.py file, specifically in line 252, where IOLoop.current(instance=False) is evaluated as None. The problem arises when this condition is met, leading to the unexpected raising of the "already exists" error. The issue description highlights the inconsistency in the program's behavior and questions the rationale behind the error being triggered in this particular scenario. This bug disrupts the expected flow of the program and requires a detailed investigation to pinpoint and resolve the underlying cause.
