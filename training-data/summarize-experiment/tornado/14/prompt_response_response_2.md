The buggy function `initialize` has an issue related to the handling of the `make_current` parameter, leading to unexpected behavior and test failure. When `make_current` is True and an IOLoop instance already exists, the function should raise a RuntimeError as indicated by the test case. However, the current implementation does not handle this case properly.

The issue is located within the conditional statements that handle the `make_current` parameter. It appears that the logic is not correctly checking for the existence of an IOLoop instance and the appropriate action is not being taken based on the value of `make_current`.

To address this bug, the conditional logic in the `initialize` function should be revised to properly handle the case where `make_current` is True and an IOLoop instance already exists. Additionally, the logic for checking the existence of the IOLoop instance needs to be reviewed to ensure it is accurate.

Here is the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In the corrected code, we first store the current IOLoop instance in the `current_instance` variable. Then, we use this variable to check whether an IOLoop instance exists and take the appropriate action based on the value of `make_current`. This ensures that the function properly handles the case where `make_current` is True and an IOLoop instance already exists.

This corrected code can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the `initialize` function.
