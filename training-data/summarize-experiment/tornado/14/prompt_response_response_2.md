The error message indicates that on line 252 of the `tornado/ioloop.py` file, the condition `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is evaluated as False, resulting in a `RuntimeError` being raised for "current IOLoop already exists". This suggests that the condition `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is not working as intended.

The potential error location is in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class, specifically in the conditional statements that check the value of `make_current` and the existence of the current IOLoop.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely a logic error in the conditional statements. The current condition checking might not accurately reflect the intended behavior.

Possible approaches to fixing the bug:
1. Update the conditional statements to accurately check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance and handle the `make_current` parameter appropriately.
2. Ensure that the conditional logic in the function aligns with the expected behavior based on the test cases.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

The function now correctly retrieves the current IOLoop instance and checks for its existence based on the value of `make_current`. This revised version should resolve the issue.
