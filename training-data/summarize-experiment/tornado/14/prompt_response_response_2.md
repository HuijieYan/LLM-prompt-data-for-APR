The issue seems to arise from the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The method checks for the existence of the current `IOLoop` instance and attempts to make the current `IOLoop` if the `make_current` parameter is `True`. However, if the `make_current` parameter is `None`, it also attempts to make the current `IOLoop` if there is no current instance.

The issue occurs when `make_current` is `True` and a current `IOLoop` already exists. In this case, the function should raise an error. However, the current implementation raises an error even when `make_current` is `None` and no current `IOLoop` exists.

To fix this issue, the logic inside the `initialize` method needs to be revised to correctly handle the cases where `make_current` is `None` and `True`. Here's the corrected version of the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the method first checks for the existence of a current `IOLoop`. If `make_current` is `None`, it attempts to make the current `IOLoop` only if no current instance exists. If `make_current` is `True`, it raises an error if a current `IOLoop` already exists, otherwise, it makes the current `IOLoop`.

This corrected version should resolve the issue and avoid raising an error when it's not necessary.
