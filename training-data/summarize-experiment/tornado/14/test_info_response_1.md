The error message is indicating that there is an issue with the `test_force_current` function located in the file `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py`. The specific error is stemming from the line `self.io_loop = IOLoop(make_current=True)`. The error message states that a `RuntimeError: current IOLoop already exists` has been thrown.

Upon examining the `test_force_current` function, it is evident that the IOLoop `self.io_loop` is being initialized with `make_current=True`. This initialization is followed by a check using `assertRaises` to see if attempting to create another IOLoop instance with `make_current=True` will fail, which indeed it does.

The corresponding segment in the buggy function code is the `initialize` method.
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
According to the error message, the line `raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")` within the `initialize` method is being triggered.

The issue is that the `initialize` method is not handling the case where `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop already exists as expected. Therefore, the RuntimeError is being raised correctly. However, the testing function is not structured to bypass this error and allow the test to continue, which leads to the test failure.

In order to resolve this issue, the `initialize` method in the buggy function code should be updated to properly handle the case where `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop already exists. Additionally, the `test_force_current` function should be updated to reflect the behavior that is expected when a RuntimeError is raised, to allow the test to pass.
