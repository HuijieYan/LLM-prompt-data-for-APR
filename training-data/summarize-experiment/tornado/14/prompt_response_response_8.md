Based on the error message and the test case, it is evident that there is a discrepancy in the behavior of the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The specific line in question is likely the conditional statement that checks for the existence of the current IOLoop instance and raises a RuntimeError if it already exists.

The bug occurs when the `initialize` method is called with `make_current=True` and the current IOLoop instance already exists. The conditional logic in the `initialize` method does not handle this scenario properly, resulting in the unexpected RuntimeError being raised.

To address this issue, the conditional statements in the `initialize` method need to be adjusted to correctly handle the case where `make_current` is True and an IOLoop instance already exists. Additionally, the logic for checking the existence of the IOLoop instance should be reviewed to ensure it accurately identifies whether an instance already exists.

The following revised version of the `initialize` method addresses the bug by implementing the necessary conditional checks and actions based on the value of `make_current`, as well as the existence of the current IOLoop instance:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```
In this revised version, the `current_instance` variable is used to store the current IOLoop instance, and the conditional statements are adjusted to check its value and handle the `make_current` parameter accordingly. This ensures that the `initialize` method behaves as expected and resolves the bug.
