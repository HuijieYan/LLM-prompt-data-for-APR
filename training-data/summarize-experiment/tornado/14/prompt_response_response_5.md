Based on the test case and error message provided, it seems that the issue lies within the conditional logic of the `initialize` method in the `IOLoop` class. Specifically, when `make_current` is True and an IOLoop instance already exists, the method incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` instead of handling the situation appropriately.

The reason for the bug is that the conditional logic in the `initialize` method does not properly handle the case where `make_current` is True and an IOLoop instance already exists. This results in an unexpected `RuntimeError` being raised, leading to the failure of the test case.

To fix the bug, the conditional logic in the `initialize` method should be revised to check the existence of an IOLoop instance and either call `make_current` or raise a `RuntimeError` based on the value of `make_current`. Additionally, the test case should be updated to handle the expected behavior when a `RuntimeError` is raised.

Here is the corrected version of the `initialize` method in the `IOLoop` class:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current and IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
        raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
    elif make_current:
        self.make_current()
```

In this fixed version, the conditional logic has been updated to properly handle the case when `make_current` is True and an IOLoop instance already exists. The `make_current` method is called only if the IOLoop instance does not exist, and a `RuntimeError` is raised if it does exist.

Additionally, the test case should also be updated to handle the expected behavior when a `RuntimeError` is raised, allowing the test to pass.

These changes should address the bug and ensure that the `initialize` method behaves as expected when `make_current` is True and an IOLoop instance already exists.
