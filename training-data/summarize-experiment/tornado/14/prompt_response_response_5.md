The error occurs in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. This method is intended to initialize the IOLoop instance and make it the current IOLoop if required. However, the error occurs because even when `make_current` is set to `True` and there is already a current IOLoop, the code is still trying to make the IOLoop current, resulting in the RuntimeError.

The fix for this bug would involve modifying the logic inside the `initialize` method to correctly handle the cases where `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current IOLoop.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

By updating the condition to `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None` instead of `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`, we ensure that if `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current IOLoop, a RuntimeError will be raised, as intended.

This revised code will address the bug and prevent the RuntimeError from occurring in the described scenario.
