The test function `test_force_current` in the `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` file sets `make_current` as `True` when initializing the `IOLoop` object. The error message indicates that the raise of "current IOLoop already exists" occurs when `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None. This suggests that the logic within the `initialize` function is not handling the case where the current `IOLoop` already exists appropriately.

The buggy function `initialize` in `tornado/ioloop.py` should be modified to properly handle the case when the current `IOLoop` already exists. If `make_current` is `True` and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists, it should not raise an error.

The corrected code for the `initialize` function should resolve this issue. Here is the revised function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            # Do nothing if the current IOLoop instance already exists
            pass
        else:
            self.make_current()
```

The revised function now properly checks if the current instance of `IOLoop` exists. If `make_current` is `True` and the current instance already exists, it does not raise an error. This corrected version of the function should address the bug and handle the case appropriately.
