Upon analysis of the test case and the error message, it is evident that the issue lies within the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The test case `test_force_current` attempts to create a new `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True` and expects a `RuntimeError` to be raised, which is the intended behavior. However, the current implementation of the `initialize` method does not handle this scenario correctly, leading to the unexpected RuntimeError being raised.

The bug occurs in the `initialize` method when the `make_current` parameter is True, and an IOLoop instance already exists. The conditional logic in the `initialize` method fails to handle this scenario properly and triggers the RuntimeError when it should not.

To fix the bug, the `initialize` method needs to be updated to correctly handle the case where `make_current` is True and an IOLoop instance already exists. The conditional statements should be revised to check for the existence of the current IOLoop instance and only raise a RuntimeError if `make_current` is True and an instance already exists. Additionally, the method should be modified to call `self.make_current()` if `make_current` is True and no current instance exists.

Here is the corrected code for the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class:
```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (omitted code)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
        if make_current is None:
            if current_instance is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:
            if current_instance is not None:
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```
In this corrected version of the `initialize` method, the `current_instance` is captured at the beginning of the method. Then, the conditional statements are updated to use this variable to check for the existence of a current IOLoop instance and take appropriate actions based on the value of `make_current`.

By making these changes, the `initialize` method should now handle the `make_current` parameter correctly and resolve the issue that led to the unexpected RuntimeError being raised in the test case. This revised code can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the `initialize` method.
