The test case `test_force_current` is trying to create an `IOLoop` instance with `make_current=True`. This should throw a `RuntimeError` because the `IOLoop.current()` is already set, as specified in the test function. However, the buggy function `initialize` does not handle this case correctly.

The bug is occurring because the if condition `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is evaluating to False when it should be True, causing the `make_current` method to be called even when the current `IOLoop` instance already exists. This leads to the subsequent check for `IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` to evaluate to False, triggering the `RuntimeError` to be raised incorrectly.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the condition to properly check if the current `IOLoop` instance exists, and if it does, then raise the `RuntimeError`. If the current `IOLoop` instance does not exist, then we can proceed to call the `make_current` method.

Here's the revised code for the `initialize` method:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

With this change, the `initialize` method will now correctly handle the case when `make_current` is True and the current `IOLoop` instance already exists.
