The error occurs in the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class. The issue arises because the code is attempting to check if the current IOLoop exists and then make it the current IOLoop if it doesn't exist. However, if `make_current` is True, it should check if the current IOLoop already exists and only raise an error if it does.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `initialize` method to properly handle the case when `make_current` is True.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` method of the `IOLoop` class:

```python
class IOLoop(Configurable):
    # ... (other code)

    def initialize(self, make_current=None):
        if make_current is None:
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
                self.make_current()
        elif make_current:  # Handle the case when make_current is True
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if the current IOLoop already exists
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")  # Raise an error if it does
            self.make_current()
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function will handle the case when `make_current` is True and properly check if the current IOLoop already exists before attempting to make it the current IOLoop.

This fix ensures that the error related to the current IOLoop already existing is only raised when the current IOLoop needs to be made and already exists.

You can use the corrected code as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.
