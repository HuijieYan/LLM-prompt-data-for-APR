The bug occurs in the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class. The issue arises because when `make_current` is True, the code is incorrectly raising a `RuntimeError` if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is None. This is contradictory since `make_current` being True implies that the IOLoop should become the current IOLoop.

To fix this bug, we need to update the logic in the `initialize` function so that it sets the IOLoop as the current IOLoop when `make_current` is True, regardless of the current state of the IOLoop.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            # Remove the validation for the current IOLoop and always set the IOLoop as the current IOLoop
            pass
        self.make_current()
```

This fix removes the `raise RuntimeError` statement and instead just proceeds to set the IOLoop as the current IOLoop when `make_current` is True. This resolves the issue of contradictory logic and addresses the bug in the function.
