Based on the provided test case and error message, the issue seems to be with the behavior of the `initialize` method in the `IOLoop` class. When `make_current` is True and the current IOLoop already exists, the `initialize` method incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` instead of handling the situation in a more appropriate way.

The bug occurs due to the conditional logic in the `initialize` method. When `make_current` is True and an IOLoop instance already exists, the method incorrectly raises a `RuntimeError` instead of handling the situation gracefully.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the conditional logic in the `initialize` method to handle the case where `make_current` is True and an IOLoop instance already exists. Instead of raising a `RuntimeError`, the method should skip creating a new IOLoop instance and continue executing.

Here is the corrected code for the `initialize` method in the `IOLoop` class:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            # Skip creating a new IOLoop instance if it already exists
            return
        self.make_current()
```

With this fix, the `initialize` method will check if an IOLoop instance already exists when `make_current` is True, and if it does, it will bypass creating a new instance and continue execution without raising a `RuntimeError`.

This corrected version of the `initialize` method can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version to resolve the issue.
