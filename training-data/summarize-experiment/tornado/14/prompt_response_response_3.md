The test case `test_force_current` is designed to ensure that a new IOLoop can only become the current IOLoop if `make_current` is set to `True`, and that a RuntimeError is raised if a current IOLoop already exists.

The potential error location within the `initialize` function of the `EPollIOLoop` class is the conditional statement `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None`, which checks if there is no current IOLoop instance. If this condition is met, the function attempts to make the current IOLoop, and if `make_current` is set to `True`, it raises a RuntimeError if there is already a current instance.

The bug occurs because the conditional statement `if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None` is used to check for the existence of a current IOLoop instance, but the subsequent logic does not properly handle the case when a current instance already exists.

To fix the bug, the logic to check for the existence of a current IOLoop instance needs to be modified, and the subsequent handling of `make_current` and the raising of a RuntimeError also needs to be adjusted.

The corrected code for the `initialize` function of the `EPollIOLoop` class is as follows:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    current_instance = IOLoop.current(instance=False)
    
    if make_current is None:
        if current_instance is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if current_instance is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

In this corrected code, we first obtain the current instance of the IOLoop using `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` and store it in the `current_instance` variable. Then we modify the conditional statements to properly handle the checking for the existence of a current IOLoop instance and the subsequent logic for making the IOLoop current or raising a RuntimeError.

The corrected logic ensures that the behavior aligns with the expected functionality described in the test case, and the code can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.
