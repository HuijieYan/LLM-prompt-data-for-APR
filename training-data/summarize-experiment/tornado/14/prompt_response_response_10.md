The test case `test_force_current` in the `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` file is trying to instantiate `IOLoop` with `make_current=True`. According to the error message, the issue arises when the `initialize` function of the `IOLoop` class is called. Inside `initialize`, it checks if the `make_current` parameter is `True`, and if so, it checks if the current `IOLoop` instance is already existing, and if it is, it raises a `RuntimeError`.

The bug occurs because when `make_current` is `True`, it tries to make the current `IOLoop` instance only if there is no current instance. But if there is already an existing instance, it should not try to create a new one and should directly raise an error.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the logic inside the `initialize` function to correctly handle the case where `make_current` is `True` and there is already a current `IOLoop` instance.

Below is the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:  # If make_current is not specified
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:  # If there is no current instance
            self.make_current()  # Make the current instance
    elif make_current:  # If make_current is True
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # If there is already a current instance
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")  # Raise an error
        self.make_current()  # Make the current instance
```

With this correction, the `initialize` function first checks if `make_current` is `True` and if there is already a current instance of `IOLoop`. If there is, it raises a `RuntimeError`. If there is no current instance, it proceeds to make the current instance. This updated logic addresses the bug and ensures that the `IOLoop` instance is handled correctly based on the value of `make_current`.

Please note that this corrected code should be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version to resolve the issue.
