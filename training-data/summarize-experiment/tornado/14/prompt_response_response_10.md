The test function `test_force_current` tries to create an instance of `IOLoop` with `make_current=True`. This should work the first time, but it should raise a `RuntimeError` if a current instance already exists.

The problem occurs in the buggy function `initialize`. The `if` condition checks if `make_current` is `None`, and if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, it calls `self.make_current()`. However, the `elif` condition checks if `make_current` is `True`, and if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is `None`, it raises a `RuntimeError`. This is incorrect, as if `make_current` is `True`, it should validate if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`. The buggy code does the opposite, which leads to the error.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `elif` condition to check if `make_current` is `True`, and if `IOLoop.current(instance=False)` is not `None`, then raise a `RuntimeError`. This will ensure that we are handling the cases correctly and preventing the creation of a duplicate current instance.

Here's the corrected code for the `initialize` function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This corrected code addresses the bug by handling the `make_current` flag appropriately and checking for the presence of a current instance before making a new instance current.
