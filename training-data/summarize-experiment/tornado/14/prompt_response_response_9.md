The error occurs on line 252 of the `initialize` method in the `IOLoop` class. It checks if the current instance of `IOLoop` is None, and if so, it creates a new current instance using the `make_current` method. However, if `make_current` is set to True and the current instance already exists, it raises a `RuntimeError`. The bug occurs when `make_current` is set to True and the current instance already exists, but it still attempts to create a new instance and then raises the `RuntimeError`. This behavior is incorrect and leads to the bug.

To address this bug, the `initialize` function needs to be revised. The correct approach is to first check if `make_current` is True and the current instance already exists, and if so, raise the `RuntimeError` immediately. Then, if `make_current` is None, the function should check if the current instance is None before attempting to create a new current instance.

Here's the revised version of the function:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()
```

This revised function will correctly handle the `make_current` parameter and ensure that the current instance is not created if it already exists when `make_current` is True. This fixed version can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
