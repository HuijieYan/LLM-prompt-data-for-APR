The test case `test_force_current` in the `tornado/test/ioloop_test.py` file is trying to create an IOLoop instance with `make_current=True`. The test then checks if the IOLoop instance is the current one using `IOLoop.current()`. 

The error message indicates a problem with the `initialize` method in the IOLoop class, specifically at line 252. The error is raised because the current IOLoop already exists, even though the `make_current` parameter is set to True. This behavior is incorrect because if `make_current` is True, the intention is to try to make the new IOLoop instance the current one and raise an error if there is already a current instance.

The issue seems to be with the conditional statement inside the `initialize` method not working as intended.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the conditional statements inside the `initialize` method to ensure that the behavior aligns with the expected functionality outlined in the test case and the class documentation.

Here's the revised version of the function that resolves the issue:

```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    else:  # Removed the elif statement
        if make_current:  # Check if make_current is True
            if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is not None:  # Check if a current instance already exists
                raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
            self.make_current()
```

With this revision, the function correctly handles the scenario where `make_current` is True and checks if a current IOLoop instance already exists before attempting to make the new instance the current one.
