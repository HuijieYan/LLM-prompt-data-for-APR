The issue with the function is in the logic for checking the column and handling the waiting for newline conditions. The current implementation does not properly handle the indentation, spaces, and tabs, which leads to incorrect behavior in cases where the prefix contains tabs and spaces.

To fix the bug, the logic for checking the column and handling the waiting for newline conditions needs to be corrected. Additionally, the function should handle the case of an empty prefix correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    if not prefix:  # Handle empty prefix
        return "", prefix

    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
                else:
                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This revised version should address the issues in the original function and provide the correct behavior for consuming the prefix up to the specified column.
