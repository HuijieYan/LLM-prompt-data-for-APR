The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not processing the input prefix correctly, leading to incorrect results. It fails to handle different types of indentation (such as tabs and spaces) and newline characters consistently. This inconsistency in handling indentation causes the function to return incorrect results in some cases.

To fix the bug, we need to carefully review and possibly rewrite the logic for handling indentation, spaces, tabs, and newline characters. Thorough testing with various input prefixes and column values will be necessary to ensure that the function behaves consistently and accurately returns the expected results.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line + char)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        else:  # Non-whitespace character
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
          
        if current_column >= column:
            if current_line.strip():
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

    res = ''.join(lines)
    return res, prefix[len(res):]
```

This revised version of the function addresses the issues identified in the bug analysis and should now handle different types of indentation and newline characters consistently. It iterates through the characters of the `prefix` string, updating `current_line` and `current_column` based on the type of character encountered and correctly handles the conditions for returning the accumulated lines and the remaining unparsed portion of the input `prefix`.
