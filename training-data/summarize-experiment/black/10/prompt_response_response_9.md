Based on the provided information, the issue appears to be related to the incorrect handling of indentation for tabulated comments following a dedent in codebases that use tabs. The `_partially_consume_prefix` function is likely responsible for this issue due to its involvement in consuming the prefix and handling indentation-related logic.

The potential error in the function seems to be related to how it accumulates and processes whitespace characters (spaces and tabs) and newline characters, as well as how it updates the `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl` variables during prefix consumption.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug include:
1. Inadequate handling of whitespace characters and newline characters, leading to incorrect updates of line and column positions.
2. Lack of appropriate handling for edge cases such as an empty prefix.

To fix the bug, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function should be revised to accurately count spaces, tabs, and newlines, and to update the variables accordingly to correctly consume the prefix up to the specified column. Additionally, the function should handle edge cases such as an empty prefix.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:
                current_line += char
                current_column = 0
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
        else:
            if current_column < column:
                current_line += char
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This revised version of the function handles whitespace characters and newline characters correctly, updates the `current_line` and `current_column` based on the specified column, and addresses the handling of edge cases, such as an empty prefix. This corrected version should resolve the bug related to incorrect handling of indentation for tabulated comments following a dedent.
