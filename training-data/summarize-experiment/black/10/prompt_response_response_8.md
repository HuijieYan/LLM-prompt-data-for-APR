The buggy function _partially_consume_prefix is designed to consume a prefix string up to a specified column and return the consumed part and the remaining part of the prefix. However, there are several issues in the implementation that lead to incorrect behavior.

The faulty condition that checks for the column position is causing premature returns in multiple cases. Additionally, the handling of tabs and newlines is incorrect, leading to unexpected behavior. The function also does not handle the case of an empty prefix correctly.

To fix the bug, the condition for checking the column position needs to be corrected. The handling of tabs and newlines should be adjusted to properly calculate the column position. Additionally, the function should explicitly handle the case of an empty prefix.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if current_column >= column:  # New condition to check if the column is reached
            break  # Return the consumed part and the remaining part of the prefix
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # Newline encountered
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # Other character encountered
            pass
    return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]  # Return the consumed part and the remaining part of the prefix
```

This corrected version specifically checks if the column has been reached before consuming the prefix and adjusts the current column position based on the encountered characters. It also handles newlines correctly and returns the consumed part and the remaining part of the prefix at the correct indentation level.

Please note that this corrected code assumes that the class `Driver` and the test case `test_comment_indentation` are defined correctly elsewhere.
