Potential Bug Location:
The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is not handling indentation and newline characters consistently, leading to incorrect behavior.

Reasons for the Bug:
The function fails to correctly handle different types of indentation, spaces, tabs, and newline characters. It is prematurely returning or failing to construct the correct `res` value in some cases. This inconsistency in handling different types of characters is leading to incorrect results.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Rewrite the logic for handling indentation, spaces, tabs, and newline characters to ensure consistent behavior.
2. Thoroughly test the function with various input prefixes and column values to verify its correctness and consistency.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False

    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                # Handle other characters
                current_line += char

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This revised version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function addresses the inconsistency in handling different types of characters and ensures that the function behaves consistently and returns the expected results. Thorough testing with various input prefixes and column values is recommended to validate the correctness and consistency of the updated function.
