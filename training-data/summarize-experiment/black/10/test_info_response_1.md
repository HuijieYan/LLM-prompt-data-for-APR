The error message is indicating an AssertionError in the `assertFormatEqual` function that is part of the `test_comment_indentation` test case. The expected contents are not equal to the actual contents.

The relevant portions of the test function `test_comment_indentation` are the lines containing `contents_tab` and `contents_spc`, the calls to `assertFormatEqual`, and the comparison of the expected and actual contents.

In the test function, the contents are set for both tab and space indentation formats, and then compared using the `assertFormatEqual` function.

The error message shows that the `assertFormatEqual` function failed with an AssertionError. The specific error message shows a comparison between the expected and actual contents. The comparison highlights that there is a difference in the indentation and positioning of the comment in the contents.

Based on the error message, it appears that the issue may be related to the logic/code in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function mentioned at the beginning of this exercise.

A careful inspection of the function indicates logic for handling characters like spaces, tabs, and new lines as part of the code parsing process. For instance, conditions like `if char == ' '` and `if char == '\t'` are used to track the current column position. 

This logical inconsistency in handling different characters could be leading to the error. Specifically, it's possible that the function is not correctly handling the mixed indentation formats, which results in the misalignment of the comment when comparing the tab and space indentation contents.

An in-depth analysis of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is required to identify the specific issue and correct it. This may involve carefully examining and debugging the function and the logic used to consume and process the prefix.

In summary, based on the contents of the test function and the error message, it appears that the issue is related to the incorrect handling of indentation formats within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. Further analysis and debugging of the function are needed to resolve the problem.
