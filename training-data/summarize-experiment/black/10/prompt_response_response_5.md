Based on the provided information, the potential error location within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function is the handling of whitespace characters (spaces and tabs) and newline characters, as well as the way it calculates the current column position.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle whitespace characters and newline characters correctly, leading to incorrect updates of the `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl` variables. Additionally, the edge case of an empty prefix is not handled properly.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be revised to accurately count spaces, tabs, and newlines and update the variables accordingly to correctly consume the prefix up to the specified column. This might involve revising the logic for handling whitespace characters and newline characters within the loop to ensure proper tracking of the consumed prefix.

Here is the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                lines.append(current_line + char)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif wait_for_nl:
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = char
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
            current_line += char
        else:
            current_line += char

    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
        res = ''.join(lines)
        return res, prefix[len(res):]

    lines.append(current_line)
    return ''.join(lines), ""
```

This revised version of the function should address the issue by correctly handling the whitespace characters, newline characters, and the specified column. The logic for consuming the prefix has been adjusted to ensure proper tracking and updating of the variables.
