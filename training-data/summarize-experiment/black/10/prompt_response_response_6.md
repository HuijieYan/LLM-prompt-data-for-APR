There are several issues with the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

1. The condition for checking if the current column is less than the specified column is incorrect, resulting in premature returning of consumed lines.
2. The function does not handle the case of an empty prefix correctly.
3. Improper handling of tabs and newlines leads to unexpected behavior.

To fix these issues, we need to revise the logic of the function. First, we should correct the condition for checking the column, ensuring that it properly handles indentation levels. Second, we need to handle the case of an empty prefix explicitly. Finally, we should adjust the logic to correctly handle tabs and newlines.

Here's the revised version of the function that addresses the identified issues:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n' or (char == ' ' and current_column >= column):
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # Adjust column for tabs
        elif char == '\n':
            if not current_line.strip():
                lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            current_line += char
            wait_for_nl = True

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these changes, the function should now handle the indentation correctly, handle empty prefixes, and properly consume the prefix according to the specified column.

Please replace the original `_partially_consume_prefix` function with the provided revised version to address the identified issues.
