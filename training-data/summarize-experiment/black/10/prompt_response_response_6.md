Based on the observed test case and error message, it seems that the issue is related to incorrect indentation for tabulated comments after a dedent. The function `_partially_consume_prefix` processes the input prefix string character by character, building up lines of text until a certain column width is reached. It then returns the accumulated lines and the remaining unparsed portion of the input prefix.

The bug appears to be related to how the function handles different types of indentation (spaces, tabs) and newline characters. This is evident from the inconsistent behavior observed in the test cases and the mismatched expected and actual output.

To fix this bug, it may be necessary to carefully review and possibly rewrite the logic for handling indentation, spaces, tabs, and newline characters within the function. Thorough testing with various input prefixes and column values will be necessary to ensure that the function behaves consistently and accurately returns the expected results.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                current_line += char
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
                current_line += char
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column += 4
                current_line += char
            elif char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line + char)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
                current_line += char
                
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This revised version of the function restructures the logic for handling indentation, spaces, tabs, and newline characters by explicitly tracking the `wait_for_nl` condition and appending characters to the `current_line` accordingly. Thorough testing should be conducted to ensure that the revised function behaves consistently and accurately returns the expected results.
