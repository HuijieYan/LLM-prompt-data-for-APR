It appears that the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is meant to consume a prefix string up to a certain column and return the consumed portion and the remaining portion. However, based on the given variable logs and the code, it seems that the function may not be correctly handling certain cases.

Let's analyze each buggy case based on the corresponding input and variable runtime values provided.

### Buggy case 1
In this case, the input prefix is `'    # comment\n    '` and the column is `8`. The variable logs before the function returns show that `current_line` has captured `'    # comment\n'`, `current_column` is `4`, and `wait_for_nl` is `True`. The value of `char` at this point is `'\n'`.

Based on the code, `current_line` accumulates characters from the prefix string until either a space, tab, newline, or the specific column is reached. Upon encountering the newline character, it checks if `wait_for_nl` is `True`. If true, it adds the current line to `lines` and resets the `current_line` and `current_column`. In this case, the `if` condition for adding the current line to `lines` is not triggered, so the behavior may not be as expected.

### Buggy case 2
For this case, the input prefix is an empty string `''` and the column is `4`. The variable logs show that `current_line` is an empty string, `current_column` is `0`, and `wait_for_nl` is `False`.

In this scenario, the prefix being empty implies that the loop does not iterate over any characters. The final state of the variables matches the initial state, suggesting a failure to handle an empty prefix correctly.

### Buggy case 3
Here, the input prefix is `'\t# comment\n\t'` and the column is `2`. The variable logs indicate that `current_line` captures `'\t# comment\n'`, `current_column` is `1`, `wait_for_nl` is `True`, and `char` is `'\n'`.

Similar to the first case, the behavior in handling the newline character and resetting the variables may not be as expected.

### Buggy case 4
For an empty prefix and a column of `1`, the variables `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl` maintain their initial values. This aligns with the observation made in buggy case 2, where the function is not handling an empty prefix appropriately.

### Buggy case 5
In this case, the prefix is `'\t\t# comment\n\t'` and the column is `2`. The variable logs before the return show that `lines` capture `['\t\t# comment\n']`, `current_line` captures `'\t'`, `current_column` is `1`, `wait_for_nl` is `False`, and `char` is `'\t'`. This particular case reveals that the behavior of the function with respect to tabs and their impact on the line and column count may not be correct.

### Buggy case 6
The input prefix here is `'        # comment\n    '` and the column is `8`. The variable logs indicate that `lines` capture `['        # comment\n']`, `current_line` captures `'    '`, `current_column` is `4`, `wait_for_nl` is `False`, and `char` is `' '`. Similar to the other cases, the function seems to have issues handling spaces and tabs when counting the line and column positions.

Based on the evaluation of these cases, it seems that the function is not handling whitespace characters (spaces and tabs) and newline characters correctly, which leads to incorrect updates of the `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl` variables. Additionally, the edge case of an empty prefix is not handled properly.

To address these issues, the function needs to be revised to accurately count spaces, tabs, and newlines and update the variables accordingly to correctly consume the prefix up to the specified column. This might involve revising the logic for handling whitespace characters and newline characters within the loop to ensure proper tracking of the consumed prefix.
