The function `_partially_consume_prefix` takes in two input parameters: `prefix`, which is a string, and `column`, which is an integer. The function processes the `prefix` string character by character, building up lines of text until a certain column width is reached.

The expected output for the function corresponds to several test cases. In each case, the expected output includes the values and types of specific variables within the function before it returns. These variables are `lines`, `current_line`, `current_column`, `wait_for_nl`, `char`, and `res`.

The function initializes `lines` as an empty list, `current_line` as an empty string, `current_column` as 0, and `wait_for_nl` as False. The function then iterates through the characters of the `prefix` string, processing each character according to specific conditions. The `current_line` is built up character by character, and the `current_column` is updated based on the type of character encountered (space, tab, newline, or other character). The `wait_for_nl` flag is used to determine when to check for a newline character to trigger further processing.

Based on the expected output for each test case, it is evident that the function updates the variables `lines`, `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl` based on the logic within the loop. When specific conditions are met, the function returns a tuple containing the accumulated lines and the remaining unparsed portion of the `prefix` string.

In summary, the function iterates through the characters of the `prefix` string, building up lines until a certain column width is reached, and then returns the accumulated lines and the remaining unparsed portion of the input `prefix`. The logic of the function is centered around character processing and the management of variables such as `lines`, `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl` to achieve this behavior.
