The `_partially_consume_prefix` function takes in two input parameters, `prefix` (a string) and `column` (an integer). It initializes several variables including `lines` (an empty list), `current_line` (an empty string), `current_column` (initialized to 0), and `wait_for_nl` (initialized to False).

The function then iterates through each character in the `prefix` string and updates the `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl` variables based on the character. It also appends lines to the `lines` list when a newline character is encountered and a condition is met.

Finally, the function returns a tuple containing the joined lines and the remaining prefix after the consumed part.

By examining the expected variable values before the function returns for each test case, we can see that the function's logic of consuming the input prefix and updating the variables aligns with the expected outputs. However, there might be an issue with the way the function handles the case where `current_column` is less than the input `column`, as this condition is not explicitly captured in the expected outputs.

In summary, the function consumes a part of the input `prefix` string based on the input `column` value and updates internal variables accordingly before returning the consumed part and the remaining prefix.
