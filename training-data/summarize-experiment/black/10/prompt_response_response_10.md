Based on the analysis of the test function `test_comment_indentation` and the provided runtime variables and types in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, it is evident that the bug occurs due to incorrect handling of whitespace characters (spaces and tabs) and newline characters, leading to the misalignment of comments when comparing tab and space indentation formats.

The specific issues identified are:
1. Inconsistent handling of whitespace characters and their impact on the line and column count.
2. Incorrect behavior with respect to tabs, leading to incorrect line and column positions.
3. Improper handling of the edge case of an empty prefix.

To address these issues and fix the bug, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function needs to be revised to accurately count spaces, tabs, and newlines, and update the variables accordingly to correctly consume the prefix up to the specified column. Additionally, the function needs to handle the edge case of an empty prefix more effectively.

Here is the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            current_column = 0
        else:
            if current_column >= column:
                return ''.join(lines), current_line + prefix[len(current_line):]
            current_line += char
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the revised function:
- The `wait_for_nl` flag is removed as it is unnecessary for the correct functioning of the function.
- The logic for updating the `current_column` based on spaces, tabs, and newlines is simplified and corrected.
- The function directly checks if the `current_column` has reached or exceeded the input `column` and returns the consumed part and the remaining prefix.

This revised function should effectively address the identified issues and resolve the bug related to incorrect handling of indentation for tabulated comments following a dedent in codebases that use tabs when using the Black Python code formatter.
