There appears to be an issue with the `_partially_consume_prefix` function, which is used in the context of code formatting. The function is supposed to process a given prefix string, constructing lines of text and returning the remaining unparsed portion of the prefix. However, based on the test case and the error message, it seems that the function fails to correctly handle the indentation of comments after a dedent, especially when using tabs for indentation.

The bug seems to be related to how the function handles indentation and newline characters, particularly when processing tabulated comments after a dedent. The function's logic for handling indentation, spaces, tabs, and newline characters appears to be inconsistent or incomplete, leading to incorrect results.

To address this bug, the function's logic for handling different types of indentation and newline characters needs to be carefully reviewed and possibly rewritten. This may involve ensuring that the function accurately tracks and adjusts the current_column value based on the type of character encountered, handles tabulated comments after a dedent, and correctly constructs the output lines. Thorough testing with various input prefixes and column values will be necessary to verify the fixed behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            if char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
            elif char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

Please note that the correction includes adjustments to handle tab characters and properly calculate the current column position, as well as additional handling of newline characters to ensure correct line construction.

By using this corrected function, the issue should be resolved, and the function should behave consistently and accurately return the expected results.
