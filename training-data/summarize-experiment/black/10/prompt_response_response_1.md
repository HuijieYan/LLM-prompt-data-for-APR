Based on the provided information, it appears that the issue is related to the incorrect handling of mixed indentation formats within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. The function is not correctly handling whitespace characters (spaces and tabs) and newline characters, leading to incorrect updates of the `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl` variables. Additionally, the edge case of an empty prefix is not handled properly. 

To fix the bug, the `_partially_consume_prefix` function needs to be revised to accurately count spaces, tabs, and newlines and update the variables accordingly to correctly consume the prefix up to the specified column. This may involve revising the logic for handling whitespace characters and newline characters within the loop to ensure proper tracking of the consumed prefix.

Here is the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
            current_line += char
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming tab width as 4, adjust if necessary
            current_line += char
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
            current_line += char
    
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In the corrected code, the handling of whitespace characters and newline characters has been revised to ensure proper tracking of the consumed prefix and accurate updates of the variables. The logic for updating `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl` has been adjusted to address the issues identified in the buggy function. This revised version should resolve the bug and improve the functionality of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function.
