The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is expected to process a prefix string character by character until a certain column width is reached, and then return the accumulated lines and the remaining unparsed portion of the input `prefix`. However, it is failing to correctly handle different types of indentation and newline characters, resulting in inconsistent behavior and incorrect return values in some cases.

Upon examining the function's logic and the observed variable values, it is evident that the function is not handling tabs, spaces, and newline characters consistently. This inconsistency is leading to premature returns or incorrect construction of the `res` value.

To fix this issue, the logic for handling indentation, spaces, tabs, and newline characters needs to be carefully reviewed and possibly rewritten. Thorough testing with various input prefixes and column values will be necessary to ensure that the function behaves consistently and accurately returns the expected results.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True

        if current_column >= column:
            res = ''.join(lines)
            return res, prefix[len(res):]

    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, the handling of tabs, spaces, and newline characters has been revised to ensure consistent behavior based on the specified column width.

This revised code addresses the issues with inconsistent handling of indentation and newline characters, which should resolve the bug encountered in the original function. Thorough testing is recommended to validate the behavior of the corrected function.
