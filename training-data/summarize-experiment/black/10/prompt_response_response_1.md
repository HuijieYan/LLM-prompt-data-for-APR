The bug in the `_partially_consume_prefix` function lies in the incorrect handling of the column condition and unexpected behavior when encountering tabs and newlines. Additionally, the function does not handle the case of an empty prefix correctly.

To address this bug, the following approaches can be taken:
1. Update the logic for checking the column condition to accurately track the indentation level and handle tabs and spaces consistently.
2. Ensure that the function handles the case of an empty prefix correctly by returning an empty string and the prefix itself.

Here's the revised version of the function that resolves the mentioned issues:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if char == ' ':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_line += char
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            if current_column < column:
                current_line += char
                current_column += 1
            else:
                lines.append(current_line)
                return ''.join(lines), prefix[len(''.join(lines)):]
    lines.append(current_line)
    return ''.join(lines), ""
```

This revised function addresses the issues by properly tracking the column position, handling tabs and spaces consistently, and correctly handling the case of an empty prefix.

The updated function can serve as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version and should resolve the mentioned bug.

Please note that the code provided assumes the context of the class where the function is used, and the necessary adjustments should be made accordingly.
