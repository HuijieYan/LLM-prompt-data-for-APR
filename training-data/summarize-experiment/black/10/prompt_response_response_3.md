Based on the observed runtime variables and types, as well as the expected parameters and return values, the buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is failing to handle different types of indentation and newline characters consistently. This inconsistency in behavior results in incorrect return values, leading to the failed test cases and the associated error message.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to carefully review and possibly rewrite the logic for handling indentation, spaces, tabs, and newline characters. Thorough testing with various input prefixes and column values will also be necessary to ensure that the function behaves consistently and accurately returns the expected results.

Here is the corrected version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version, the logic for handling tab characters has been updated to ensure consistent behavior with the expected column width. Now, the function handles tab characters by adjusting the `current_column` to the nearest multiple of 4, as tabs typically represent a width of 4 spaces.

By addressing the inconsistent handling of indentation and newline characters, the function should now behave consistently and accurately return the expected results, resolving the bug that caused the failed test cases.
