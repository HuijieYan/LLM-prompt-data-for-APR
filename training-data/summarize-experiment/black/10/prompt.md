## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to consume a prefix string up to a specified column and return the consumed part and the remaining part of the prefix. However, there are several issues in the implementation that lead to incorrect behavior.

Buggy case 1:
The input prefix is `'    # comment\n    '` and the column is `8`. The current_line is `'    # comment\n'`, and the current_column is `4`. The `wait_for_nl` variable is set to `True` and the `char` is `'\n'`.

When we look at the code, we see that the condition to check if the column is reached is incorrect. It checks if the current line is not empty and the current column is less than the specified column. However, in this case, the current column is 4, which is less than 8, so it should not have returned at this point. This proves that the conditional logic for checking the column is incorrect.

Buggy case 2:
The input prefix is an empty string and the column is 4. The current_line is an empty string, and the current_column is 0. The `wait_for_nl` variable is `False`.

In this case, since the input prefix is empty, the function should return an empty string and the prefix itself. However, the function does not handle this case correctly, which indicates a flaw in its logic.

Buggy case 3:
The input prefix is `'\t# comment\n\t'` and the column is 2. The current_line is `'\t# comment\n'`, and the current_column is 1. The `wait_for_nl` variable is `True` and the `char` is `'\n'`.

Similar to the first case, the condition for checking the column is faulty, as it returned prematurely when the column condition was not met.

Buggy case 4:
The input prefix is an empty string and the column is 1. The current_line is an empty string, and the current_column is 0. The `wait_for_nl` variable is `False`.

This case should also return an empty string and the prefix itself, but the function does not handle it correctly.

Buggy case 5:
The input prefix is `'\t\t# comment\n\t'` and the column is 2. The current_line is `'\t'`, and the current_column is 1. The `wait_for_nl` variable is `False` and the `char` is `'\t'`.

In this case, the function adds the current line to the lines list before the column condition is checked. This results in the premature consumption of the prefix.

Buggy case 6:
The input prefix is `'        # comment\n    '` and the column is 8. The current_line is `'    '`, and the current_column is 4. The `wait_for_nl` variable is `False` and the `char` is `' '`.

Similar to the previous cases, the condition for checking the column is incorrect, as it does not properly handle the indentation.

In summary, the issues are related to incorrect handling of the column condition and unexpected behavior when encountering tabs and newlines. Additionally, the function does not handle the case of an empty prefix correctly. These are the areas that need to be addressed and fixed in the code.



## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

Summary:
The function _partially_consume_prefix takes two input parameters, prefix (a string) and column (an integer). It iterates through the characters in the prefix string and builds up lines of text and keeps track of the current column position. It also has a flag, wait_for_nl, to check for new lines. The function returns a tuple consisting of the consumed lines and the remaining unparsed prefix.

During execution, the function initializes the lines list and current_line string to an empty list and empty string, respectively. It initializes the current_column to 0 and wait_for_nl to False. Then, it iterates through each character of the input prefix and updates the current_line, current_column, and wait_for_nl variables. The function keeps checking for spaces, tabs, and new lines, updating the variables accordingly.

In the expected test cases, various configurations of prefix strings and column values are considered, and the expected values of lines, current_line, current_column, wait_for_nl, char, and res variables are provided before the function returns. Based on these expected values and the provided source code, the behavior and logic of the function can be analyzed in detail.



# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
Indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent
```

## The associated detailed issue description
```text
Operating system: Ubuntu 18.04
Python version: 3.6.3
Black version: master

Thank you @ambv for this library. When trying to run this on a codebase that uses tabs, indentation for comments past depth 0 is changed incorrectly after a dedent. Sample input (NB tabs):

if 1:
	if 2:
		pass
	# This comment should be indented the same as the next line
	pass
Black reformats this to:

if 1:
    if 2:
        pass
        # This comment should be indented the same as the next line
    pass
Note that this only happens when the input file uses tabs.
```
