Please correct the malfunctioning function provided below by using the relevant information listed to address this bug. Then, produce a revised version of the function that resolves the issue. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
None
```

The following is the buggy function that you need to fix:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line

```

## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

Looking at the function and the provided variable runtime values and types, we can start by examining the function's logic and how it aligns with the observed variable values.

In the first buggy case, the input prefix is `'    # comment\n    '` and the column is 8. When we check the variables before the function returns, we see that `lines` is an empty list, `current_line` is `'    # comment\n'`, `current_column` is 4, and `wait_for_nl` is True. The character at this point is `'\n'`, and the result `res` is an empty string.

As we look at the code, we see that the function iterates through each character in the `prefix`, incrementing the `current_column` value for each space or tab encountered. When it encounters a newline character, it checks if it is waiting for a newline. If it is, and the condition is met, it returns a slice of the input prefix.

In the second buggy case, the input prefix is an empty string and the column is 4. Before the function returns, `lines` is still an empty list, `current_line` is an empty string, `current_column` is 0, and `wait_for_nl` is False. Here, it seems that the function failed to return the expected result as there is no meaningful `prefix` to return.

Continuing with the third buggy case, the input prefix is `'\t# comment\n\t'` with a column of 2. Before the function returns, `lines` is an empty list, `current_line` is `'\t# comment\n'`, `current_column` is 1, and `wait_for_nl` is True. The character at this point is `'\n'`, and the result `res` is an empty string. Based on the given logic, it should have returned `('')` as the result instead of an empty string.

In the fourth buggy case, the prefix is an empty string and the column is 1. Before the function returns, all the variables indicate that it should have returned an empty string, but the result might be incorrect.

The fifth buggy case has the prefix `'\t\t# comment\n\t'` with a column of 2. The variables show that it constructed a list with a single line and a partially constructed current line, which seems to align with the function's logic.

Lastly, in the sixth buggy case, the prefix is `'        # comment\n    '` with a column of 8. The observed variable values show that it constructed a list with a single line and a partially constructed current line, which also aligns with the function's logic.

From these observations, it seems like the function is failing to correctly handle different types of indentation and newline characters. There is inconsistency in the behavior of the function, particularly in how it handles tabs and spaces. It's likely that the function is prematurely returning or failing to construct the correct `res` value in some cases.

In conclusion, to fix this function, it may be necessary to carefully review and possibly rewrite the logic for handling indentation, spaces, tabs, and newline characters. Additionally, thorough testing with various input prefixes and column values will be necessary to ensure that the function behaves consistently and accurately returns the expected results.



## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

The function `_partially_consume_prefix` takes in two input parameters: `prefix`, which is a string, and `column`, which is an integer. The function processes the `prefix` string character by character, building up lines of text until a certain column width is reached.

The expected output for the function corresponds to several test cases. In each case, the expected output includes the values and types of specific variables within the function before it returns. These variables are `lines`, `current_line`, `current_column`, `wait_for_nl`, `char`, and `res`.

The function initializes `lines` as an empty list, `current_line` as an empty string, `current_column` as 0, and `wait_for_nl` as False. The function then iterates through the characters of the `prefix` string, processing each character according to specific conditions. The `current_line` is built up character by character, and the `current_column` is updated based on the type of character encountered (space, tab, newline, or other character). The `wait_for_nl` flag is used to determine when to check for a newline character to trigger further processing.

Based on the expected output for each test case, it is evident that the function updates the variables `lines`, `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl` based on the logic within the loop. When specific conditions are met, the function returns a tuple containing the accumulated lines and the remaining unparsed portion of the `prefix` string.

In summary, the function iterates through the characters of the `prefix` string, building up lines until a certain column width is reached, and then returns the accumulated lines and the remaining unparsed portion of the input `prefix`. The logic of the function is centered around character processing and the management of variables such as `lines`, `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl` to achieve this behavior.



# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
Indentation is incorrectly changed for tabulated comments after a dedent
```

## The associated detailed issue description
```text
Operating system: Ubuntu 18.04
Python version: 3.6.3
Black version: master

Thank you @ambv for this library. When trying to run this on a codebase that uses tabs, indentation for comments past depth 0 is changed incorrectly after a dedent. Sample input (NB tabs):

if 1:
	if 2:
		pass
	# This comment should be indented the same as the next line
	pass
Black reformats this to:

if 1:
    if 2:
        pass
        # This comment should be indented the same as the next line
    pass
Note that this only happens when the input file uses tabs.
```
