Based on the analysis, the potential error locations within the problematic function are the conditional logic for checking the column and the handling of different types of indentation characters.

The bug is occurring because the function incorrectly checks the column condition and prematurely returns the result. Additionally, the function does not handle empty prefix strings properly and has unexpected behavior when encountering tabs and newlines.

To fix the bug, the following approaches could be considered:
1. Revise the conditional logic for checking the column to ensure it correctly handles different types of indentation characters.
2. Update the logic to properly handle empty prefix strings and unexpected behavior when encountering tabs and newlines.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class Driver(object):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
        lines = []
        current_line = ""
        current_column = 0
        wait_for_nl = False
        for char in prefix:
            current_line += char
            if wait_for_nl:
                if char == '\n':
                    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                        res = ''.join(lines)
                        return res, prefix[len(res):]

                    lines.append(current_line)
                    current_line = ""
                    current_column = 0
                    wait_for_nl = False
            elif char == ' ':
                current_column += 1
            elif char == '\t':
                current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
            elif char == '\n':
                current_column = 0
            else:
                wait_for_nl = True

        return ''.join(lines) + current_line, ""
```

This revised version of the function addresses the issues related to checking the column condition and handling different types of indentation characters. It also handles empty prefix strings and unexpected behavior when encountering tabs and newlines. The corrected function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
