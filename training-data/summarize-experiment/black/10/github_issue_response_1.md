## Summary of the GitHub issue

The issue at hand pertains to the incorrect handling of indentation for tabulated comments following a dedent in codebases that use tabs. The problem occurs specifically when utilizing Black, a Python code formatter, on a codebase that utilizes tabs. 

The affected system is Ubuntu 18.04, running Python version 3.6.3 and Black version "master". 

The scenario described involves an if-else block with nested tabs, along with a comment that is expected to be indented at the same level as the subsequent line of code. However, after applying Black's formatting, the comment's indentation is altered incorrectly.

It is crucial to note that this issue exclusively arises when tabs are employed in the input file. 

This bug report emphasizes that the incorrect reformatting of tabulated comments post dedent is a pressing concern, and resolving this issue would greatly enhance the functionality and accuracy of code formatting in Black for codebases that rely on tabs.
