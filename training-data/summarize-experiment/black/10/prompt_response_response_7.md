Based on the analysis of the function and the test case, it appears that the issue is related to the incorrect handling of indentation formats (spaces and tabs) within the `_partially_consume_prefix` function. The function is not updating the variables `current_line`, `current_column`, and `wait_for_nl` accurately when encountering different types of indentation and newline characters.

To fix the bug, the function `_partially_consume_prefix` needs to be revised to accurately count spaces, tabs, and newlines and update the variables accordingly to correctly consume the prefix up to the specified column. Additionally, the function should handle the edge case of an empty prefix appropriately.

Here is the revised version of the `_partially_consume_prefix` function that resolves the issues:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    for char in prefix:
        if current_column >= column:
            break
        current_line += char
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4  # Assuming 4 spaces equivalent to 1 tab
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

The revised function addresses the issues by accurately updating `current_line` and `current_column` based on the encountered characters. It also correctly handles the newline character and the edge case of an empty prefix. This corrected version ensures that the function correctly consumes the prefix up to the specified column and returns the consumed part and the remaining prefix. This revised function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
