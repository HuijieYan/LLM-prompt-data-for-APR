The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to process a prefix string character by character, building up lines of text until a certain column width is reached, and then returning the accumulated lines and the remaining unparsed portion of the input prefix. However, the function currently exhibits inconsistency in handling different types of indentation and newline characters, leading to incorrect results in some cases.

Based on the observed variable values and types, it appears that the function is failing to handle tabs, spaces, and newline characters consistently, resulting in premature returns or incorrect construction of the result value.

To fix the bug, it will be necessary to carefully review and possibly rewrite the logic for handling indentation, spaces, tabs, and newline characters within the function. Thorough testing with various input prefixes and column values will be necessary to ensure that the function behaves consistently and accurately returns the expected results.

Here is the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4  # Adjust for tab width
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_column < column:  # Check indentation before adding the newline
                res = ''.join(lines)
                return res, prefix[len(res):]
            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
            wait_for_nl = False
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

In this corrected version of the function, additional logic has been added to handle the behavior of tabs, spaces, and newline characters more consistently. Specifically, the handling of tabs has been adjusted to ensure proper column width calculations, and the condition for checking indentation before adding a newline has been modified to align with the expected behavior.

By implementing these changes, the function should now behave consistently and accurately return the expected results for various input prefixes and column values. Thorough testing is recommended to validate the correctness of the revised function.
