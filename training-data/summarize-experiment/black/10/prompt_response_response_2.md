The buggy function `_partially_consume_prefix` is designed to process a prefix string character by character and accumulate lines until a certain column width is reached. However, it fails to handle different types of indentation and newline characters consistently, leading to incorrect output.

The observed behavior indicates that the function is prematurely returning the result or failing to construct the correct result in some cases. This inconsistency is likely due to how the function handles spaces, tabs, and newlines.

To address this bug, it may be necessary to carefully review and potentially rewrite the logic for handling indentation, spaces, tabs, and newline characters within the function. Thorough testing with various input prefixes and column values will also be necessary to ensure consistent and accurate behavior.

Here is the revised version of the function that resolves the issue:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        if char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if wait_for_nl:  # Process empty line when waiting for newline
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]
                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
            else:  # Unexpected empty line, reset current_column
                current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
        current_line += char

    if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
        res = ''.join(lines)
        return res, prefix[len(res):]
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

This revised function includes additional checks to ensure consistent handling of spaces, tabs, and newline characters. It also refines the logic for processing empty lines and properly accumulating the lines. Thorough testing will be necessary to validate the correctness of this fix.
