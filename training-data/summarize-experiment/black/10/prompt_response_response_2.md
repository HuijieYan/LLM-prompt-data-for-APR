The bug in the function `_partially_consume_prefix` is related to incorrect handling of the column condition and unexpected behavior when encountering tabs and newlines. Additionally, the function does not handle the case of an empty prefix correctly.

Specifically, the condition to check if the column is reached is incorrect, as it returns prematurely when the column condition is not met. This leads to premature consumption of the prefix and incorrect output.

To fix this bug, we need to revise the logic for checking the column condition and handling tabs, spaces, and newlines. Additionally, we should also address the case of an empty prefix to ensure correct behavior in all scenarios.

Here is the corrected code for the `_partially_consume_prefix` function:

```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column = (current_column // 4 + 1) * 4
        elif char == '\n':
            if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                res = ''.join(lines) + current_line
                return res, prefix[len(res):]

            lines.append(current_line)
            current_line = ""
            current_column = 0
        else:
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line
```

With these corrections, the function should now handle the column condition correctly and produce the expected output for the given test cases.
