Please correct the malfunctioning function provided below by using the relevant information listed to address this bug. Then, produce a revised version of the function that resolves the issue. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
from typing import Any, Callable, Collection, Dict, Generic, Iterable, Iterator, List, Optional, Pattern, Set, Tuple, Type, TypeVar, Union
```

The following is the buggy function that you need to fix:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line

        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

Looking at the code, we see several if-else conditions and value updates inside the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. Let's analyze the buggy cases based on the given input parameters and variable values:

### Buggy Case 1:
The input parameter `current_line` has `depth=0`. Inside the function, `max_allowed` is updated to 2 based on this depth value. The `first_leaf` is `Leaf(AT, '@')`, and `before` is initially set to 0. Finally, `is_decorator` is set to True.

### Buggy Case 2:
The input parameter `current_line` has `depth=0`. The previous line is `Line(depth=0, leaves=[Leaf(AT, '@'), Leaf(NAME, 'property')])`. Inside the function, `max_allowed` is updated to 2 based on the depth value. The `first_leaf` is `Leaf(153, '# TODO: X')`, and `before` is initially set to 0.

### Buggy Case 3:
Similar to Case 1, the input parameter `current_line` has `depth=0`. It is a decorator, and the previous line is `Line(depth=0, leaves=[Leaf(153, '# TODO: X')])`. Inside the function, `max_allowed` is updated to 2 based on the depth value. The `first_leaf` is `Leaf(AT, '@')`, and `before` is initially set to 0.

### Buggy Case 4:
Again, the input parameter `current_line` has `depth=0`. The previous line is `Line(depth=0, leaves=[Leaf(AT, '@'), Leaf(NAME, 'property')])`. Inside the function, `max_allowed` is updated to 2 based on the depth value. The `first_leaf` is `Leaf(153, '# TODO: Y')`, and `before` is initially set to 0.

### Buggy Case 5:
The input parameter `current_line` has `depth=0`. The previous line is `Line(depth=0, leaves=[Leaf(153, '# TODO: Y')])`. Inside the function, `max_allowed` is updated to 2 based on the depth value. The `first_leaf` is `Leaf(153, '# TODO: Z')`, and `before` is initially set to 0.

### Buggy Case 6:
Similar to Case 3, the input parameter `current_line` has `depth=0`. It is a decorator, and the previous line is `Line(depth=0, leaves=[Leaf(153, '# TODO: Z')])`. Inside the function, `max_allowed` is updated to 2 based on the depth value. The `first_leaf` is `Leaf(AT, '@')`, and `before` is initially set to 0.

### Buggy Case 7:
The input parameter `current_line` has `depth=0` and `is_def=True`. The previous line is `Line(depth=0, leaves=[Leaf(AT, '@'), Leaf(NAME, 'property')])`. Inside the function, `max_allowed` is updated to 2 based on the depth value. The `first_leaf` is `Leaf(NAME, 'def')`, and `before` is initially set to 0. Additionally, `self.previous_defs` is updated to `[0]`.

### Buggy Case 8:
The input parameter `current_line` has `depth=1`. The previous line is `Line(depth=0, leaves=[Leaf(NAME, 'def'), Leaf(NAME, 'foo'), ...])` and since `depth=1`, `max_allowed` is set to 1. The `first_leaf` is `Leaf(NAME, 'pass')`, and `before` is initially set to 0.

Upon reviewing these cases, the function seems to work correctly based on the provided inputs and variable values. However, I noticed that the logic within the if-else conditions may not be evaluating the intended scenarios as expected.

To troubleshoot this issue, I would closely examine the logic behind the conditions of `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield`. It's also crucial to ensure that the `self.previous_defs` list is being updated accurately.

By closely reviewing these specific sections of the code and comparing them to the provided input values, it should be possible to identify the root cause of these test failures. Further testing and analysis may also be required to ensure the function behaves as intended in all possible scenarios.



## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

The `_maybe_empty_lines` function takes in a `current_line` object of type `Line` and returns a tuple of two integers representing the number of empty lines to be inserted before and after the current line.

1. It starts by setting `max_allowed` to 1, but if `current_line.depth` is equal to 0, then `max_allowed` is set to 2.
   
2. If `current_line.leaves` is not empty, it gets the number of newlines in the prefix of the first leaf, then sets `before` to the minimum between the number of newlines and `max_allowed` and finally sets the prefix to an empty string.

3. If `current_line.leaves` is empty, `before` is set to 0.

4. It establishes the value of `depth` as the value of `current_line.depth`.
   
5. It then iterates through `self.previous_defs` and pops values until a condition is not met. Respectively, `before` is set to 1 if `depth` is truthy, otherwise, it is set to 2.

6. Depending on the type of `current_line` (such as decorator, def, class, etc.) and the relationship with the previous line, it sets the appropriate number of newlines to be added before and after the current line.

7. The final return is `before` to indicate how many empty lines are to be added before the current line, and 0 to indicate that there should not be any empty lines added after the current line.
