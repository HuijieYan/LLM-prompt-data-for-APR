Please correct the malfunctioning function provided below by using the relevant information listed to address this bug. Then, produce a revised version of the function that resolves the issue. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
from typing import Any, Callable, Collection, Dict, Generic, Iterable, Iterator, List, Optional, Pattern, Set, Tuple, Type, TypeVar, Union
```

The following is the buggy function that you need to fix:
```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0

## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

Based on the provided variable runtime values, we can see that the function `_maybe_empty_lines` takes in a `current_line` as a parameter and operates based on its properties and other internal variable values.

In the first case, the input parameter `current_line` is of type `Line` with a depth of 0 and contains leaves with a decorator. In this case, the `max_allowed` variable is correctly set to 2 and the `before` variable is correctly set to 0. This aligns with the code where `max_allowed` is set to 2 if the `current_line.depth == 0` and `before` is set based on the prefix count of the first leaf.

In the second case, the input parameter `current_line` is of type `Line` with a depth of 0 and contains leaves with a comment. The `max_allowed` and `before` variables are once again correctly set to 2 and 0 respectively, as per the code logic.

In the third case, the input parameter `current_line` is of type `Line` with a depth of 0 and contains leaves with a decorator. The `max_allowed` and `before` variables are once again correctly set to 2 and 0 respectively, as per the code logic.

In the fourth case, the input parameter `current_line` is of type `Line` with a depth of 0 and contains leaves with a comment. The `max_allowed` and `before` variables are once again correctly set to 2 and 0 respectively, as per the code logic.

In the fifth case, the input parameter `current_line` is of type `Line` with a depth of 0 and contains leaves with a comment. The `max_allowed` and `before` variables are correctly set to 2 and 0 respectively, as per the code logic.

In the sixth case, the input parameter `current_line` is of type `Line` with a depth of 0 and contains leaves with a decorator. The `max_allowed` and `before` variables are once again correctly set to 2 and 0 respectively, as per the code logic.

In the seventh case, the input parameter `current_line` is of type `Line` with a depth of 0 and contains leaves indicating a function definition. The `max_allowed` and `before` variables are correctly set to 2 and 0 respectively, as per the code logic. Additionally, the `self.previous_defs` array is correctly updated with the value 0.

In the eighth case, the input parameter `current_line` is of type `Line` with a depth of 1 and contains leaves with a flow control statement. The `max_allowed` variable is set to 1 and the `before` variable is set to 0, which are correct according to the code logic.

From the given variable values and types alongside the provided function code, it's evident that the function is operating as expected based on the input parameters and internal variables. Therefore, the bug may lie in the caller function or the processing of the output of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function, rather than within the function itself.



## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

Analysis Summary:
The function `_maybe_empty_lines` takes a `current_line` as input and returns a Tuple of two integers. The variable `max_allowed` is used to determine the maximum number of empty lines allowed before the current line. This value is updated based on whether `current_line.depth` is 0. If `current_line.leaves` is not empty, it processes the first leaf's extra newlines. Otherwise, it sets `before` to 0. It then iterates over the `self.previous_defs` list and updates `before` based on certain conditions. 

The function then checks various conditions related to line types like decorator, def, class, flow control, and import. Based on these conditions, it returns the number of empty lines before the current line and a flag indicating whether the line is a yield or not.

The comprehensive examination of each test case shows that the function's behavior is coherent with the expected logic. This includes checking if the current line is a decorator, a def, a class, a flow control, and an import. The function also updates the `self.previous_defs` list and handles line depth appropriately.

The function has a clear flow of logic and accurately responds to different scenarios based on the input `current_line` and other related variables. Overall, the core logic of the function revolves around the processing of different line types and the calculation of the number of empty lines allowed before the current line.
