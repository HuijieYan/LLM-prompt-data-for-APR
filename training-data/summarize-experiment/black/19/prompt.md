When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
from typing import Any, Callable, Collection, Dict, Generic, Iterable, Iterator, List, Optional, Pattern, Set, Tuple, Type, TypeVar, Union

The following is the buggy function that you need to fix:
```python

    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)

## Test Functions and Error Messages Summary
The followings are test functions under directory `tests/test_black.py` in the project.
```python
@patch("black.dump_to_file", dump_to_stderr)
def test_comment_in_decorator(self) -> None:
    source, expected = read_data("comments6")
    actual = fs(source)
    self.assertFormatEqual(expected, actual)
    black.assert_equivalent(source, actual)
    black.assert_stable(source, actual, line_length=ll)
```

Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:
The error message points to an assertion failure in the `assertFormatEqual` method of the test. The specific difference between the expected and actual output is highlighted in the error message. The `assertFormatEqual` method compares the expected formatting of the code with the actual formatting, and in this case, there is a difference between the two.

Looking at the test function `test_comment_in_decorator`, it appears that it is reading data from a file named "comments6", and then comparing the actual output of the `fs` function with the expected output. It is using the `assertFormatEqual` method to perform the comparison.

In the actual output, the presence of extra newlines is causing the assertion to fail. Specifically, the error message indicates that there are extra newlines in the actual output compared to the expected output.

Further analysis of the error message shows that the issue is related to the presence of extra newlines in the output, specifically within comments and decorators. It seems that the actual output is including extra newlines in certain places where they should not be, causing the assertion to fail.

This information points to a potential issue with the `fs` function, which is responsible for generating the actual output. It appears that the function is not handling newlines correctly in the context of comments and decorators, leading to the unexpected output and causing the test to fail.

To resolve this issue, the `fs` function should be reviewed and modified to ensure that it generates the correct output without the presence of extra newlines where they are not supposed to be, as indicated by the expected output.



## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

In the provided buggy function code, we have several input cases along with their respective variable runtime values and types. Let's derive conclusions based on these cases:

1. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` takes an instance of the `Line` class as input and returns a tuple of integers.
2. The variable `max_allowed` is initialized with a value of 1 and potentially updated to 2 based on the condition `if current_line.depth == 0`.
3. If `current_line.leaves` is not empty, the function adjusts the value of `before` based on the count of newline characters in the prefix of the first leaf. It then sets the `prefix` of the first leaf to an empty string.
4. The variable `depth` is assigned the value of `current_line.depth`.
5. The function maintains a list of `previous_defs` and updates it based on certain conditions.
6. It checks for various conditions related to the type of the current line and previous line, and returns a tuple depending on these conditions.

Now, let's analyze the specific cases and their expected behavior based on the provided input and output variable values:

### Buggy case 1:
The input `current_line` is a valid decorator (`current_line.is_decorator` is True) with `depth = 0`. In this scenario, the function should return `(1, 0)` as per the last `if` condition. However, the actual output is not consistent. The `before` variable has a value of 0, which is expected.

### Buggy case 2:
The input `current_line` is not a decorator and has `depth = 0`. The `self.previous_line` is a valid decorator, so the function should return `(0, 0)` as per the `if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator` condition. However, the actual output is not consistent. The `before` variable has a value of 0, which is expected.

### Buggy case 3:
The input `current_line` is a valid decorator with `depth = 0`. The `self.previous_line` is also a valid decorator and has the same depth, so the function should return `(1, 0)` based on the condition `if current_line.depth`. However, the actual output is not consistent. The `before` variable has a value of 0, which is expected.

### Buggy case 4:
The input `current_line` is not a decorator and has `depth = 0`. The `self.previous_line` is a decorator and not a yield at the same depth, so the function should return `(0, 0)` based on other specific conditions. The actual output is not consistent. The `before` variable has a value of 0, which is expected.

### Buggy case 5:
The input `current_line` is not a decorator and has `depth = 0`. The `self.previous_line` is not a decorator but a valid `self.previous_lin`. So, the function should return `(0, 0)` based on the conditions specified. The actual output is not consistent. The `before` variable has a value of 0, which is expected.

### Buggy case 6:
The input `current_line` is a valid decorator with `depth = 0`. The `self.previous_line` is also a valid decorator with the same depth, so the function should return `(1, 0)` as per a specific condition. The actual output is not consistent. The `before` variable has a value of 0, which is expected.

### Buggy case 7:
The input `current_line` is a valid `def` with `depth = 0`. The function should update `self.previous_defs` and return `(0, 0)` based on the conditions involving `is_def`. The actual output is consistent. The `before` variable has a value of 0, as expected, and `self.previous_defs` is updated as per the expectations.

### Buggy case 8:
The input `current_line` is a non-decorator with `depth = 1`. The function should check for specific conditions and return `(0, 0)` based on these conditions. The actual output is consistent with the expectation, as the `max_allowed` value is changed from 2 to 1, and the `before` value is 0 as expected.

In summary, based on the analysis of the buggy function code and the provided cases, there are inconsistencies in the outputs of the function with respect to the expected behavior. The function is not returning the expected tuples of integers based on the input conditions. To resolve this issue, closer inspection of the conditions and variable values at runtime is needed to pinpoint where the behavior is deviating from the expected logic.



## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

The function `_maybe_empty_lines` takes in a `current_line` parameter of type `Line` and returns a tuple of two integers. At the start of the function, a variable `max_allowed` is set to 1. The function then checks if `current_line.depth` is equal to 0 and changes the value of `max_allowed` to 2 if it is. It then proceeds to check for conditions where it resets the value of various variables based on a set of conditions. These variables include `before`, `depth`, and `is_decorator`.

The function returns different tuples based on various conditions. It checks for line type specifics (decorators, defs, classes, flow control, imports, and yields) and adjusts the tuple elements accordingly using the updated values of the mentioned variables. For example, before returning, the function checks for flow control, imports, or yield types of lines and returns a different tuple based on those criteria.

For example, when current_line is a decorator or a definition of a function or class, it returns a tuple with the number of newlines as 2 if the current line depth is non-zero. If the previous line is a decorator, it returns a tuple with 0 for both elements indicating that no empty lines should be inserted.

The function also updates the list `self.previous_defs` by adding `depth` when the `current_line` is a definition. 

Overall, the function determines the number of empty lines to be inserted before the `current_line` based on a variety of factors and returns the appropriate tuple of integers.
