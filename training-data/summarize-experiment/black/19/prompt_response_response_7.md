Following the analysis of the buggy function and the given test case, it appears that the issue lies in the logic for determining the number of empty lines to be inserted before the current line. The function `_maybe_empty_lines` has conditional statements that are not consistently producing the expected outputs for different input scenarios.

The inconsistency in the output of the function can be attributed to the conditions not being properly evaluated or the variables not being updated as expected. This could be due to incorrect logical conditions, incorrect variable assignments, or a combination of both.

To resolve this issue, the logical conditions within the function need to be carefully reviewed and adjusted to ensure that they accurately reflect the intended behavior. Additionally, the manipulation of variables such as `before`, `depth`, and `is_decorator` needs to be reviewed to ensure that they are being updated correctly and used consistently throughout the function.

The corrected code for the problematic function `_maybe_empty_lines` is provided below:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        else:
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

The corrected code addresses the issues related to the inconsistent behavior of the function by adjusting the logical conditions and variable updates. Now, the function should produce the expected output based on the input scenarios as outlined in the analysis.
