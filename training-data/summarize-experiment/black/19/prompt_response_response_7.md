Based on the test case and error message, it seems that the function `_maybe_empty_lines` is not correctly handling the generation of empty lines before and after the current line. The erroneous behavior likely leads to an incorrect output, causing the test to fail.

The potential error location within the function could be the logic for determining the number of empty lines to be added before and after the current line, especially in the if-else conditions related to the type of `current_line` and its relationship with the previous line.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug might be a misinterpretation of the conditions or incorrect handling of the relationships between different types of lines and their depths.

To fix the bug, the logic for determining the number of empty lines to be added before and after the current line needs to be carefully reviewed, refactored, and tested thoroughly to ensure it covers all possible scenarios.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass
from typing import List, Tuple

@dataclass
class Line:
    depth: int
    leaves: List[str]
    is_decorator: bool
    is_def: bool
    is_class: bool
    is_flow_control: bool
    is_import: bool
    is_yield: bool

class EmptyLineTracker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.previous_defs = []
        self.previous_line = None

    def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
        max_allowed = 1
        if current_line.depth == 0:
            max_allowed = 2

        before = 0
        if current_line.leaves:
            # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
            first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
            before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
            first_leaf.prefix = ""
        depth = current_line.depth

        while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
            self.previous_defs.pop()
            before = 1 if depth else 2
        
        if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
            if not current_line.is_decorator:
                self.previous_defs.append(depth)
            if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
                return 0, 0
            newlines = 2
            if current_line.depth:
                newlines -= 1
            return newlines, 0

        if current_line.is_flow_control:
            return before, 1

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_import
            and not current_line.is_import
            and depth == self.previous_line.depth
        ):
            return before or 1, 0

        if (
            self.previous_line
            and self.previous_line.is_yield
            and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
        ):
            return before or 1, 0

        return before, 0
```

This revised function includes handling of all the conditions based on the input parameters and the previous line's status. It uses the provided data types and logic to accurately determine the number of empty lines to be added before and after the current line.
