Based on the analysis of the provided function and the test case, the potential error location within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function seems to be related to the conditions and variable adjustments in the function. The inconsistencies in the output are likely stemming from the conditional logic and variable updates within the function.

The function is not consistently returning the expected tuples of integers based on the input conditions, which could be due to incorrect application of the conditions or improper handling of the variables within the function.

To address the bug, the following approaches can be considered:
1. Review and update the conditional logic within the function to ensure that the correct tuples of integers are returned based on the input conditions.
2. Verify the variable updates and assignments to ensure they are functioning as intended and are aligned with the expected behavior.
3. Check if the conditions related to line type specifics (decorators, defs, classes, flow control, imports, and yields) are accurately captured and handled.

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function that resolves the identified issue:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    if self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and
            not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and
            (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This revised version of the function addresses the identified issues and ensures that the expected tuples of integers are consistently returned based on the input conditions. The conditional logic and variable adjustments have been updated to align with the expected behavior, ensuring the correct computation of empty lines before and after the currently processed line.
