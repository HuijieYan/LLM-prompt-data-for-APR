Based on the given test cases and the error message, the bug seems to occur in the comparison of expected and actual outputs in the `test_comment_in_decorator` test case. It appears that the expected and actual outputs do not match as expected, leading to the assertion error.

Upon reviewing the provided function, it seems that the logic for handling the number of newlines before and after the current line might be incorrect.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to review the logic within the if-else conditions, especially the conditions related to decorators, defs, classes, flow control, imports, and yields. Additionally, it's important to ensure that the `self.previous_defs` list is being updated accurately.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `_maybe_empty_lines` function to ensure that it correctly calculates the number of newlines before and after the current line based on the given input and the state of the previous lines.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    
    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    is_def_or_class = current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class

    if is_def_or_class or current_line.is_decorator:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version, I've adjusted the conditions related to decorators, defs, classes, and other line types to ensure that the correct number of newlines is returned based on the given inputs and previous line state. This should address the bug and ensure that the `_maybe_empty_lines` function returns the expected output for the given test cases.
