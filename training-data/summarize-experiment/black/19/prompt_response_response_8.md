Based on the provided buggy function and the test case, it appears that the function `_maybe_empty_lines` is not consistently returning the expected tuples of integers based on the input conditions. The function checks for various line types and adjusts the tuple elements accordingly, but the output is not consistent with the expected logic.

The potential error location within the function could be the conditional statements that determine the values of `before` and the tuples to be returned. There may be inconsistencies in the conditional checks and assignments related to the variables `before`, `max_allowed`, and the conditional checks for different line types.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug could be incorrect assignments to the variables `before` and `max_allowed` within the conditional checks, leading to unexpected output. Additionally, the conditional checks for different line types may not accurately capture the conditions needed to return the correct tuple of integers.

To fix the bug, the conditional checks and assignments related to `before`, `max_allowed`, and the tuples to be returned based on different line types need to be reviewed and potentially revised to ensure they accurately capture the expected logic.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1

    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator

    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return before or 1, 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return before or 1, 0

    return before, 0
```

The revised function includes adjustments to the conditional checks and assignments to ensure the correct computation of `before` and the tuples to be returned based on different line types. This revision aims to address the inconsistent output observed in the original function.
