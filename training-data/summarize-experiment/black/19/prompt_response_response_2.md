Based on the provided error message and the buggy function, it seems that the issue is related to the handling of empty lines before and after specific types of lines (decorators, defs, imports, etc.) in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. The error message shows a comparison between the expected and actual output, indicating that the number of empty lines added before and after the current line is not as expected.

The most likely root cause of the bug is within the logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line based on its type and the relationship with the previous line. There may be incorrect conditions or calculations in the if-else blocks that evaluate the type of the current line and its relation to the previous line.

To fix the bug, the logic within the if-else conditions needs to be carefully reviewed and modified as necessary. It's important to ensure that the conditions accurately capture the intended scenarios for adding empty lines before and after the current line. Additionally, the handling of `self.previous_defs` and its relationship with the `depth` value should be thoroughly examined to ensure it aligns with the expected behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
        
    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()

        if depth:
            before = 1
        else:
            before = 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None or \
           (self.previous_line.is_decorator and current_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and \
       self.previous_line.is_import and \
       not current_line.is_import and \
       depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and \
       self.previous_line.is_yield and \
       (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected version:
- The logic for handling the number of empty lines before and after the current line based on its type and relationship with the previous line has been revised.
- The conditions for updating the `before` variable and the return values from the function have been adjusted to align with the expected behavior.
- The handling of `self.previous_defs` has been reviewed to ensure it is updated correctly based on the depth of the current line.

This corrected function should address the bug and produce the expected output for the test cases.
