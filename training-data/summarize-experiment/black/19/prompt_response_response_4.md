Based on the analysis of the test case and the provided buggy function, it appears that the issue lies within the logic for determining the number of empty lines to be inserted before the `current_line`. The function's return values are not consistent with the expected behavior based on the input conditions.

The potential error location within the function is the conditional logic that determines the return values based on the type of the `current_line` and the `previous_line`.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug could be:
1. Incorrect conditional checks leading to unexpected return values.
2. Improper handling of the `before` variable, resulting in inconsistency in its value.

To fix the bug, the conditional checks need to be carefully reviewed and adjusted to ensure that the function returns the expected tuple of integers based on the input conditions.

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected code, the conditional checks have been reviewed and adjusted to ensure that the function returns the expected tuple of integers based on the input conditions. The handling of the `before` variable has also been revised to maintain consistency in its value.

This corrected code should resolve the issue and provide the expected behavior for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.
