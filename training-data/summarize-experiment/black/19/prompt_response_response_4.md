Based on the provided information, it appears that the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is not behaving as expected, leading to failing test cases related to formatting issues. The test case `test_comment_in_decorator` is failing with an assertion error, indicating that the actual formatted output does not match the expected output.

Upon reviewing the function, it is clear that the logic for determining the number of empty lines before and after the current line is intricate. The function takes into account various conditions related to the type of `current_line` and its relationship with the previous line.

The potential error location within the function could be in the logic that determines the number of empty lines to be added before and after the current line based on its type and relationship with the previous line. It's possible that the conditional checks and value assignments within these sections are not accurately capturing all the intended scenarios, leading to incorrect formatting.

To address this issue and fix the bug, it's essential to carefully review and verify the logic within each conditional branch in the function. Specifically, ensure that each condition accurately reflects the intended scenario and that the corresponding number of empty lines is computed correctly.

Based on the observations, the following corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is provided:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if not self.previous_line:
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This revised version includes adjustments to the logic within conditional branches to ensure accurate computation of the number of empty lines before and after the current line based on its type and relationship with the previous line. This corrected version aims to address the formatting issues and align the function's behavior with the expected outcomes.
