Based on the provided information, it seems that the `assertFormatEqual` test case is failing with an assertion error. The error message indicates a mismatch between the expected and actual output of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.

Upon analyzing the function, it appears that the logic within the if-else conditions and value updates is not evaluating the intended scenarios as expected. This could be the root cause of the test failures.

The function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line based on various conditions. It seems that the logic for determining the number of empty lines is not functioning correctly, leading to the mismatch in the test results.

To address this issue, it's crucial to closely examine the logic within the if-else conditions, especially the conditions related to `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield`. Additionally, the management of `self.previous_defs` list needs to be validated to ensure it is being updated accurately.

Upon reviewing and adjusting the logic within these specific sections of the code and comparing them to the provided input values, the root cause of the test failures can be identified. It may also be necessary to conduct further testing and analysis to ensure the function behaves as intended in all possible scenarios.

Now, let's present the corrected code for the problematic `_maybe_empty_lines` function.

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()

    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

This corrected code addresses the potential issues within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function based on the analysis of the provided information and the identified buggy cases. This revised version of the function should serve as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
