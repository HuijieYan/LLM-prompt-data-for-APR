The `_maybe_empty_lines` function takes in a `current_line` object of type `Line` and returns a tuple of two integers representing the number of empty lines to be inserted before and after the current line.

1. It starts by setting `max_allowed` to 1, but if `current_line.depth` is equal to 0, then `max_allowed` is set to 2.
   
2. If `current_line.leaves` is not empty, it gets the number of newlines in the prefix of the first leaf, then sets `before` to the minimum between the number of newlines and `max_allowed` and finally sets the prefix to an empty string.

3. If `current_line.leaves` is empty, `before` is set to 0.

4. It establishes the value of `depth` as the value of `current_line.depth`.
   
5. It then iterates through `self.previous_defs` and pops values until a condition is not met. Respectively, `before` is set to 1 if `depth` is truthy, otherwise, it is set to 2.

6. Depending on the type of `current_line` (such as decorator, def, class, etc.) and the relationship with the previous line, it sets the appropriate number of newlines to be added before and after the current line.

7. The final return is `before` to indicate how many empty lines are to be added before the current line, and 0 to indicate that there should not be any empty lines added after the current line.
