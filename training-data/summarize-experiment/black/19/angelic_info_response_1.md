The function `_maybe_empty_lines` takes in a `current_line` parameter of type `Line` and returns a tuple of two integers. At the start of the function, a variable `max_allowed` is set to 1. The function then checks if `current_line.depth` is equal to 0 and changes the value of `max_allowed` to 2 if it is. It then proceeds to check for conditions where it resets the value of various variables based on a set of conditions. These variables include `before`, `depth`, and `is_decorator`.

The function returns different tuples based on various conditions. It checks for line type specifics (decorators, defs, classes, flow control, imports, and yields) and adjusts the tuple elements accordingly using the updated values of the mentioned variables. For example, before returning, the function checks for flow control, imports, or yield types of lines and returns a different tuple based on those criteria.

For example, when current_line is a decorator or a definition of a function or class, it returns a tuple with the number of newlines as 2 if the current line depth is non-zero. If the previous line is a decorator, it returns a tuple with 0 for both elements indicating that no empty lines should be inserted.

The function also updates the list `self.previous_defs` by adding `depth` when the `current_line` is a definition. 

Overall, the function determines the number of empty lines to be inserted before the `current_line` based on a variety of factors and returns the appropriate tuple of integers.
