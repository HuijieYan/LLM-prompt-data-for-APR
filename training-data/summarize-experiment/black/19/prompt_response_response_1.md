Upon analyzing the test case and its relationship with the error message, it seems that the `assertFormatEqual` method is failing because the expected and actual outputs differ in terms of the number of empty lines. This indicates that the `_maybe_empty_lines` function is not correctly determining the number of empty lines to be inserted before and after the current line.

The potential error location within the function seems to be the logic related to the determination of the number of empty lines before and after the current line. This includes the conditions for `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield`, as well as the management of the `self.previous_defs` list.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug could be related to incorrect logic within the if-else conditions, incorrect handling of previous line types, or improper updates to the `self.previous_defs` list.

To fix this bug, the following approaches could be considered:
1. Review and revise the if-else conditions within the function to ensure they accurately capture the intended scenarios for determining the number of empty lines.
2. Verify and adjust the handling of previous line types to ensure appropriate decisions are made about inserting empty lines.
3. Validate the management of the `self.previous_defs` list to ensure that it accurately represents the depth of previous lines.

Here is the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    
    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the newlines in the first leaf's prefix.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    
    if current_line.is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not current_line.is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0
        
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    
    return before, 0
```

In this corrected version of the function, the if-else conditions and variable assignments have been revised to accurately determine the number of empty lines to be inserted before and after the current line based on the given input parameters and variable values. This revised code should address the bug and produce the expected behavior in the test cases.
