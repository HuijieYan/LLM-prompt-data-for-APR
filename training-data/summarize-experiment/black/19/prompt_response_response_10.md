The provided function `_maybe_empty_lines` is responsible for determining the number of potential extra empty lines needed before and after the currently processed line. It is used within the `EmptyLineTracker` class to handle various line types and conditions.

Based on the analysis of the provided function and the related test case, it seems that the issue might be related to how the function is handling the calculation of extra empty lines before and after the current line. The discrepancies in the actual output compared to the expected output point to a potential logic error within the function.

Potential reasons for the occurrence of the bug:
1. Incorrect handling of line types and conditions within the function.
2. Variables not being updated or reset properly based on specific conditions.
3. Conditional checks not accurately capturing the intended logic for determining the number of empty lines.

To fix the bug, the function `_maybe_empty_lines` should be carefully reviewed to ensure that the conditions and variable updates are handled correctly to produce the expected output. This may involve adjusting conditional checks, updating variables based on specific conditions, and ensuring that the logic accurately captures the intended behavior for determining the number of extra empty lines.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function `_maybe_empty_lines`:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1 if current_line.depth != 0 else 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file or between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return (before or 1), 0

    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected code, changes have been made to the initialization of `max_allowed`, adjustment of the `before` variable based on specific conditions, and updates to the handling of different line types and conditions. The conditional checks and variable updates have been adjusted to ensure that the function produces the correct output based on the input line and previous line types.

This revised version of the function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version within the `EmptyLineTracker` class.
