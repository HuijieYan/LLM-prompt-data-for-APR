Based on the provided test case and error message, the bug seems to be related to the incorrect insertion of empty lines before and after the current line. The error message indicates a mismatch between the expected and actual output, specifically mentioning the presence of extra empty lines that were not expected.

Upon analyzing the buggy function and the provided test case, it appears that the logic for inserting empty lines based on certain conditions is not functioning as intended. This is likely causing the unexpected insertion of extra empty lines, leading to the test failure.

To address this bug, the following approaches can be considered:
1. Review the conditions and logic for inserting empty lines to ensure that they accurately reflect the intended behavior.
2. Verify that the relationships between the current line and the previous line are being properly evaluated to determine the correct number of empty lines to be inserted.
3. Check for any discrepancies in the handling of edge cases, such as decorators, classes, flow control statements, imports, and yields, to ensure that the correct number of empty lines is being considered.

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    before = 0
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    
    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return max(before, 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In this revised version of the function, I have adjusted the conditions for inserting empty lines based on the specified cases and relationships with the previous line. This revised code should address the bug and produce the expected output for the given test case.
