The provided error message indicates an assertion failure in the `assertFormatEqual` function within the test case `test_comment_in_decorator`. The expected and actual outputs are not matching, which suggests a potential bug in the `_maybe_empty_lines` function.

The potential error location within the `_maybe_empty_lines` function could be in the logic related to handling decorators, as the test case specifically mentions handling comments within decorators. 

The bug may have occurred due to incorrect handling of comments within decorators, leading to a discrepancy between the expected and actual outputs.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `_maybe_empty_lines` function handles comments within decorators correctly and returns the expected output based on the input `current_line`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    
    if current_line.is_decorator:
        if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0
        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0
    
    # other conditions for flow control, import, yield, etc. remain unchanged

    return before, 0
```

In this revised version, we have explicitly handled the case for decorators to ensure that empty lines are inserted or not as per the expected behavior. This should address the bug related to comments within decorators and align the function's behavior with the expected output.
