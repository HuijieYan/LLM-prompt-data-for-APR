Looking at the code, we see several if-else conditions and value updates inside the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. Let's analyze the buggy cases based on the given input parameters and variable values:

### Buggy Case 1:
The input parameter `current_line` has `depth=0`. Inside the function, `max_allowed` is updated to 2 based on this depth value. The `first_leaf` is `Leaf(AT, '@')`, and `before` is initially set to 0. Finally, `is_decorator` is set to True.

### Buggy Case 2:
The input parameter `current_line` has `depth=0`. The previous line is `Line(depth=0, leaves=[Leaf(AT, '@'), Leaf(NAME, 'property')])`. Inside the function, `max_allowed` is updated to 2 based on the depth value. The `first_leaf` is `Leaf(153, '# TODO: X')`, and `before` is initially set to 0.

### Buggy Case 3:
Similar to Case 1, the input parameter `current_line` has `depth=0`. It is a decorator, and the previous line is `Line(depth=0, leaves=[Leaf(153, '# TODO: X')])`. Inside the function, `max_allowed` is updated to 2 based on the depth value. The `first_leaf` is `Leaf(AT, '@')`, and `before` is initially set to 0.

### Buggy Case 4:
Again, the input parameter `current_line` has `depth=0`. The previous line is `Line(depth=0, leaves=[Leaf(AT, '@'), Leaf(NAME, 'property')])`. Inside the function, `max_allowed` is updated to 2 based on the depth value. The `first_leaf` is `Leaf(153, '# TODO: Y')`, and `before` is initially set to 0.

### Buggy Case 5:
The input parameter `current_line` has `depth=0`. The previous line is `Line(depth=0, leaves=[Leaf(153, '# TODO: Y')])`. Inside the function, `max_allowed` is updated to 2 based on the depth value. The `first_leaf` is `Leaf(153, '# TODO: Z')`, and `before` is initially set to 0.

### Buggy Case 6:
Similar to Case 3, the input parameter `current_line` has `depth=0`. It is a decorator, and the previous line is `Line(depth=0, leaves=[Leaf(153, '# TODO: Z')])`. Inside the function, `max_allowed` is updated to 2 based on the depth value. The `first_leaf` is `Leaf(AT, '@')`, and `before` is initially set to 0.

### Buggy Case 7:
The input parameter `current_line` has `depth=0` and `is_def=True`. The previous line is `Line(depth=0, leaves=[Leaf(AT, '@'), Leaf(NAME, 'property')])`. Inside the function, `max_allowed` is updated to 2 based on the depth value. The `first_leaf` is `Leaf(NAME, 'def')`, and `before` is initially set to 0. Additionally, `self.previous_defs` is updated to `[0]`.

### Buggy Case 8:
The input parameter `current_line` has `depth=1`. The previous line is `Line(depth=0, leaves=[Leaf(NAME, 'def'), Leaf(NAME, 'foo'), ...])` and since `depth=1`, `max_allowed` is set to 1. The `first_leaf` is `Leaf(NAME, 'pass')`, and `before` is initially set to 0.

Upon reviewing these cases, the function seems to work correctly based on the provided inputs and variable values. However, I noticed that the logic within the if-else conditions may not be evaluating the intended scenarios as expected.

To troubleshoot this issue, I would closely examine the logic behind the conditions of `is_decorator`, `is_def`, `is_class`, `is_flow_control`, `is_import`, and `is_yield`. It's also crucial to ensure that the `self.previous_defs` list is being updated accurately.

By closely reviewing these specific sections of the code and comparing them to the provided input values, it should be possible to identify the root cause of these test failures. Further testing and analysis may also be required to ensure the function behaves as intended in all possible scenarios.
