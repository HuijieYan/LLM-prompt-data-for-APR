Based on the provided test case and error message, it seems that the issue lies in the comparison of the expected and actual output of the function `_maybe_empty_lines`. The error message indicates a difference in the number of empty lines and comment positions, which suggests a discrepancy in the handling of comments and empty lines by the function.

The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the section where the processing of comments and empty lines is determined. Specifically, the conditions related to handling comments, decorators, defs, classes, flow controls, and imports might need to be reviewed for accuracy.

The discrepancy in the output may occur due to improper handling of comments and empty lines. If the logic for processing comments or empty lines is not implemented correctly, it can lead to the observed differences in the expected and actual outputs.

To fix the bug, it's important to thoroughly review the conditional checks for comments, decorators, defs, classes, flow controls, and imports. Ensure that the logic for handling empty lines and comments within these conditions is accurately captured. Additionally, the manipulation of the `before` and `max_allowed` variables should be revisited to ensure correct behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2
    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = min(first_leaf.prefix.count("\n"), max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0
    depth = current_line.depth
    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2
    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)
        if self.previous_line is None or (self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_decorator):
            return 0, 0
        newlines = 2 if current_line.depth else 1
        return newlines, 0
    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_import and not current_line.is_import and depth == self.previous_line.depth:
        return max(before, 1), 0
    if self.previous_line and self.previous_line.is_yield and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth):
        return max(before, 1), 0
    return before, 0
```

In the revised function, the handling of the `max_allowed` values, processing of comments, and adjustment of `before` values within different conditional blocks has been updated to ensure proper handling of empty lines and comments. This revised version should address the bug and accurately calculate the number of empty lines and comment positions.
