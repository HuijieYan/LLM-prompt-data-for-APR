Based on the analysis of the test case and the error message, it seems that the issue lies within the logic of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function. The function is not consistently returning the expected tuples of integers based on the input conditions.

The potential error location within the function could be the conditional statements and the logic for updating variables such as `before`, `depth`, and `is_decorator`.

One reason for the occurrence of the bug could be incorrect conditional logic and variable handling within the function. The inconsistent behavior in returning the expected tuple of integers suggests that the conditions and variable updates are not being handled properly.

To fix the bug, we should review and correct the conditional logic, variable updates, and the return statements based on the expected behavior outlined in the analysis.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _maybe_empty_lines(self, current_line: Line) -> Tuple[int, int]:
    max_allowed = 1
    if current_line.depth == 0:
        max_allowed = 2

    if current_line.leaves:
        # Consume the first leaf's extra newlines.
        first_leaf = current_line.leaves[0]
        before = first_leaf.prefix.count("\n")
        before = min(before, max_allowed)
        first_leaf.prefix = ""
    else:
        before = 0

    depth = current_line.depth

    while self.previous_defs and self.previous_defs[-1] >= depth:
        self.previous_defs.pop()
        before = 1 if depth else 2

    is_decorator = current_line.is_decorator
    if is_decorator or current_line.is_def or current_line.is_class:
        if not is_decorator:
            self.previous_defs.append(depth)

        if self.previous_line is None:
            # Don't insert empty lines before the first line in the file.
            return 0, 0

        if self.previous_line.is_decorator:
            # Don't insert empty lines between decorators.
            return 0, 0

        newlines = 2
        if current_line.depth:
            newlines -= 1
        return newlines, 0

    if current_line.is_flow_control:
        return before, 1

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_import
        and not current_line.is_import
        and depth == self.previous_line.depth
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    if (
        self.previous_line
        and self.previous_line.is_yield
        and (not current_line.is_yield or depth != self.previous_line.depth)
    ):
        return (before or 1), 0

    return before, 0
```

In the corrected code, the conditional logic and variable updates have been reviewed and adjusted based on the expected behavior outlined in the analysis. The return statements have been modified to ensure consistent and expected output based on the input conditions. This corrected version of the `_maybe_empty_lines` function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
