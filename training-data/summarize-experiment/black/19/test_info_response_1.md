The error message points to an assertion failure in the `assertFormatEqual` method of the test. The specific difference between the expected and actual output is highlighted in the error message. The `assertFormatEqual` method compares the expected formatting of the code with the actual formatting, and in this case, there is a difference between the two.

Looking at the test function `test_comment_in_decorator`, it appears that it is reading data from a file named "comments6", and then comparing the actual output of the `fs` function with the expected output. It is using the `assertFormatEqual` method to perform the comparison.

In the actual output, the presence of extra newlines is causing the assertion to fail. Specifically, the error message indicates that there are extra newlines in the actual output compared to the expected output.

Further analysis of the error message shows that the issue is related to the presence of extra newlines in the output, specifically within comments and decorators. It seems that the actual output is including extra newlines in certain places where they should not be, causing the assertion to fail.

This information points to a potential issue with the `fs` function, which is responsible for generating the actual output. It appears that the function is not handling newlines correctly in the context of comments and decorators, leading to the unexpected output and causing the test to fail.

To resolve this issue, the `fs` function should be reviewed and modified to ensure that it generates the correct output without the presence of extra newlines where they are not supposed to be, as indicated by the expected output.
