Based on the code provided and the variable runtime values and types observed during execution, it seems that the `_recache` function is intended to reset a set of internal variables to default values, and then call the `_marker_function` if it is not None. This function appears to be part of a larger class related to plotting in matplotlib.

Looking at the first buggy case, the input parameter `self` is an instance of the `MarkerStyle` class, and the variable `self._fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. It's important to note that the `_fillstyle` variable is not being reset or modified within the `_recache` function.

In the second buggy case, the input parameter and `_fillstyle` value are the same as in the first case. The variables `self._path`, `self._transform`, `self._snap_threshold`, `self._joinstyle`, `self._capstyle`, and `self._filled` are updated before the `_marker_function` is called.

Based on the code, it is clear that the `_recache` function is intended to reset the internal variables to default values. However, it seems that the function is not correctly updating the `self._filled` variable, as it should be set to `True`, but it is being set to `False`.

It's also important to note that the `_alt_path` and `_alt_transform` variables are set to `None` within the function, which matches the intended behavior.

Therefore, the issue with the function lies in the incorrect assignment of the `self._filled` variable. It's recommended to review the function to ensure that this variable is correctly reset to `True`. Additionally, the behavior of the `_fillstyle` variable should be investigated to confirm if it is intended to be reset or not within this function.
