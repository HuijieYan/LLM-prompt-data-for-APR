The potential error location within the problematic function is the incorrect assignment of the `self._filled` variable. It's being set to `False` instead of the expected value of `True`.

The bug occurred because the `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class is not correctly updating the `self._filled` variable to the expected value of `True`. This is leading to the incorrect behavior observed in the test case, where the markers are not appearing as hollow despite setting the `fillstyle` parameter to 'none'.

To fix the bug, the `_recache` function should be modified to ensure that the `self._filled` variable is correctly reset to `True`. Additionally, the behavior of the `_fillstyle` variable should be reviewed to confirm if it is intended to be reset or not within this function.

Here is the corrected code for the `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True  # Corrected assignment to reset _filled to True
        self._marker_function()
```

With this corrected implementation, the `_recache` function will properly reset the internal variables, including the `self._filled` variable, to their default values, addressing the bug and ensuring the expected behavior in the test case.
