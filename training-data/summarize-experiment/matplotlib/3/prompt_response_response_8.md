The error message "assert not True" in the test function `test_marker_fillstyle` indicates that the function `is_filled` is returning `True` when it should be returning `False` after setting `fillstyle='none'`.

The potential error in the buggy function could be related to the setting of the `_filled` attribute. When `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, the marker should be hollow, which means that `_filled` should be set to `False`. However, in the buggy function, the value of `_filled` is set to `True` unconditionally.

To fix this bug, we should update the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `fillstyle`. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, then `_filled` should be set to `False`. Otherwise, it should be set to `True`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the value of `fillstyle`, we ensure that the markers will be hollow when `fillstyle` is set to `'none'. This should address the bug and resolve the issue where markers are not hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `markers.MarkerStyle()`'s `fillstyle` to `'none'.
