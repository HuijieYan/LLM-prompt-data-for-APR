Summary:
The _recache function is designed to update several instance variables of the calling object. It first checks if the _marker_function attribute is not None, and exits if it is. If not, it proceeds to update the following instance variables:
- self._path is set to _empty_path
- self._transform is set to an IdentityTransform
- self._alt_path and self._alt_transform are set to None
- self._snap_threshold is set to None
- self._joinstyle is set to 'round'
- self._capstyle is set to 'butt'
- self._filled is set to True

Finally, it calls the _marker_function, re-caching the object's state.

This function assumes that the _marker_function modifies other variables not updated in this function, but necessary for the object's correct state.

The expected return value for the two test cases includes specific values for the updated variables, indicating what they should be after the function execution.
