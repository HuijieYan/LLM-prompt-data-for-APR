The bug in the function `_recache` is that when the `MarkerStyle` is instantiated with `fillstyle='none'`, the `_filled` attribute is not getting updated accordingly. This leads to the `is_filled()` method returning `True` when it should return `False` as indicated by the failed test case.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter provided during the instantiation of `MarkerStyle`.

Here's the corrected version of the function `_recache`:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update filled attribute based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this change, the `_filled` attribute will be updated based on the `fillstyle` parameter, ensuring that the `is_filled()` method returns the correct value.
