Based on the information provided, the issue with the `MarkerStyle` class and the `test_marker_fillstyle` function is likely due to the incorrect behavior of the `is_filled` method in the `MarkerStyle` class. This method should be updated to properly handle the fillstyle and return the expected value based on the fillstyle specified during the creation of the `MarkerStyle` object.

To address this issue, the `_recache` method in the `MarkerStyle` class should be reviewed and updated to ensure that the `is_filled` method returns the expected value based on the fillstyle specified during the creation of the `MarkerStyle` object.

The `_recache` function is designed to reset several internal variables to default values and then call the `_marker_function` if it is not None. It seems that the function is not correctly updating the `self._filled` variable, and the issue with the function lies in the incorrect assignment of the `self._filled` variable. It is recommended to review the function to ensure that this variable is correctly reset to `True`.

Based on these observations, here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = True
            self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version, the `_recache` function now properly resets the internal variables, including setting `self._filled` to `True` as intended. This should address the issue observed in the test function and ensure that the `MarkerStyle` object behaves as expected.
