You have been given the source code of a function that is currently failing its test cases. Accompanying this, you will find detailed information on the expected inputs and outputs for the function. This includes the value and type of each input parameter as well as the expected value and type of relevant variables when the function returns. Should an input parameter's value not be explicitly mentioned in the expected output, you can assume it has not changed. Your task is to create a summary that captures the core logic of the function. This involves examining how the input parameters relate to the return values, based on the function's source code.

Your mission involves a thorough analysis, where you'll need to correlate the specific variable values noted during the function's execution with the source code itself. By meticulously examining and referencing particular sections of the buggy code alongside the variable logs, you're to construct a coherent and detailed analysis.

We are seeking a comprehensive and insightful investigation. Your analysis should offer a deeper understanding of the function's behavior and logic.

The following is the buggy function code:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()

```

# Expected return value in tests
## Expected case 1
### Input parameter value and type
self, value: `<matplotlib.markers.MarkerStyle object at 0x10e6398e0>`, type: `MarkerStyle`

## Expected case 2
### Input parameter value and type
self, value: `<matplotlib.markers.MarkerStyle object at 0x10e6398e0>`, type: `MarkerStyle`

### Expected variable value and type before function return
self._path, expected value: `Path(array([[ 0.        , -1.  ...  4,  4,  4, 79], dtype=uint8))`, type: `Path`

self._transform, expected value: `<matplotlib.transforms.Affine2D object at 0x10e671f10>`, type: `Affine2D`

self._snap_threshold, expected value: `inf`, type: `float`

self._joinstyle, expected value: `'round'`, type: `str`

self._capstyle, expected value: `'butt'`, type: `str`

self._filled, expected value: `True`, type: `bool`
