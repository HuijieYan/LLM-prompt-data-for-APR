The bug in the `_recache` function arises from the incorrect setting of the `self._filled` attribute. The expected result is to set it to `True`, but in the buggy function, it is always set to `True` regardless of the initial value of `self._filled`.

To fix this issue, we need to update the assignment for `self._filled` based on the initial value of the `fillstyle` when creating the `MarkerStyle` object.

Here's the corrected implementation of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'
    self._marker_function()
```

This fix ensures that the `self._filled` attribute is set correctly based on the `fillstyle` specified when creating the `MarkerStyle` object, providing the expected behavior for the markers.
