The issue is likely occurring because the `MarkerStyle` class is not properly updating the `_filled` attribute when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'. This causes the `is_filled()` method to return `True` when it should return `False`, leading to the assertion error in the test case.

To fix the bug, the `_recache` function needs to be modified to properly update the `_filled` attribute in accordance with the `fillstyle` attribute of the `MarkerStyle` class.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

The modification involves updating the `_filled` attribute based on the value of the `_fillstyle` attribute of the `MarkerStyle` class. If the `_fillstyle` is 'none', then `_filled` is set to `False`, indicating that the marker should be hollow. Otherwise, `_filled` is set to `True`.

This fix will ensure that the `is_filled()` method of the `MarkerStyle` class returns the expected result in the test case, resolving the bug.
