Based on the code provided, it appears that the `_recache` function is intended to reset a set of internal variables to default values and then call the `_marker_function` if it is not None. It is assumed that this function is part of the `MarkerStyle` class in the matplotlib library, as indicated by the presence of the `_marker_function`.

The `_filled` variable is being set incorrectly within the `_recache` function, as it should be set to `True` but is being set to `False`. This incorrect assignment is likely the cause of the buggy behavior observed in the test case. Additionally, the `_fillstyle` variable should be reviewed to confirm if it is intended to be reset or not within this function.

To resolve the bug, the `_filled` variable should be set to `True` as intended, and the behavior of the `_fillstyle` variable should be reviewed to ensure it aligns with the expected behavior in the `MarkerStyle` class.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = True
        self._marker_function()
```
