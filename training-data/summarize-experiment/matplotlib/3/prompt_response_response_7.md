The error in the `test_marker_fillstyle` function arises from the fact that the marker is not being filled as expected when the `fillstyle` parameter is set to "none".

Upon analyzing the `MarkerStyle` class and the buggy function, it can be inferred that the issue lies in the `_recache` method of the `MarkerStyle` class. When the `fillstyle` attribute is set to 'none', the `_filled` attribute is expected to be set to `False` to render the marker as hollow. However, the `_filled` attribute is consistently set to `True` in the `_recache` method, which contradicts the expected behavior.

To fix this bug, the `_recache` method should be revised to appropriately set the `_filled` attribute based on the value of the `fillstyle` parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` method:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Adjust the filled attribute based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute in the `_recache` method to reflect the value of `self._fillstyle`, the `MarkerStyle` class will correctly render the marker as hollow when the `fillstyle` parameter is set to 'none'.

With this corrected code, the markers should now be displayed as hollow when utilizing `ax.scatter()` and setting `fillstyle` to 'none'. This addresses the reported bug and brings the behavior in line with the user's expectations.
