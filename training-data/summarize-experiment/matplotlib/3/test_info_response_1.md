The error message indicates that there is an assertion error in the `test_marker_fillstyle` function within the `test_marker.py` file. The specific line that caused the assertion error is `assert not marker_style.is_filled()`. The error message shows that the expression `assert not True` failed, and it provides additional context about the object and method that were called.

When we examine the test function, we can see that it creates a `MarkerStyle` object with the input marker and fillstyle values. It then checks the fillstyle of the marker style and verifies that it is set to 'none'. After that, it asserts that the marker style is not filled.

From the error message, it is apparent that the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` object is returning `True`, which leads to the assertion error in the test.

Upon further inspection of the `MarkerStyle` class within the matplotlib library, it's apparent that the `is_filled` method returns `True` by default, indicating that the marker is filled.

It can be inferred that the `MarkerStyle` created in the test does not adhere to the specified fillstyle, causing the assertion to fail.

To address this issue, the implementation of the `_recache` method in the `MarkerStyle` class could be reviewed. This method should properly handle the fillstyle and ensure that the `is_filled` method returns the expected value based on the fillstyle specified during the creation of the `MarkerStyle` object.

In summary, the error in the `test_marker_fillstyle` function is likely caused by the incorrect behavior of the `is_filled` method in the `MarkerStyle` class, which can be traced back to the functioning of the `_recache` method in the `MarkerStyle` class.
