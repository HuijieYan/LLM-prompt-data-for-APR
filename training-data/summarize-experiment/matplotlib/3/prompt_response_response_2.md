Given the information provided, it seems that the issue with the buggy function `_recache` lies in the incorrect assignment of the `self._filled` variable. This variable should be set to `True`, but it is being set to `False`.

To address this bug, the `_recache` function should correctly reset the internal variables, including the `self._filled` variable, to their default values. Additionally, the function should properly handle the `fillstyle` and ensure that the `is_filled` method returns the expected value based on the `fillstyle` specified during the creation of the `MarkerStyle` object.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is not None:
            self._path = _empty_path
            self._transform = IdentityTransform()
            self._alt_path = None
            self._alt_transform = None
            self._snap_threshold = None
            self._joinstyle = 'round'
            self._capstyle = 'butt'
            self._filled = (self._fillstyle != 'none')
            self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version, the `_recache` function now properly handles the `fillstyle` by setting the `self._filled` variable based on the `fillstyle` value. If the `fillstyle` is not 'none', `_filled` is set to `True`, indicating that the marker is filled. The `_marker_function` is then called to recalibrate the object's state.

This corrected version of the function addresses the bug by properly handling the `fillstyle` and setting the `self._filled` variable accordingly. It ensures that the `is_filled` method returns the expected value based on the `fillstyle` specified during the creation of the `MarkerStyle` object.
