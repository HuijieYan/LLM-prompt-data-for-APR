The error message indicates that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` when it should not be. This suggests that the `MarkerStyle` object is being incorrectly filled, which could be due to an issue in the `_recache` method.

Upon analyzing the buggy function and the runtime values, it appears that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `False` in the buggy function, whereas it should be set to `True`. This could be the reason for the incorrect behavior of the `is_filled` method.

To fix this bug, the `_recache` method should be updated to set the `_filled` attribute to `True` instead of `False`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` method:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True  # Corrected setting for the _filled attribute
    self._marker_function()
```

By making this change, the `MarkerStyle` objects should be rendered as hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `fillstyle` to 'none', as intended. This fix addresses the bug and aligns with the expected behavior described in the test case and issue description.
