The error message from the test function `test_marker_fillstyle()` indicates that the `is_filled()` method is returning `True` when it should be returning `False` after creating a `MarkerStyle` with the fillstyle set to 'none'.

Upon examining the `_recache` function, the issue is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally at the end of the function. This is incorrect because when the fillstyle is set to 'none', the marker should not be filled.

To fix this issue, we need to update the `_recache` function to take into account the fillstyle parameter and set the `_filled` attribute accordingly. If the fillstyle is 'none', then the marker should not be filled and `_filled` should be set to `False`.

Below is the corrected code for the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._fillstyle == 'none':
        self._filled = False
    else:
        self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()
```

By adding a conditional check for the fillstyle and setting `_filled` accordingly, we ensure that the marker is not filled when the fillstyle is set to 'none'.

This updated code should resolve the issue with markers not being hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting the `MarkerStyle`'s fillstyle to 'none'. This will also address the error in the `test_marker_fillstyle()` test function.
