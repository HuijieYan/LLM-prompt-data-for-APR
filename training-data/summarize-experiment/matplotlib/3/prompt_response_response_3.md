The `test_marker_fillstyle` function fails with the AssertionError `assert not marker_style.is_filled()`. This implies that the `is_filled` method is returning `True` instead of the expected `False`, indicating that the marker is not being displayed as hollow as intended.

Looking at the function `_recache` and the attributes before return, we see that `_filled` is set to `False` instead of `True`. This might be causing the `is_filled` method to return the incorrect value.

To fix this bug, we should ensure that the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` when the `fillstyle` of the `MarkerStyle` is not 'none'.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Set _filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

By setting `_filled` based on the `fillstyle`, the issue causing the markers to be filled instead of hollow should be resolved.
