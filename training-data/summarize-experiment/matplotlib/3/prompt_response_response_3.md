Based on the provided information and analysis, the issue with the buggy function `_recache` in the `MarkerStyle` class lies in the incorrect assignment of the `self._filled` variable. It should be set to `True`, but it is being set to `False`.

To address this issue and ensure that the `MarkerStyle` object reflects the specified fillstyle, the `_recache` method should be updated to handle the fillstyle properly and adjust the `self._filled` variable accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    # ... other class methods ...

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = (self.get_fillstyle() != 'none')  # Adjust the filled status based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `_filled` variable is updated based on the fillstyle specified for the `MarkerStyle` object. If the fillstyle is 'none', the `_filled` status is set to `False`; otherwise, it is set to `True` to reflect the filled status accordingly.

This updated implementation should ensure that the `MarkerStyle` object behaves as expected with the specified fillstyle, and it should address the issue encountered in the test case and the GitHub issue related to markers not appearing as hollow.
