The bug in the provided function is that the `_filled` attribute is being set to `True` unconditionally at the end of the function, which contradicts the expectations of the `MarkerStyle` class.

Based on the provided test case and error message, it seems that the `MarkerStyle` class has a method `is_filled()` that is being used to check whether the marker is filled or not. This method should return `False` when `fillstyle='none'` is used, indicating that the marker should not be filled. However, the buggy function unconditionally sets `_filled` to `True` at the end, causing the discrepancy.

To fix this bug, the `_filled` attribute should be set based on the value of `fillstyle`. If `fillstyle` is set to `'none'`, `_filled` should be set to `False`, indicating that the marker should not be filled.

Here's the corrected function:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Set _filled based on the fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```
With this correction, the `_filled` attribute will now be set based on the value of `fillstyle`, ensuring that it aligns with the expectations of the `MarkerStyle` class. This fix should resolve the issue where markers are not being rendered as hollow when `fillstyle='none'` is used.
