Based on the provided information and the analysis of the bug and the related test case, it appears that the issue lies in the incorrect behavior of the `is_filled` method in the `MarkerStyle` class. This behavior can be traced back to the functioning of the `_recache` method in the `MarkerStyle` class.

The `_recache` method should properly handle the fillstyle and ensure that the `is_filled` method returns the expected value based on the fillstyle specified during the creation of the `MarkerStyle` object. To fix this issue, the `_recache` method should be updated to handle the `fillstyle` and accordingly set the `self._filled` variable based on the fillstyle.

Below is the corrected version of the `_recache` function for the `MarkerStyle` class:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    # other class methods and attributes

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = Affine2D()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        if self._fillstyle in ['full', 'left', 'right']:
            self._filled = True
        else:
            self._filled = False
        self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version, the `_recache` function has been updated to handle the `fillstyle` attribute. If the `fillstyle` is 'full', 'left', or 'right', the marker is considered filled and `self._filled` is set to True. If the `fillstyle` is 'none' or any other value, the marker is considered not filled and `self._filled` is set to False.

This fix ensures that the `_recache` function properly sets the `self._filled` variable based on the `fillstyle` specified, allowing the `is_filled` method to return the expected value and resolving the bug.

Please replace the existing `_recache` function in the `MarkerStyle` class with this corrected version to fix the bug related to the `fillstyle` parameter and the behavior of the `is_filled` method.
