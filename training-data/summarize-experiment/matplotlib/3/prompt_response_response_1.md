Based on the provided information, the issue lies in the `_recache` method of the `MarkerStyle` class. The `is_filled` method returns `True` by default, indicating that the marker is filled, which contradicts the expected behavior specified in the test function.

To address this issue, the `_recache` method should properly handle the fillstyle and ensure that the `is_filled` method returns the expected value based on the fillstyle specified during the creation of the `MarkerStyle` object.

Here's the corrected version of the `_recache` method in the `MarkerStyle` class:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    # ... omitted code ...

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'
        self._marker_function()
```

In the corrected version, the `_filled` variable is updated based on the `_fillstyle` attribute. If `_fillstyle` is set to 'none', `_filled` is set to `False`; otherwise, it is set to `True` to reflect the intended behavior specified in the test case.

With this corrected implementation, the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` class should now return the expected value based on the fillstyle specified during the creation of the `MarkerStyle` object.
