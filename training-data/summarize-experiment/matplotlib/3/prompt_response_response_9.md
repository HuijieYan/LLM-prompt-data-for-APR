The buggy function is not utilizing the `_filled` attribute to determine whether or not to call the `_marker_function`. This attribute is only set to `False` and not manipulated based on inputs or conditions, leading to the function always being called. This results in the markers not being hollow as expected.

To address this issue, the `_filled` attribute should be used as a condition to determine whether the `_marker_function` should be called. If `_filled` is `True`, then the function will be called. If it is `False`, the function should not be called.

Here's the corrected version of the function that resolves the issue:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    if self._filled:
        self._marker_function()
```

By using the `_filled` attribute as a condition for calling the `_marker_function`, the function can properly handle the scenario where the markers need to be hollow. This will resolve the issue and allow the markers to be displayed as expected.
