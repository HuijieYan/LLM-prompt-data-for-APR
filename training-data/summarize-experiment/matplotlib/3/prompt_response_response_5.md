The test case `test_marker_fillstyle` aims to ensure that the `MarkerStyle` can be created with a specific `fillstyle` and that the `is_filled` method correctly returns whether the marker is filled. The error occurs when the `is_filled` method returns the opposite of the expected value, indicating that the `MarkerStyle` is incorrectly set as filled when the `fillstyle` is 'none'.

The bug is likely located in the `_recache` method of the `MarkerStyle` class, where the `fillstyle` is not properly handled. It seems that the `_filled` attribute is not being set correctly based on the `fillstyle`.

To fix this bug, first, we need to update the `_recache` method to properly handle the `fillstyle` attribute. The `fillstyle` parameter should be used to determine whether the marker is filled or not. If the `fillstyle` is 'none', the marker should not be filled, so the `_filled` attribute should be set to `False`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_recache` method:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = self._fillstyle.lower() != 'none'  # Update filled based on fillstyle
    self._marker_function()
```

With this correction, the `_recache` method now properly updates the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` parameter.

Once the above fix is applied, the error observed in the `test_marker_fillstyle` should be resolved and the markers should render as hollow when setting the `fillstyle` to 'none'.
