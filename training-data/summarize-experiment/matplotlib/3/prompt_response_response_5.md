The buggy function `_recache` is causing an issue where the markers are not hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and setting `markers.MarkerStyle()`'s fillstyle to 'none'. The issue seems to arise from the fact that the `_filled` attribute is set to `True` by default in the `_recache` function, which conflicts with the intention of setting the fill style to 'none'.

To fix this issue, the `_recache` function needs to correctly handle the `fillstyle` attribute of `MarkerStyle` and update the `_filled` attribute accordingly. The revised code for the function is as follows:

```python
class MarkerStyle():
    # ... (omitted code) ...

    def _recache(self):
        if self._marker_function is None:
            return
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'  # Update _filled based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

By updating the `_filled` attribute based on the `fillstyle` using `self.get_fillstyle() != 'none'`, the function will correctly handle the fill style and the markers will behave as expected, allowing them to be hollow when the `fillstyle` is set to 'none'.

This change ensures that the fillstyle setting for MarkerStyle is properly reflected in the `_filled` attribute, allowing the markers to display as hollow when 'none' is specified as the fillstyle.

Additionally, this corrected code can be used as a drop-in replacement for the original buggy function.
