The issue with the provided buggy function `_recache` is related to its failure to properly reset the `_filled` attribute to `True`, which results in unexpected behavior in the context of the `MarkerStyle` class.

Upon analyzing the test case `test_marker_fillstyle`, it is evident that the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` object is returning `True`, which contradicts the expected behavior based on the specified `fillstyle='none'`. This discrepancy indicates that the `_recache` function is not correctly handling the reset of the `_filled` attribute.

To fix this bug, the `_recache` function should be modified to properly handle the reset of the relevant instance variables, including `_filled`, based on the provided fillstyle.

Here is the corrected version of the `_recache` function:

```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is not None:
        self._path = _empty_path
        self._transform = IdentityTransform()
        self._alt_path = None
        self._alt_transform = None
        self._snap_threshold = None
        self._joinstyle = 'round'
        self._capstyle = 'butt'
        self._filled = self._fillstyle != 'none'  # Correctly updating the _filled attribute based on fillstyle
        self._marker_function()
```

In this corrected version, the `_filled` attribute is updated based on the value of `_fillstyle` to ensure that it reflects the desired behavior specified in the test case.

This revised function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version to address the issues related to the incorrect handling of the `fillstyle` and `_filled` attribute.
