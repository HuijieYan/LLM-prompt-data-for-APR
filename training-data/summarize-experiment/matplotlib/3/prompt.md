Please correct the malfunctioning function provided below by using the relevant information listed to address this bug. Then, produce a revised version of the function that resolves the issue. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
from .transforms import IdentityTransform, Affine2D
```

The following is the buggy function that you need to fix:
```python
def _recache(self):
    if self._marker_function is None:
        return
    self._path = _empty_path
    self._transform = IdentityTransform()
    self._alt_path = None
    self._alt_transform = None
    self._snap_threshold = None
    self._joinstyle = 'round'
    self._capstyle = 'butt'
    self._filled = True
    self._marker_function()

```



## Functions Used in the Buggy Function
```python# class declaration containing the buggy function
class MarkerStyle():
    # ... omitted code ...


```



## Test Functions and Error Messages Summary
The followings are test functions under directory `lib/matplotlib/tests/test_marker.py` in the project.
```python
def test_marker_fillstyle():
    marker_style = markers.MarkerStyle(marker='o', fillstyle='none')
    assert marker_style.get_fillstyle() == 'none'
    assert not marker_style.is_filled()
```

Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:
The error message indicates that there is an assertion error in the `test_marker_fillstyle` function within the `test_marker.py` file. The specific line that caused the assertion error is `assert not marker_style.is_filled()`. The error message shows that the expression `assert not True` failed, and it provides additional context about the object and method that were called.

When we examine the test function, we can see that it creates a `MarkerStyle` object with the input marker and fillstyle values. It then checks the fillstyle of the marker style and verifies that it is set to 'none'. After that, it asserts that the marker style is not filled.

From the error message, it is apparent that the `is_filled` method of the `MarkerStyle` object is returning `True`, which leads to the assertion error in the test.

Upon further inspection of the `MarkerStyle` class within the matplotlib library, it's apparent that the `is_filled` method returns `True` by default, indicating that the marker is filled.

It can be inferred that the `MarkerStyle` created in the test does not adhere to the specified fillstyle, causing the assertion to fail.

To address this issue, the implementation of the `_recache` method in the `MarkerStyle` class could be reviewed. This method should properly handle the fillstyle and ensure that the `is_filled` method returns the expected value based on the fillstyle specified during the creation of the `MarkerStyle` object.

In summary, the error in the `test_marker_fillstyle` function is likely caused by the incorrect behavior of the `is_filled` method in the `MarkerStyle` class, which can be traced back to the functioning of the `_recache` method in the `MarkerStyle` class.



## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

Based on the code provided and the variable runtime values and types observed during execution, it seems that the `_recache` function is intended to reset a set of internal variables to default values, and then call the `_marker_function` if it is not None. This function appears to be part of a larger class related to plotting in matplotlib.

Looking at the first buggy case, the input parameter `self` is an instance of the `MarkerStyle` class, and the variable `self._fillstyle` is set to `'none'`. It's important to note that the `_fillstyle` variable is not being reset or modified within the `_recache` function.

In the second buggy case, the input parameter and `_fillstyle` value are the same as in the first case. The variables `self._path`, `self._transform`, `self._snap_threshold`, `self._joinstyle`, `self._capstyle`, and `self._filled` are updated before the `_marker_function` is called.

Based on the code, it is clear that the `_recache` function is intended to reset the internal variables to default values. However, it seems that the function is not correctly updating the `self._filled` variable, as it should be set to `True`, but it is being set to `False`.

It's also important to note that the `_alt_path` and `_alt_transform` variables are set to `None` within the function, which matches the intended behavior.

Therefore, the issue with the function lies in the incorrect assignment of the `self._filled` variable. It's recommended to review the function to ensure that this variable is correctly reset to `True`. Additionally, the behavior of the `_fillstyle` variable should be investigated to confirm if it is intended to be reset or not within this function.



## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

Summary:
The _recache function is designed to update several instance variables of the calling object. It first checks if the _marker_function attribute is not None, and exits if it is. If not, it proceeds to update the following instance variables:
- self._path is set to _empty_path
- self._transform is set to an IdentityTransform
- self._alt_path and self._alt_transform are set to None
- self._snap_threshold is set to None
- self._joinstyle is set to 'round'
- self._capstyle is set to 'butt'
- self._filled is set to True

Finally, it calls the _marker_function, re-caching the object's state.

This function assumes that the _marker_function modifies other variables not updated in this function, but necessary for the object's correct state.

The expected return value for the two test cases includes specific values for the updated variables, indicating what they should be after the function execution.



## Summary of the GitHub Issue Related to the Bug

## Summary
The GitHub issue details a bug where markers are not appearing as hollow when using `ax.scatter()` and customizing the MarkerStyle by setting `fillstyle` parameter to 'none'. The user's expectation is to have hollow markers, but the current implementation does not reflect that.

## Reproduction Steps
1. Import necessary libraries: 
   ```python
   from matplotlib import pyplot as plt
   from matplotlib import markers
   import numpy as np
   ```
2. Generate random data for scatter plot: 
   ```python
   xy = np.random.rand(10, 2)
   ```
3. Create a new figure and axis:
   ```python
   fig, ax = plt.subplots()
   ```
4. Customize MarkerStyle to set markers as hollow:
   ```python
   style = markers.MarkerStyle(marker='o', fillstyle='none')
   ```
5. Use `ax.scatter()` to plot the scatter plot with custom MarkerStyle:
   ```python
   ax.scatter(xy[:, 0], xy[:, 1], marker=style)
   ```
6. Display the plot:
   ```python
   plt.show()
   ```

## Expected Outcome
The expected outcome is to have a scatter plot with hollow markers based on the customized MarkerStyle with `fillstyle='none'`.

## Current Outcome
The current outcome does not match the expectation, as the markers are not appearing as hollow despite setting the `fillstyle` parameter to 'none'. This leads to the bug in the visualization.

## Additional Notes
The issue suggests a potential discrepancy between the intended usage of custom MarkerStyle with `fillstyle='none'` and the actual behavior observed in the scatter plot. Further investigation is required to identify the root cause and devise an appropriate solution for this bug.
