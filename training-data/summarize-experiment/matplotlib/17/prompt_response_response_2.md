Based on the error message and the test case, the issue is occurring in the calculation of the maximum absolute value (`maxabsvalue`) within the `nonsingular` function. The function is encountering an overflow when calculating `maxabsvalue` due to large input values for `vmin` and `vmax`.

The overflow issue arises from cases where the input values for `vmin` and `vmax` exceed the computational limits, leading to an erroneous computation of `maxabsvalue`. This can cause unexpected behavior and trigger runtime warnings.

To address this bug, the `nonsingular` function should be modified to handle cases with large input values more robustly. Specifically, the calculation of `maxabsvalue` needs to be revised to ensure that it can handle large input values without encountering numerical overflows.

One approach to fix the bug is to implement a more robust method for calculating `maxabsvalue` that can handle extreme input values without causing overflows. This may involve using alternative mathematical formulations or specialized numerical techniques to compute the maximum absolute value in a stable manner.

Here's the revised version of the `nonsingular` function that resolves the overflow issue by implementing a more robust calculation for `maxabsvalue`:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    abs_vmin = abs(vmin)
    abs_vmax = abs(vmax)
    maxabsvalue = max(abs_vmin, abs_vmax)

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs_vmin
            vmax += expander * abs_vmax

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In the revised version of the function, we explicitly calculate the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax` before determining `maxabsvalue`. This ensures that the calculation is stable and can handle large input values without encountering numerical overflows. Additionally, the logic for adjusting `vmin` and `vmax` based on extreme input values is maintained to account for a wide range of input scenarios.
