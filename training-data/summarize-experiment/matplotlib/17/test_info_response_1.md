The given source code of the function `nonsingular` along with the error messages indicates a bug related to a `RuntimeWarning` of overflow encountered in scalar absolute.

The test function `test_colorbar_int` in the `test_colorbar.py` file seems to be indirectly invoking the `nonsingular` function. The function performs modifications of the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. The error message highlights overflow warning and inconsistent behavior in the `nonsingular` function as well as when calling it in the test functions. The issue specifically occurs in the computation of the `maxabsvalue` variable.

To fix the problem, focus on examining the computation of `maxabsvalue` and the underlying fundamental mechanism of the `nonsingular` function.

Reference the code in the `nonsingular`:

```python
maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
```

This line is the cause of the issue, as it is attempting to find the maximum absolute value between `vmin` and `vmax` using the `max` and `abs` functions. The error stems from overflow when computing the absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax`.

To address this problem and prevent overflow, consider modifying the computation of `maxabsvalue`.

```python
maxabsvalue = abs(max(vmin, vmax))
```

By swapping the positions of `max` and `abs` in the above line, the function will now find the maximum of `vmin` and `vmax` first and then apply the absolute function.

After making this modification, run the test functions again, specifically `test_colorbar_int`, to ensure that the `nonsingular` function is working as expected without any overflow warnings.
