Based on the test function and the error message, it's clear that the `nonsingular` function is throwing an overflow error. This is happening when calculating the `maxabsvalue` variable, specifically when taking the absolute value of either `vmin` or `vmax`. The error message contains the following relevant information:
- "vmin = -32768, vmax = 0, expander = 0.1, tiny = 1e-15, increasing = True"
- The code snippet that contains the error is: `maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))`
- The error message says: `RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar absolute`
  
The test function itself doesn't seem to directly cause the issue with the `nonsingular` function. However, the parameters provided in the test case are exactly the same as those in the error message.

Therefore, the critical information from both the test function and the error message is:
- The input parameters of `vmin` and `vmax` are -32768 and 0, respectively.
- The error occurs when calculating `maxabsvalue` using `abs(vmin)` and `abs(vmax)`.
- The error message indicates that an overflow was encountered when taking the scalar absolute of one of these values.

Based on this information, it's evident that the issue is caused by the calculation of maxabsvalue in the `nonsingular` function when dealing with large integer values. This causes an overflow while taking the absolute value of these large integers.

To resolve this issue, the `nonsingular` function's calculations should be modified to handle large integer values appropriately, perhaps by ensuring that the operands are properly cast to float before performing mathematical operations that involve large integer values.
