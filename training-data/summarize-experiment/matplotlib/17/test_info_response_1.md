The error message indicates a `RuntimeWarning` that an overflow was encountered in scalar absolute when calculating the maximum absolute value in the `nonsingular` function. This warning originates from the `maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))` line in the `nonsingular` function of the buggy code where the calculation is causing an overflow.

This overflow issue is surfacing due to the large values of `vmin` and `vmax` being passed into the `nonsingular` function. In this specific instance, `vmin = -32768` and `vmax = 0`, which triggers the aforementioned overflow warning. Consequently, the code execution fails to process `maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))` due to the excessively large value of `vmin`.

It is evident that the `nonsingular` function is not accounting for cases where the magnitude of the inputs exceeds the computational limits. This demonstrates that the implementation of the function requires explicit handling for extreme input values.

In the test code, the `test_colorbar_int` test function is being used to validate the functionality of a color bar, and it expects that the `vmin` and `vmax` values of the color map are consistent with the predefined `clim` values. This ensures that the generation of the color map and the associated color bar reflect the specified range of data. However, during the execution of `fig.colorbar(im)` in the `test_colorbar_int` function, the overflow warning is triggered due to the underlying call to the `nonsingular` function as described earlier.

To address this issue, the `nonsingular` function should be adapted to handle cases where the input values cause overflows or other computational issues. Additionally, the test cases should be extended to explicitly cover scenarios with large input values that could potentially lead to overflow warnings. This will help to ascertain the robustness and reliability of the color bar generation process under various input conditions.
