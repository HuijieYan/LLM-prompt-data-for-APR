Based on the analysis of the provided test case and error message, it appears that the issue with the `nonsingular` function is related to handling large integer values, which leads to an overflow error when taking the absolute value of these values. The code is not handling integer values appropriately, as the function expects float values. Additionally, the function is missing the necessary import statement for the numpy module, which may cause inconsistencies in its behavior.

To fix the bug, the following steps should be taken:
1. Add the necessary import statement for the numpy module at the beginning of the `nonsingular` function to ensure that the function can properly utilize numpy's features.
2. Modify the function to handle integer values appropriately by explicitly casting the input parameters to float before performing mathematical operations or taking absolute values.

Here is the revised `nonsingular` function that addresses the identified issues:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    vmin = float(vmin)  # Explicitly cast to float
    vmax = float(vmax)  # Explicitly cast to float

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

The revised function explicitly casts the input parameters `vmin` and `vmax` to float to handle integer values appropriately. It also includes the necessary import statement for the numpy module at the beginning of the function. These changes address the identified issues and should resolve the bug.
