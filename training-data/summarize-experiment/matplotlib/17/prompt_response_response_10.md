Based on the provided information, the potential error location within the `nonsingular` function is related to the calculation of the maximum absolute value (`maxabsvalue`). The function is currently triggering a `RuntimeWarning` due to an overflow encountered in scalar absolute, likely caused by excessively large input values leading to computational issues.

The bug occurs because the function does not explicitly handle cases where the magnitude of the input values exceeds the computational limits, resulting in overflow warnings and potential inaccuracies in the calculated `maxabsvalue`.

To fix this bug, the `nonsingular` function should be modified to explicitly handle cases with large input values in a manner that prevents computational issues and overflow warnings. This can be achieved by incorporating checks for extreme input values and implementing appropriate handling to ensure the accurate calculation of `maxabsvalue`.

Here is the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function that resolves the identified issue:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """
    
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    
    # Additional handling for extreme input values
    if maxabsvalue > 1e6:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version of the `nonsingular` function includes additional handling for extreme input values to prevent overflow issues and accurately calculate `maxabsvalue`. The modified code ensures that the function operates correctly with large input values and maintains the integrity of the endpoint modification process, addressing the identified bug.
