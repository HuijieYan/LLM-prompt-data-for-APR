The buggy function `nonsingular` is designed to modify the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. However, there is a potential bug in the computation of `maxabsvalue` which may cause overflow warnings and inconsistent behavior. The bug is likely occurring due to the combination of `max` and `abs` functions in the following line:

```python
maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
```

The bug may occur because the `max` function may cause overflow while calculating the maximum value among the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax`.

To address this issue, the computation of `maxabsvalue` needs to be modified to prevent potential overflow. One possible approach is to swap the positions of `max` and `abs` to first find the maximum of `vmin` and `vmax` and then apply the absolute function. This can be achieved by changing the line to:

```python
maxabsvalue = abs(max(vmin, vmax))
```

By making this modification, the potential overflow issue in the computation of `maxabsvalue` can be resolved.

Here is the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function incorporating the fix:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = abs(max(vmin, vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander
    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

This corrected version of the `nonsingular` function addresses the potential overflow bug in the computation of `maxabsvalue` by modifying the order of operations for finding the maximum absolute value, thereby preventing potential overflow warnings and ensuring consistent behavior of the function.
