The potential error in the `nonsingular` function is likely in the calculation of `maxabsvalue` when dealing with large integer values, which can lead to an overflow error.

The function also has calls to numpy functions like `np.isfinite` and `np.finfo`, but the `import numpy as np` statement is missing, which could result in inconsistencies in the function's behavior.

To fix the bug, the following steps should be taken:
- Add the `import numpy as np` statement at the beginning of the function to ensure proper access to numpy functions.
- Ensure that the input parameters `vmin` and `vmax` are of float type to avoid potential issues with large integer values.
- Review the logic for calculating `maxabsvalue` and ensure that it can handle a wide range of input values without encountering an overflow error.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(float(vmin)), abs(float(vmax)))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

The revised function includes the `import numpy as np` statement at the beginning, and it ensures that the input parameters and intermediate calculations are appropriately handled as floats to avoid potential overflow issues.
