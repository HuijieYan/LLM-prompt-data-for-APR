Looking at the function code and the variable logs, we can see several issues that might be the cause of the buggy behavior.

In the first case, the input parameters are integers, but the function expects floats. The function's initial check for finite values will fail, as it explicitly checks for `np.isfinite` (numpy's finite value test). This would lead to the return of `-expander`, `expander`, which is inconsistent with the observed output values in the log.

Additionally, the condition `maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` is false for maxabsvalue = 1.0, which means the subsequent condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` should be evaluated. This condition evaluates to true, but the execution doesn't follow the expected behavior, which indicates a potential problem with this part of the code.

In the second case, the input and output values are consistent, so let's not focus on this case.

In the third case, the fact that `maxabsvalue` is 0.5, and `vmin` and `vmax` are correctly switched and updated based on the conditions, but still an inconsistency is observed after swapping, indicates that the problem might be related to the swapping condition.

In the fourth case, the behavior indicates that the initial condition for checking finite values is not being executed correctly since the return should be `-expander`, `expander`, but the observed output values are different.

In the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth cases, the code returns the expected output for all the inputs given. This indicates that the function is correct in these cases.

The most probable cause of the bug is that the function is dependent on numpy (`np` was seen in the code) but the module is not imported in the function, leading to inconsistencies between the expected and actual performance of the function.

To debug the issues, the `import numpy as np` statement should be added at the beginning of the function. The function's handling of input types should also be reviewed to ensure consistency and accuracy.

After addressing these issues, the function should be retested with the problematic cases to verify that the bug has been fixed.
