The bug in the `nonsingular` function is likely occurring due to an overflow warning encountered in the computation of the variable `maxabsvalue`. 

The current line that calculates `maxabsvalue` is:

```python
maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
```

The issue stems from the application of `abs` to potentially large floating-point numbers, leading to overflow warnings in certain cases. To address this, we can modify the computation of `maxabsvalue` to prevent overflow by swapping the positions of `max` and `abs` in the above line:

```python
maxabsvalue = abs(max(vmin, vmax))
```

With this change, the function will first find the maximum of `vmin` and `vmax` and then apply the absolute function. This modification should prevent the overflow warnings encountered in the original code.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function with the fix applied:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = abs(max(vmin, vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

With this correction, the function should now behave as expected without encountering overflow warnings. This revised version of the `nonsingular` function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
