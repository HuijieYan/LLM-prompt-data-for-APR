The issue with the `nonsingular` function seems to be related to the handling of input parameter types and the use of numpy without importing it within the function. The error message about an overflow encountered in scalar absolute suggests that the function is not handling large integer values appropriately. Additionally, the initial check for finite values in the function is not being executed correctly.

To fix the bug, the `import numpy as np` statement should be added at the beginning of the function to ensure that numpy is available for use. Additionally, the function's handling of input types should be reviewed to ensure consistency and accuracy.

Here is the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(float(vmin)), abs(float(vmax)))  # Ensure that the values are cast to float
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(float(vmin))  # Ensure that the values are cast to float
            vmax += expander*abs(float(vmax))  # Ensure that the values are cast to float

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

By including the `import numpy as np` statement and ensuring that the input values are cast to float where necessary, the issues related to type consistency and handling of large integer values should be resolved. The corrected function should now handle the problematic cases appropriately and return the expected outputs.
