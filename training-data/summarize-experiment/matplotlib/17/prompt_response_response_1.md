Based on the test function and the error message, it's clear that the `nonsingular` function is throwing an overflow error. This is happening when calculating the `maxabsvalue` variable, specifically when taking the absolute value of either `vmin` or `vmax`. The error message contains the following relevant information:
- "vmin = -32768, vmax = 0, expander = 0.1, tiny = 1e-15, increasing = True"
- The code snippet that contains the error is: `maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax)`
- The error message says: `RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar absolute`
  
The test function itself doesn't seem to directly cause the issue with the `nonsingular` function. However, the parameters provided in the test case are exactly the same as those in the error message.

Therefore, the critical information from both the test function and the error message is:
- The input parameters of `vmin` and `vmax` are -32768 and 0, respectively.
- The error occurs when calculating `maxabsvalue` using `abs(vmin)` and `abs(vmax)`.
- The error message indicates that an overflow was encountered when taking the scalar absolute of one of these values.

Based on this information, it's evident that the issue is caused by the calculation of maxabsvalue in the `nonsingular` function when dealing with large integer values. This causes an overflow while taking the absolute value of these large integers.

To resolve this issue, the `nonsingular` function's calculations should be modified to handle large integer values appropriately, perhaps by ensuring that the operands are properly cast to float before performing mathematical operations that involve large integer values.

Additionally, the function also needs to import numpy (`import numpy as np`) at the beginning of the function to resolve inconsistencies and ensure the function's correct behavior.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    vmin = float(vmin)
    vmax = float(vmax)

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
``` 

This corrected version of the function includes the necessary import statement for numpy at the beginning of the function and casts the input parameters to float to avoid integer overflow issues.
