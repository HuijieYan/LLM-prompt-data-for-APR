The error message indicates a `RuntimeWarning` that an overflow was encountered in scalar absolute when calculating the maximum absolute value in the `nonsingular` function. This warning originates from the `maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))` line in the `nonsingular` function of the buggy code where the calculation is causing an overflow.

The bug occurs due to the code not accounting for cases where the magnitude of the inputs exceeds the computational limits, causing overflow issues. The improper handling of extreme input values leads to the overflow error during the computation of the maximum absolute value between `vmin` and `vmax`.

To address this issue, the `nonsingular` function needs to be updated to explicitly handle cases where the input values cause overflows or other computational issues. Additionally, the test cases should be extended to cover scenarios with large input values that could potentially lead to overflow warnings, verifying the robustness and reliability of the function under various input conditions.

Here's the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function that addresses the overflow issue:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    abs_vmin = abs(vmin)
    abs_vmax = abs(vmax)

    if abs_vmin < tiny or abs_vmax < tiny:
        return -expander, expander  # Return the expanded endpoints

    maxabsvalue = max(abs_vmin, abs_vmax)

    if vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs_vmin
            vmax += expander * abs_vmax

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected version, the maximum absolute value is calculated using pre-calculated absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax` (`abs_vmin` and `abs_vmax`) to avoid the overflow issue. Additionally, the handling of very small absolute values is improved to ensure reliable computation. These modifications address the potential overflow and improve the stability of the function.
