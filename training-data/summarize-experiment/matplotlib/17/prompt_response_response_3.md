The error in the `nonsingular` function is related to the calculation of `maxabsvalue` and the handling of input types. The function is dependent on numpy (`np` was seen in the code) but the module is not imported in the function, leading to inconsistencies between the expected and actual performance of the function.

The potential error location in the function is the calculation of `maxabsvalue`, specifically the usage of `abs()` on integer values without proper casting to float, which leads to overflow issues.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to handle large integer values appropriately. Additionally, the function should explicitly cast the input parameters to float to prevent type inconsistencies and to ensure that the calculations are performed as intended.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """
    
    import numpy as np  # Import numpy module

    # Cast input parameters to float
    vmin, vmax = float(vmin), float(vmax)

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    # Swap vmin and vmax if necessary
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))  # Calculate maximum absolute value

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:  # Check threshold condition
        vmin = -expander  # Update vmin
        vmax = expander  # Update vmax

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:  # Check interval size condition
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander  # Update vmin
            vmax = expander  # Update vmax
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)  # Update vmin
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)  # Update vmax

    if vmax < vmin and not increasing:  # Swap back if necessary
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax  # Return updated endpoints
```

The corrected function now properly imports the numpy module, casts the input parameters to float, and handles large integer values appropriately. This should address the issues identified and resolve the bug in the `nonsingular` function.
