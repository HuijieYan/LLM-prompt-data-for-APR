The bug in the `nonsingular` function is caused by the potential for overflow when calculating the maximum absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax`. This can occur when the magnitude of the input values is very large, leading to precision issues and triggering overflow warnings during the computation of `maxabsvalue`.

To address this issue, the function should handle cases where the input values lead to potential overflow in the calculation of `maxabsvalue`. One possible approach is to conditionally normalize the values of `vmin` and `vmax` before calculating `maxabsvalue`. This can prevent the overflow issues and ensure the accurate computation of `maxabsvalue`.

Here's the revised version of the `nonsingular` function that resolves the overflow bug:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    norm_vmin = vmin / (1 + np.abs(vmin))
    norm_vmax = vmax / (1 + np.abs(vmax))
    maxabsvalue = max(abs(norm_vmin), abs(norm_vmax))

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
```

In the revised version:
- Before calculating `maxabsvalue`, both `vmin` and `vmax` are normalized to prevent potential overflow issues.
- The normalization involves dividing each value by `1 + abs(value)`, ensuring that the magnitude of the input values does not lead to precision problems during the computation of `maxabsvalue`.

By implementing these changes, the revised `nonsingular` function addresses the potential overflow issue and provides more robust handling of large input values. This corrected version can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.
