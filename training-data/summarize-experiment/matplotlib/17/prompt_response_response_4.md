Based on the provided information and analysis, the potential error in the `nonsingular` function occurs in the calculation of `maxabsvalue` when dealing with large integer values. This causes an overflow when taking the absolute value of these large integers.

To resolve this issue, the calculations in the `nonsingular` function should be modified to handle large integer values appropriately, perhaps by ensuring that the operands are properly cast to float before performing mathematical operations that involve large integer values. Additionally, the function should import the `numpy` module at the beginning to ensure that it can utilize numpy functions and data types.

Here is the corrected version of the `nonsingular` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(float(vmin)), abs(float(vmax)))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander * abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander * abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax
``` 

With these modifications, the function should now handle large integer values appropriately and avoid the overflow error when taking absolute values. Additionally, it properly imports the `numpy` module for use in the function. This revised version can be used as a drop-in replacement for the original `nonsingular` function.
