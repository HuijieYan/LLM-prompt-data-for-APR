Based on the provided function code and the expected return values in the test cases, let's examine the core logic of the `nonsingular` function.

The function `nonsingular` takes in 5 input parameters: `vmin`, `vmax`, `expander`, `tiny`, and `increasing`. It then modifies the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities and returns the modified endpoints.

The function executes the following steps:

1. Check if either `vmin` or `vmax` is not finite (i.e., inf or NaN). If so, the function returns `-expander`, `expander`.
2. If `vmax` is less than `vmin`, the values of `vmin` and `vmax` are swapped, and the variable `swapped` is set to `True`.
3. Calculate the maximum absolute value (`maxabsvalue`) between `vmin` and `vmax`.
4. Based on the value of `maxabsvalue`, the function performs the following operations:
   - If `maxabsvalue` is less than a threshold value (`1e6 / tiny` multiplied by the minimum positive normalized value of `float` type), `vmin` and `vmax` are set to `-expander` and `expander` respectively.
   - If the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is less than or equal to `maxabsvalue` multiplied by `tiny`, adjustments are made to `vmin` and `vmax` based on certain conditions.
5. Finally, if the `swapped` flag is `True` and `increasing` is `False`, `vmin` and `vmax` are swapped again before being returned.

Based on the expected return values in the test cases:
- For Case 1, the function should check and return the original endpoints without modification, as the interval ratio and absolute endpoints are within the acceptable thresholds.
- For Case 2, the function should modify the endpoints because the interval ratio is too large based on the `tiny` threshold.
- For Case 3, the function should swap the endpoints and expand them because the interval ratio is too small based on the `tiny` threshold.
- For Case 4, the function should return `-expander`, `expander` due to the presence of infinite values.

In conclusion, the `nonsingular` function is designed to modify the endpoints of a range, avoiding singularities by adjusting them based on specific conditions related to the input parameters. It primarily involves checks for finite values, swapping and modifying endpoints, and adjusting based on the interval ratio and absolute endpoints.
