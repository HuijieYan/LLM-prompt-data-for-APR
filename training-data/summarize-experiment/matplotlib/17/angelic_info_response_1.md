Based on the source code of the function and the expected return values in the tests, here is a comprehensive analysis of the function's logic:

1. The function `nonsingular` takes five input parameters: `vmin`, `vmax`, `expander`, `tiny`, and `increasing`.

2. It first checks if either `vmin` or `vmax` is not finite. If this condition is met, the function returns `-expander` and `expander`.

3. It then checks if `vmax` is less than `vmin` and swaps them if necessary, while setting a boolean variable `swapped` to `True` if this swap occurs.

4. Next, it calculates the maximum absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax` and stores it in the variable `maxabsvalue`.

5. It then evaluates two conditions:
    a) If `maxabsvalue` is less than a specific threshold, the function sets `vmin` to `-expander` and `vmax` to `expander`.
    b) If the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is smaller than another threshold, the function expands the range based on the value of `expander`.

6. Finally, if `swapped` is `True` and `increasing` is `False`, it swaps `vmin` and `vmax`.

Based on the analyses of individual cases, it is evident that the function `nonsingular` modifies the input range to avoid singularities based on the defined conditions and constraints using the input parameters provided. The function performs checks and modifications to ensure that the endpoints are valid and fit the specified criteria.

The function primarily manipulates the input endpoints, applies conditional modifications based on the provided thresholds, and selectively swaps the endpoints under certain conditions. The return values are determined based on the checks and modifications performed on the input parameters.
