The `nonsingular` function takes in parameters `vmin` and `vmax`, which are the initial endpoints of a range, and modifies them as needed to avoid singularities. The function also has optional parameters `expander` and `tiny`, both defaulting to specific values, and `increasing`, a boolean attribute that defaults to True.

The function first checks if either `vmin` or `vmax` is infinite. If so, it returns `(-expander, expander)`. Then it checks if `vmax` is less than `vmin`. If it is, it swaps the two and sets a `swapped` flag to True.

Next, the function calculates the maximum absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax` and stores it in `maxabsvalue`. If this value is less than a threshold calculated based on `tiny`, it sets `vmin` to `-expander` and `vmax` to `expander`.

If the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is within a threshold based on `tiny`, it checks if both `vmax` and `vmin` are 0. If they are, it sets `vmin` to `-expander` and `vmax` to `expander`. Otherwise, it expands `vmin` and `vmax` based on their absolute values and `expander`.

Finally, if the `swapped` flag is True and `increasing` is False, it swaps `vmin` and `vmax` back.

The expected outputs for the test cases indicate that the function is correctly modifying the `vmin` and `vmax` according to the specified conditions.
