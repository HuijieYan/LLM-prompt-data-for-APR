Based on the given test case and error message related to overflow issues in the `nonsingular` function, it is evident that the bug is occurring in the calculation of the maximum absolute value `maxabsvalue`. The function is not handling extreme input values that exceed the computational limits, resulting in overflow errors.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the calculation of `maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))`. This operation can cause overflow errors when the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax` are very large.

To resolve this bug, we can implement a more robust approach for calculating the maximum absolute value. One possible approach is to use conditional checks to compare absolute values while safeguarding against potential overflow errors.

Here's the corrected code for the `nonsingular` function:

```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    abs_vmin = abs(vmin)
    abs_vmax = abs(vmax)
    maxabsvalue = max(abs_vmin, abs_vmax)

    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs_vmin
            vmax += expander*abs_vmax

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin

    return vmin, vmax
```

In the corrected code, we have introduced `abs_vmin` and `abs_vmax` variables to store the absolute values of `vmin` and `vmax` respectively. The `maxabsvalue` is then calculated based on these variables. This approach helps prevent potential overflow issues when dealing with extreme input values.

The revised `nonsingular` function should now handle extreme input values more reliably and avoid the overflow errors encountered in the previous implementation.
