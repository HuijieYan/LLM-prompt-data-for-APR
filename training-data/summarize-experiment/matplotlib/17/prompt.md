Please correct the malfunctioning function provided below by using the relevant information listed to address this bug. Then, produce a revised version of the function that resolves the issue. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
import numpy as np
```

The following is the buggy function that you need to fix:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.

## Test Functions and Error Messages Summary
The followings are test functions under directory `lib/matplotlib/tests/test_colorbar.py` in the project.
```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize("clim", [(-20000, 20000), (-32768, 0)])
def test_colorbar_int(clim):
    # Check that we cast to float early enough to not

    # run into ``abs(int16(-32768)) == -32768``.
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    im = ax.imshow([[*map(np.int16, clim)]])
    fig.colorbar(im)
    assert (im.norm.vmin, im.norm.vmax) == clim

@pytest.mark.parametrize("clim", [(-20000, 20000), (-32768, 0)])
def test_colorbar_int(clim):
    # Check that we cast to float early enough to not
    # overflow ``int16(20000) - int16(-20000)`` or
    # run into ``abs(int16(-32768)) == -32768``.
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    im = ax.imshow([[*map(np.int16, clim)]])
    fig.colorbar(im)
    assert (im.norm.vmin, im.norm.vmax) == clim
```

Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:
The error message indicates a `RuntimeWarning` that an overflow was encountered in scalar absolute when calculating the maximum absolute value in the `nonsingular` function. This warning originates from the `maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))` line in the `nonsingular` function of the buggy code where the calculation is causing an overflow.

This overflow issue is surfacing due to the large values of `vmin` and `vmax` being passed into the `nonsingular` function. In this specific instance, `vmin = -32768` and `vmax = 0`, which triggers the aforementioned overflow warning. Consequently, the code execution fails to process `maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))` due to the excessively large value of `vmin`.

It is evident that the `nonsingular` function is not accounting for cases where the magnitude of the inputs exceeds the computational limits. This demonstrates that the implementation of the function requires explicit handling for extreme input values.

In the test code, the `test_colorbar_int` test function is being used to validate the functionality of a color bar, and it expects that the `vmin` and `vmax` values of the color map are consistent with the predefined `clim` values. This ensures that the generation of the color map and the associated color bar reflect the specified range of data. However, during the execution of `fig.colorbar(im)` in the `test_colorbar_int` function, the overflow warning is triggered due to the underlying call to the `nonsingular` function as described earlier.

To address this issue, the `nonsingular` function should be adapted to handle cases where the input values cause overflows or other computational issues. Additionally, the test cases should be extended to explicitly cover scenarios with large input values that could potentially lead to overflow warnings. This will help to ascertain the robustness and reliability of the color bar generation process under various input conditions.

## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

Based on the provided function code and the expected return values in the test cases, let's examine the core logic of the `nonsingular` function.

The function `nonsingular` takes in 5 input parameters: `vmin`, `vmax`, `expander`, `tiny`, and `increasing`. It then modifies the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities and returns the modified endpoints.

The function executes the following steps:

1. Check if either `vmin` or `vmax` is not finite (i.e., inf or NaN). If so, the function returns `-expander`, `expander`.
2. If `vmax` is less than `vmin`, the values of `vmin` and `vmax` are swapped, and the variable `swapped` is set to `True`.
3. Calculate the maximum absolute value (`maxabsvalue`) between `vmin` and `vmax`.
4. Based on the value of `maxabsvalue`, the function performs the following operations:
   - If `maxabsvalue` is less than a threshold value (`1e6 / tiny` multiplied by the minimum positive normalized value of `float` type), `vmin` and `vmax` are set to `-expander` and `expander` respectively.
   - If the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is less than or equal to `maxabsvalue` multiplied by `tiny`, adjustments are made to `vmin` and `vmax` based on certain conditions.
5. Finally, if the `swapped` flag is `True` and `increasing` is `False`, `vmin` and `vmax` are swapped again before being returned.

Based on the expected return values in the test cases:
- For Case 1, the function should check and return the original endpoints without modification, as the interval ratio and absolute endpoints are within the acceptable thresholds.
- For Case 2, the function should modify the endpoints because the interval ratio is too large based on the `tiny` threshold.
- For Case 3, the function should swap the endpoints and expand them because the interval ratio is too small based on the `tiny` threshold.
- For Case 4, the function should return `-expander`, `expander` due to the presence of infinite values.

In conclusion, the `nonsingular` function is designed to modify the endpoints of a range, avoiding singularities by adjusting them based on specific conditions related to the input parameters. It primarily involves checks for finite values, swapping and modifying endpoints, and adjusting based on the interval ratio and absolute endpoints.
