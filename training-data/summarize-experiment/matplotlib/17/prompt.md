Please correct the malfunctioning function provided below by using the relevant information listed to address this bug. Then, produce a revised version of the function that resolves the issue. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
import numpy as np
```

The following is the buggy function that you need to fix:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.

## Test Case Summary
The given source code of the function `nonsingular` along with the error messages indicates a bug related to a `RuntimeWarning` of overflow encountered in scalar absolute.

The test function `test_colorbar_int` in the `test_colorbar.py` file seems to be indirectly invoking the `nonsingular` function. The function performs modifications of the endpoints of a range to avoid singularities. The error message highlights overflow warning and inconsistent behavior in the `nonsingular` function as well as when calling it in the test functions. The issue specifically occurs in the computation of the `maxabsvalue` variable.

To fix the problem, focus on examining the computation of `maxabsvalue` and the underlying fundamental mechanism of the `nonsingular` function.

Reference the code in the `nonsingular`:

```python
maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
```

This line is the cause of the issue, as it is attempting to find the maximum absolute value between `vmin` and `vmax` using the `max` and `abs` functions. The error stems from overflow when computing the absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax`.

To address this problem and prevent overflow, consider modifying the computation of `maxabsvalue`.

```python
maxabsvalue = abs(max(vmin, vmax))
```

By swapping the positions of `max` and `abs` in the above line, the function will now find the maximum of `vmin` and `vmax` first and then apply the absolute function.

After making this modification, run the test functions again, specifically `test_colorbar_int`, to ensure that the `nonsingular` function is working as expected without any overflow warnings.



## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

In the provided buggy function, called `nonsingular`, I've observed several test cases along with their input parameters and the runtime values and types of key variables at the moment the function returns. Let's analyze each case and see how it relates to the function's code.

### Buggy case 1
In this case, the input parameters `vmin` and `vmax` are both integers. When the function returns, both `vmin` and `vmax` have been converted to floats, indicating that they were modified by the function.

The function checks if either `vmin` or `vmax` is not finite. In this case, since both are finite, this condition is not met. The function then checks if `vmax` is less than `vmin`, which is not the case here, so the swapping condition is also not met. Then, it calculates `maxabsvalue` as the maximum absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax`, which is 1.0.

Since the interval between `vmin` and `vmax` does not meet the conditions for either of the subsequent if statements, we see that the outputs `vmin` and `vmax` remain the same as the inputs in this case.

### Buggy case 2
In this case, both the input parameters and the key variables `swapped` and `maxabsvalue` after the buggy function's return are consistent with the correct execution of the function. 

### Buggy case 3
In this case, the input parameters `vmin` and `vmax` are both floats. When the function returns, both `vmin` and `vmax` have been modified. `swapped` is also modified from `False` to `True`.

Once the inputs go through the initial checks for finiteness, the function finds that `vmax` is less than `vmin` and swaps them. It then calculates `maxabsvalue` as the maximum absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax`, which is 0.5.

The subsequent if statement is then executed, modifying `vmin` and `vmax` according to certain conditions. This leads to `vmin` and `vmax` being swapped back right before the return due to the `swapped` condition being met. 

### Buggy case 4
Here, both `vmin` and `vmax` are finite, so the function returns the inputs unchanged.

### Buggy case 5
In this case, the input parameters are integers, but after the function returns, they have been converted to floats. This is unexpected behavior.

The function checks for finiteness of inputs, then calculates `maxabsvalue` as the maximum absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax`, which is 20000.0.

Since the interval between `vmin` and `vmax` meets none of the necessary conditions, the outputs are the same as the inputs.

### Buggy case 6 and 7
Both these cases involve similar scenarios where the inputs and key variables are consistent with expected behavior. No unexpected modifications to the inputs are observed.

### Buggy case 8
Here, the key variables remain consistent with expected behavior, and no unexpected modifications to the inputs are observed.

After closely examining the observed variable values in the test cases in conjunction with the function's code, it's clear that the function is not behaving as expected in some cases. The behavior of converting integer inputs to floats and modification of inputs when such modification is not expected indicate potentially buggy behavior. Additionally, the unexpected conversion of int16 inputs to float64 is observed which may indicate precision or typecasting issues.

This analysis highlights the necessity for further debugging and potentially refining the code to ensure consistent, predictable behavior across different input scenarios.



## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

Based on the source code of the function and the expected return values in the tests, here is a comprehensive analysis of the function's logic:

1. The function `nonsingular` takes five input parameters: `vmin`, `vmax`, `expander`, `tiny`, and `increasing`.

2. It first checks if either `vmin` or `vmax` is not finite. If this condition is met, the function returns `-expander` and `expander`.

3. It then checks if `vmax` is less than `vmin` and swaps them if necessary, while setting a boolean variable `swapped` to `True` if this swap occurs.

4. Next, it calculates the maximum absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax` and stores it in the variable `maxabsvalue`.

5. It then evaluates two conditions:
    a) If `maxabsvalue` is less than a specific threshold, the function sets `vmin` to `-expander` and `vmax` to `expander`.
    b) If the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is smaller than another threshold, the function expands the range based on the value of `expander`.

6. Finally, if `swapped` is `True` and `increasing` is `False`, it swaps `vmin` and `vmax`.

Based on the analyses of individual cases, it is evident that the function `nonsingular` modifies the input range to avoid singularities based on the defined conditions and constraints using the input parameters provided. The function performs checks and modifications to ensure that the endpoints are valid and fit the specified criteria.

The function primarily manipulates the input endpoints, applies conditional modifications based on the provided thresholds, and selectively swaps the endpoints under certain conditions. The return values are determined based on the checks and modifications performed on the input parameters.
