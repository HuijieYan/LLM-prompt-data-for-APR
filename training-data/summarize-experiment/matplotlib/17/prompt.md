Please correct the malfunctioning function provided below by using the relevant information listed to address this bug. Then, produce a revised version of the function that resolves the issue. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
import numpy as np
```

The following is the buggy function that you need to fix:
```python
def nonsingular(vmin, vmax, expander=0.001, tiny=1e-15, increasing=True):
    """
    Modify the endpoints of a range as needed to avoid singularities.

    Parameters
    ----------
    vmin, vmax : float
        The initial endpoints.
    expander : float, default: 0.001
        Fractional amount by which *vmin* and *vmax* are expanded if
        the original interval is too small, based on *tiny*.
    tiny : float, default: 1e-15
        Threshold for the ratio of the interval to the maximum absolute
        value of its endpoints.  If the interval is smaller than
        this, it will be expanded.  This value should be around
        1e-15 or larger; otherwise the interval will be approaching
        the double precision resolution limit.
    increasing : bool, default: True
        If True, swap *vmin*, *vmax* if *vmin* > *vmax*.

    Returns
    -------
    vmin, vmax : float
        Endpoints, expanded and/or swapped if necessary.
        If either input is inf or NaN, or if both inputs are 0 or very
        close to zero, it returns -*expander*, *expander*.
    """

    if (not np.isfinite(vmin)) or (not np.isfinite(vmax)):
        return -expander, expander

    swapped = False
    if vmax < vmin:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
        swapped = True

    maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))
    if maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny:
        vmin = -expander
        vmax = expander

    elif vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny:
        if vmax == 0 and vmin == 0:
            vmin = -expander
            vmax = expander
        else:
            vmin -= expander*abs(vmin)
            vmax += expander*abs(vmax)

    if swapped and not increasing:
        vmin, vmax = vmax, vmin
    return vmin, vmax

## Test Functions and Error Messages Summary
The followings are test functions under directory `lib/matplotlib/tests/test_colorbar.py` in the project.
```python
@pytest.mark.parametrize("clim", [(-20000, 20000), (-32768, 0)])
def test_colorbar_int(clim):
    # Check that we cast to float early enough to not
    # overflow ``int16(20000) - int16(-20000)`` or
    # run into ``abs(int16(-32768)) == -32768``.
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    im = ax.imshow([[*map(np.int16, clim)]])
    fig.colorbar(im)
    assert (im.norm.vmin, im.norm.vmax) == clim

@pytest.mark.parametrize("clim", [(-20000, 20000), (-32768, 0)])
def test_colorbar_int(clim):
    # Check that we cast to float early enough to not
    # overflow ``int16(20000) - int16(-20000)`` or
    # run into ``abs(int16(-32768)) == -32768``.
    fig, ax = plt.subplots()
    im = ax.imshow([[*map(np.int16, clim)]])
    fig.colorbar(im)
    assert (im.norm.vmin, im.norm.vmax) == clim
```

Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:
Based on the test function and the error message, it's clear that the `nonsingular` function is throwing an overflow error. This is happening when calculating the `maxabsvalue` variable, specifically when taking the absolute value of either `vmin` or `vmax`. The error message contains the following relevant information:
- "vmin = -32768, vmax = 0, expander = 0.1, tiny = 1e-15, increasing = True"
- The code snippet that contains the error is: `maxabsvalue = max(abs(vmin), abs(vmax))`
- The error message says: `RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar absolute`
  
The test function itself doesn't seem to directly cause the issue with the `nonsingular` function. However, the parameters provided in the test case are exactly the same as those in the error message.

Therefore, the critical information from both the test function and the error message is:
- The input parameters of `vmin` and `vmax` are -32768 and 0, respectively.
- The error occurs when calculating `maxabsvalue` using `abs(vmin)` and `abs(vmax)`.
- The error message indicates that an overflow was encountered when taking the scalar absolute of one of these values.

Based on this information, it's evident that the issue is caused by the calculation of maxabsvalue in the `nonsingular` function when dealing with large integer values. This causes an overflow while taking the absolute value of these large integers.

To resolve this issue, the `nonsingular` function's calculations should be modified to handle large integer values appropriately, perhaps by ensuring that the operands are properly cast to float before performing mathematical operations that involve large integer values.



## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

Looking at the function code and the variable logs, we can see several issues that might be the cause of the buggy behavior.

In the first case, the input parameters are integers, but the function expects floats. The function's initial check for finite values will fail, as it explicitly checks for `np.isfinite` (numpy's finite value test). This would lead to the return of `-expander`, `expander`, which is inconsistent with the observed output values in the log.

Additionally, the condition `maxabsvalue < (1e6 / tiny) * np.finfo(float).tiny` is false for maxabsvalue = 1.0, which means the subsequent condition `vmax - vmin <= maxabsvalue * tiny` should be evaluated. This condition evaluates to true, but the execution doesn't follow the expected behavior, which indicates a potential problem with this part of the code.

In the second case, the input and output values are consistent, so let's not focus on this case.

In the third case, the fact that `maxabsvalue` is 0.5, and `vmin` and `vmax` are correctly switched and updated based on the conditions, but still an inconsistency is observed after swapping, indicates that the problem might be related to the swapping condition.

In the fourth case, the behavior indicates that the initial condition for checking finite values is not being executed correctly since the return should be `-expander`, `expander`, but the observed output values are different.

In the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth cases, the code returns the expected output for all the inputs given. This indicates that the function is correct in these cases.

The most probable cause of the bug is that the function is dependent on numpy (`np` was seen in the code) but the module is not imported in the function, leading to inconsistencies between the expected and actual performance of the function.

To debug the issues, the `import numpy as np` statement should be added at the beginning of the function. The function's handling of input types should also be reviewed to ensure consistency and accuracy.

After addressing these issues, the function should be retested with the problematic cases to verify that the bug has been fixed.



## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

The `nonsingular` function takes in parameters `vmin` and `vmax`, which are the initial endpoints of a range, and modifies them as needed to avoid singularities. The function also has optional parameters `expander` and `tiny`, both defaulting to specific values, and `increasing`, a boolean attribute that defaults to True.

The function first checks if either `vmin` or `vmax` is infinite. If so, it returns `(-expander, expander)`. Then it checks if `vmax` is less than `vmin`. If it is, it swaps the two and sets a `swapped` flag to True.

Next, the function calculates the maximum absolute value of `vmin` and `vmax` and stores it in `maxabsvalue`. If this value is less than a threshold calculated based on `tiny`, it sets `vmin` to `-expander` and `vmax` to `expander`.

If the difference between `vmax` and `vmin` is within a threshold based on `tiny`, it checks if both `vmax` and `vmin` are 0. If they are, it sets `vmin` to `-expander` and `vmax` to `expander`. Otherwise, it expands `vmin` and `vmax` based on their absolute values and `expander`.

Finally, if the `swapped` flag is True and `increasing` is False, it swaps `vmin` and `vmax` back.

The expected outputs for the test cases indicate that the function is correctly modifying the `vmin` and `vmax` according to the specified conditions.
