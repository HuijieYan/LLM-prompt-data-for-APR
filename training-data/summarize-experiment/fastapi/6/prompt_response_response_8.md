The error encountered in the test case seems to be related to the handling of repeated key-value pairs in the form data. The buggy function `request_body_to_args` processes the `received_body` by extracting values corresponding to the `required_params`. However, as highlighted in the GitHub issue, the current approach does not support collecting repeated keys and assigning those values as a list before validation.

The potential error location in the function is the section where it processes the `received_body` for sequence-shaped fields and assigns values to the `values` dictionary.

The bug occurs because the function is not designed to handle repeated key-value pairs that should be converted into a list for validation. To fix this bug, the function should be updated to correctly handle repeated keys and construct the `values` and `errors` based on the collected values.

The possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the logic that processes the `received_body` for sequence-shaped fields. Instead of directly assigning the value to the `values` dictionary, repeated keys should be collected and converted into a list before further processing. Additionally, the logic for error handling should be updated to handle the validation of lists and other sequences.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    values_list = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    if values_list:
                        value = values_list
                    else:
                        value = received_body.get(field.alias)  # For non-repeated key
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue

            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                    # Read values for files in a sequence and convert to a list
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = list(contents)
                else:
                    value = await value.read()

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    
    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function:
- Repeated keys from the `received_body` are now collected and converted into a list before further processing, ensuring that all values are considered for validation.
- The logic for handling file-shaped fields within a sequence is also updated to correctly process the values and construct a list if necessary.
- Error handling is updated to handle the validation of lists and other sequences.

Overall, this fixes the bug in the function and ensures that repeated key-value pairs are properly handled and validated.
