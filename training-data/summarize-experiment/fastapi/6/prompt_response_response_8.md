Based on the provided information and the analysis of the buggy function, it appears that the function is correctly handling the processing and validation of form data for different field types (list, set, tuple). The observed behavior and runtime variables within the function align with the expected logic for mapping values to the corresponding field aliases.

Given the context provided, the root cause of the test case failures may not be directly attributed to the `request_body_to_args` function. Further investigation into the test setup, input data, and potential discrepancies in the test cases could provide insights into the cause of the unexpected status code received in the failed test.

Considering the proposed enhancement related to the handling of repeated key=value pairs in form data, the fix for the bug may involve incorporating the suggested approach to gather repeated keys and assign their values as a list before the validation process. This improvement could enable more comprehensive validation against all provided values, addressing the limitation identified in the bug.

The corrected code for the problematic function `request_body_to_args`, incorporating the suggested enhancement, is as follows:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    # Modified to handle repeated keys and assign values as a list
                    if field.alias in received_body:
                        value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    else:
                        value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            # Remaining validation logic remains unchanged
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In this revised version of the function, the processing logic has been adjusted to handle repeated keys and assign their values as a list when using FormData. This enhancement aligns with the proposed solution to address the bug and enables more comprehensive validation against all provided values.

This corrected code can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the `request_body_to_args` function. It incorporates the proposed enhancement to address the limitations identified in the bug and improve the handling of form data with repeated key=value pairs.
