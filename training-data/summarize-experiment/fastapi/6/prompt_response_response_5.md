Based on the analysis, the bug is not directly related to the function `request_body_to_args`. The function appears to handle and set the values correctly for different types (list, set, tuple) based on the received body. It constructs the `values` dictionary and populates it efficiently based on the field types and required parameters. The `errors` list remains empty, indicating successful processing without any errors.

The issue causing the failed test cases might not be directly attributed to the `request_body_to_args` function. Further investigation is required to identify the root cause of the test case failures, potentially involving review of the failed test cases, input data, expected behavior, error logs, or discrepancies in the test cases.

Given the information provided, the issue with the function `request_body_to_args` is not apparent. It is advisable to inspect the higher-level integration and usage of this function within the application in order to identify any potential issues related to its invocation and usage.

Regarding potential approaches for fixing the bug, it is recommended to first investigate the specific causes of the unexpected behavior and test failures. This may involve examining the interaction between the function, the input data, and the broader application context. Once the specific issues causing the failures are identified, appropriate modifications to the function or the test cases can be implemented.

In the absence of a directly identifiable bug within the function, the corrected code for the function `request_body_to_args` is provided below for reference:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias) if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData) else received_body.get(field.alias)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

It's important to note that without a clear indication of the specific issues causing the test failures, the provided corrected code may not fully address the underlying problems. Further investigation and context about the failures are needed to provide a more accurate and targeted solution.
