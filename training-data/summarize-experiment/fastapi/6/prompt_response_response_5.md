The test case indicates that the expected status code is 200, but the actual status code is 422. This mismatch suggests that the request sent to the server did not meet the validation requirements, causing the server to return a 422 status code (unprocessable entity). This discrepancy is likely due to a validation issue within the `request_body_to_args` function that processes the form data.

Upon reviewing the code, it appears that the issue may stem from the handling of repeated key-value pairs in form data. In the provided function, the handling of repeated keys in form data is not accounted for, leading to the last key-value pair winning, which results in incorrect validation and the server returning a 422 status code.

To fix this issue, the function needs to be updated to appropriately handle repeated key-value pairs in the form data. This can be achieved by modifying the logic for processing form data, specifically for the cases where the same key has multiple values associated with it.

The corrected code for the `request_body_to_args` function is provided below:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                received_body, FormData
            ):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if value is None:
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                if isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                    value = await value.read()
                elif isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the revised version of the function, the handling of repeated key-value pairs in form data has been updated to correctly process and validate the input. Specifically, when the form data contains repeated keys, the function now properly retrieves the associated values and processes them accordingly, ensuring that all values for the same key are considered during validation.

This updated function resolves the issue related to form data validation and should now correctly handle repeated key-value pairs, addressing the bug identified in the original function.
