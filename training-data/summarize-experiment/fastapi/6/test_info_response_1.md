The error message points to the failed assertion in the test function `test_python_tuple_param_as_form()`. Specifically, the assertion `assert response.status_code == 200` is what failed. The error message indicates that the expected status code was 200, but the actual status code received was 422.

In order to understand why the test failed, let's examine the context in which this test is being executed: `client.post("/form/python-tuple", data={"items": ["first", "second", "third"]})`. This suggests that the test is sending a POST request to a specific route with form data, and then expecting the response status code to be 200.

The code snippet, which is part of the function `request_body_to_args`, is responsible for processing form data:
```python
if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
else:
    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
```
The code shows that if the `field.shape` is in `sequence_shapes` and the `received_body` is an instance of `FormData`, then `value` is assigned the result of `received_body.getlist(field.alias)`. Otherwise, `value` is assigned the result of `received_body.get(field.alias)`.

From the test function, we know that the route `/form/python-tuple` is being invoked with form data `{"items": ["first", "second", "third"]}`. Therefore, the relevant portion of the code in `request_body_to_args` is likely attempting to retrieve the value associated with the key `"items"` from the form data.

To diagnose this specific failure, we need to understand why the response status code is 422 instead of the expected 200. However, the error message provided does not explicitly provide the reason for the 422 status code. Further examination of the response body or additional logging in the tested route could provide more insight into the cause of the unexpected status code.

In summary, the failed test case indicates that the response status code received was 422 instead of the expected 200. The relevant function being tested involves processing form data and extracting values based on specific conditions. The exact reason for the unexpected status code requires further investigation.
