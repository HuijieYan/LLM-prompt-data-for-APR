# Summary:
The issue at hand pertains to the handling of repeated key=value pairs in form data. The problem arises when a URL encoded data contains multiple occurrences of the same key, resulting in only the last key=value winning. This behavior does not align with the expected functionality, as it restricts the ability to validate against all values.

The suggested solution proposes that FastAPI should gather repeated keys in a 2-tuple list and assign those values as a list to the same key before the validation process occurs. This approach would enable more comprehensive and accurate validation against all the provided values.

In essence, the bug revolves around the inadequate handling of repeated key=value pairs, leading to limited validation capabilities. The proposed solution aims to address this issue by enhancing the data aggregation and validation process within FastAPI.
