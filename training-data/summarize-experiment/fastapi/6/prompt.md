Please correct the malfunctioning function provided below by using the relevant information listed to address this bug. Then, produce a revised version of the function that resolves the issue. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python

## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The buggy function, `request_body_to_args`, is designed to validate and process request body data against a list of required parameter fields. It consumes a list of `required_params` and `received_body`, which are used to construct `values` and `errors`.

Looking at the logs from the buggy cases:

In Buggy Case 1:
- It is observed that the `required_params` is of type list containing a single ModelField 'items' with type list and is marked as required.
- The `received_body` is a FormData containing multiple entries with the key 'items'.
- The value of `values` at the end contains a key 'items' with a list of items.
- The value of `errors` is an empty list.

In Buggy Case 2:
- The `required_params` is similar to Buggy Case 1 but with the type of 'items' being set instead of list.
- The `received_body` is also a FormData.
- The value of `values` contains a key 'items' with a set of items.
- The value of `errors` is an empty list.

In Buggy Case 3:
- Similar to Buggy Case 1, the `required_params` is a list with a single ModelField 'items' with type tuple.
- The `received_body` is a FormData.
- The value of `values` contains a key 'items' with a tuple of items.
- The value of `errors` is an empty list.

Analyzing the function:
- The function first initializes `values` as an empty dictionary and `errors` as an empty list.
- It then checks if `required_params` is not empty. If it's not, it proceeds to process each field one by one.
- For each field, it extracts the field information and checks if the `received_body` is not None.
- Based on the shape of the field, it extracts values from the `received_body`.
- It then proceeds with further validations and awaits reading/uploading of file data if a file type and updates `values` and `errors` accordingly.

Potential Issues:
- In all buggy cases, the code correctly processes the `received_body` and populates the `values` dictionary based on the content. Therefore, the bug might reside in the part before field validation or the validation itself.
- The usage of `deepcopy` for setting default values in the dictionary and processing of failure cases through errors is ensuring the integrity of the results for `values` and track of errors in `errors`.

To identify the root cause of the failure in the test cases (Buggy Case 1, Buggy Case 2, and Buggy Case 3), a detailed review of the field validation logic is required. Additionally, examining the implementation of the `ModelField` and `get_field_info` would add to understanding how the checks and validations are being handled.

Further analysis is required to identify the specific bugs in the function that are causing test cases to fail. Additional information about the `ModelField` and `get_field_info` will aid in the thorough investigation of this issue.



## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

The function `request_body_to_args` is intended to process input parameters consisting of a list of required model fields and an optional received body. It then returns the values and any associated errors based on the provided inputs.

The function begins by initializing two variables, 'values' as an empty dictionary and 'errors' as an empty list to store any errors encountered during processing.

Through iteration on the required_params list, it processes individual model fields. For each field, the function retrieves the field info and checks to see if the 'embed' attribute is set. If the 'embed' attribute is not set, it proceeds to manipulate the received_body based on the field's alias.

The value is then obtained from the received_body based on the field's alias. If the value is not present (or satisfies certain conditions), an error may be appended to the 'errors' list. Otherwise, the field's value is validated, and if errors are encountered, they are added to the 'errors' list, otherwise, the value is added to the 'values' dictionary.

The function ultimately returns the 'values' and 'errors' lists, representing the processed field values and any errors encountered during processing, respectively.

The analysis of the expected return value for each test case further illustrates this function's core logic. It shows how the input parameters in the function relate to the expected 'values' and 'errors' lists, showcasing the specific behavior and outcomes of the function's processing.



# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
Support repeated key=value in form data
```

## The associated detailed issue description
```text
Is your feature request related to a problem
Yes.

Given some URL encoded data like this...

choices=parrot&choices=spider
...only the last key=value wins.

This does not work like I expected:

choices: list = Form(...)
You can only validate against the last value.

The solution you would like
Perhaps FastAPI should collect repeated keys in the 2-tuple list that request.form() gives and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation happens.
```
