The function `request_body_to_args` is intended to process input parameters consisting of a list of required model fields and an optional received body. It then returns the values and any associated errors based on the provided inputs.

The function begins by initializing two variables, 'values' as an empty dictionary and 'errors' as an empty list to store any errors encountered during processing.

Through iteration on the required_params list, it processes individual model fields. For each field, the function retrieves the field info and checks to see if the 'embed' attribute is set. If the 'embed' attribute is not set, it proceeds to manipulate the received_body based on the field's alias.

The value is then obtained from the received_body based on the field's alias. If the value is not present (or satisfies certain conditions), an error may be appended to the 'errors' list. Otherwise, the field's value is validated, and if errors are encountered, they are added to the 'errors' list, otherwise, the value is added to the 'values' dictionary.

The function ultimately returns the 'values' and 'errors' lists, representing the processed field values and any errors encountered during processing, respectively.

The analysis of the expected return value for each test case further illustrates this function's core logic. It shows how the input parameters in the function relate to the expected 'values' and 'errors' lists, showcasing the specific behavior and outcomes of the function's processing.
