The error message associated with the third test case indicates that the response status code is 422 instead of the expected 200. This discrepancy suggests that there might be an issue with the validation or processing of the input data within the `request_body_to_args` function, potentially leading to incorrect output values and status codes.

Upon analyzing the buggy function, it seems that the issue may be related to the processing of form data containing repeated keys. The test cases involve passing data with a key 'items' and multiple values, which may not be handled correctly within the current implementation of the function.

One potential reason for the bug could be that the function does not handle repeated keys in form data properly. When data with repeated keys is passed, the function might only process the last key=value pair, leading to incorrect output values and status codes.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to modify the function to handle repeated keys in form data and properly collect and assign those values as a list or other appropriate data structure.

Here's the revised and corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function that addresses the bug:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    for field in required_params:
        value: Any = None
        if received_body is not None:
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                received_body, FormData
            ):
                value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
            else:
                value = received_body.get(field.alias)
        if (
            value is None
            or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
            or (
                isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                and len(value) == 0
            )
        ):
            if field.required:
                errors.append(ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
            else:
                values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            continue
        if (
            isinstance(field_info, params.File)
            and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
            and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
        ):
            value = await value.read()
        elif (
            field.shape in sequence_shapes
            and isinstance(field_info, params.File)
            and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
            and isinstance(value, sequence_types)
        ):
            awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
            contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
            value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)
        v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
        if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
            errors.append(errors_)
        elif isinstance(errors_, list):
            errors.extend(errors_)
        else:
            values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In this revised version of the function, the logic has been updated to properly handle repeated keys in form data, ensuring that all values associated with a particular key are collected and processed accordingly. This should help address the issue encountered in the test cases related to form data with repeated keys.
