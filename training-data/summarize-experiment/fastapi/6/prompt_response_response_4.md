The suspected issue causing the test failures seems to stem from the handling of repeated key=value pairs in form data within the `request_body_to_args` function. The function may not be aggregating the values correctly when multiple occurrences of the same key are present in the form data. This could result in only the last key=value pair being utilized, leading to unexpected behavior in the validation process.

To address this issue, the function should be modified to gather repeated keys along with their respective values and store them as lists within the `values` dictionary. This adjustment would allow for comprehensive validation against all provided values and align with the expected behavior when dealing with repeated key=value pairs in form data.

In order to implement this improvement, the function's logic for handling repeated key=value pairs should be enhanced. Specifically, when encountering multiple occurrences of the same key, the function should aggregate the values into a list and assign the list to the corresponding key within the `values` dictionary. This modification would enable the function to effectively process and validate all values associated with repeated keys.

With these considerations in mind, the revised version of the `request_body_to_args` function is provided below with the necessary updates to address the handling of repeated key=value pairs:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    if field.alias in received_body:  # Check for repeated keys
                        values[field.alias] = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    else:
                        value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            # Validation and error handling logic remains unchanged
            # ...
    return values, errors
```

In this revised version of the function, the handling of repeated keys has been enhanced to gather their respective values as lists and assign them to the associated keys within the `values` dictionary. This modification ensures that all values for repeated keys are aggregated and included in the validation process, addressing the issue related to the handling of repeated key=value pairs in form data.
