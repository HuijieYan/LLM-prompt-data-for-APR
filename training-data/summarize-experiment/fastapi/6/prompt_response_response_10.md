The error message in the test case indicates a status code mismatch, which suggests that the function `request_body_to_args` is not correctly parsing and handling the request body for the given test cases. Upon analyzing the code, it seems that the bug is related to the handling of repeated keys in the form data.

The potential error location within the `request_body_to_args` function is the logic that handles repeated keys in the form data. It appears that the function currently only handles the last value for a repeated key, leading to incorrect processing and validation of the form data.

The bug occurs because the function `request_body_to_args` does not properly handle repeated keys in the form data. When multiple values are associated with the same key in the form data, the function only captures the last value, leading to incorrect validation and processing. This results in mismatched status codes and incorrect JSON response data in the test cases.

To fix the bug, the `request_body_to_args` function needs to be modified to properly collect and handle repeated keys in the form data. It should consolidate all values associated with the same key into a list before validation occurs. Additionally, the function should ensure that it captures and processes all values for repeated keys to provide accurate validation and output data.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                # Handle repeated keys by converting to a list if necessary
                if isinstance(value, list) and len(value) > 1:
                    value = list(value)
                elif lenient_issubclass(field.type_, (list, set, tuple)) and not isinstance(value, (list, set, tuple)):
                    value = [value]  # Convert single value to a list for consistency
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version of the function, the handling of repeated keys in the form data has been improved. It checks for repeated keys and consolidates their values into a list before validation occurs. This ensures that all values associated with repeated keys are properly captured and processed, leading to accurate validation and output data.
