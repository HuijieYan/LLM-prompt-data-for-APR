The error message indicates that the test case is failing because the response status code is expected to be 200, but it is returning a 422 status code instead. This discrepancy suggests that the function `request_body_to_args` is not properly handling the input data in the `test_python_tuple_param_as_form` test case, resulting in an incorrect status code being returned.

Upon reviewing the provided function `request_body_to_args`, it seems that the issue may be related to the handling of repeated keys in the form data. The function needs to properly handle repeated keys and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation occurs.

The bug in the current function appears to be related to the processing of form data with repeated keys. The function should properly handle the scenario where the same key appears multiple times in the form data and collect all the associated values into a list for validation.

To fix this, we can update the logic in the function to handle repeated keys in the form data and collect the values into a list before validation.

Here is the corrected version of the function `request_body_to_args` that addresses the bug:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params and received_body:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if field.alias in received_body:
                field_values = received_body.getlist(field.alias) if isinstance(received_body, FormData) else received_body.get(field.alias)
                if len(field_values) > 1:
                    value = field_values
                else:
                    value = field_values[0]
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            if (
                isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
            ):
                value = await value.read()
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In the revised version of the function, we have added logic to properly handle repeated keys in the form data. If a field has multiple values associated with it, we collect those values into a list and use that list for validation. This modification ensures that the function can handle repeated keys and properly validate the form data.

After making the necessary changes, this corrected function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version to address the issue related to processing form data with repeated keys.
