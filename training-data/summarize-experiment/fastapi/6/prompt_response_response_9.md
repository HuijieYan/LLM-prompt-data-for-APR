The error in the provided function `request_body_to_args` seems to be related to the processing of parameters with repeating keys in form data. It also seems to be associated with the validation process of fields from the form data.

The root cause of the bug lies in how the function processes form data containing repeating keys. It does not handle these repeated keys as expected and only validates against the last value, leading to incorrect validation results and subsequently failing the associated test cases.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be updated to correctly handle form data with repeated keys and ensure that all values associated with the repeated keys are captured and processed during validation.

Here's the revised version of the `request_body_to_args` function that resolves the bug:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    if field.alias in received_body:
                        if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                            value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                        else:
                            value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            if (
                value is None
                or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "")
                or (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.Form)
                    and field.shape in sequence_shapes
                    and len(value) == 0
                )
            ):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            # validation logic remains the same
            # ...
    return values, errors
```

In the revised version, the code has been modified to handle repeated keys in form data correctly. The function now checks for the presence of the field's alias in the received form data and processes all associated values based on the field's shape. This change ensures that all values associated with repeated keys are captured and processed during validation.

The updated function should now correctly handle form data with repeated keys and produce the expected validation results.

This fix may address the issue reported in the test cases and align with the feature request related to the problem of handling repeated key=value pairs in form data.
