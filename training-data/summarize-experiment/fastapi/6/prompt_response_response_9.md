Based on the provided test functions and the associated error message, it seems that the issue lies within the function `request_body_to_args` while processing form data with repeated keys. This results in the function not populating the `values` dictionary correctly, leading to an assertion error in the test.

The bug occurs because the function doesn't handle form data with repeated keys properly. In the case of repeated keys, the function only considers the last key and assigns its value to the field, ignoring the previous values associated with the same key. This behavior leads to incorrect data processing and erroneous validation, resulting in the assertion error observed in the test.

To fix this bug, the function needs to be modified to properly handle form data with repeated keys. When multiple values are associated with the same key in the form data, the function should collect these values into a list before validation takes place. This will ensure that all values associated with the repeated key are processed and validated correctly, resulting in the expected behavior for form data with repeated keys.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_body_to_args` function that addresses the bug:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    repeated_keys = {}
    
    if required_params:
        # Iterate through the required params
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None

            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    # Handle repeated keys
                    if field.alias in repeated_keys:
                        # Append the value to the existing list
                        repeated_keys[field.alias].append(received_body.get(field.alias))
                    else:
                        # Create a new list for the repeated key
                        repeated_keys[field.alias] = [received_body.get(field.alias)]
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)

            # Process the values for repeated keys
            if field.alias in repeated_keys:
                value = repeated_keys[field.alias]

            # Validate the value and handle errors
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In the corrected function, we introduced a `repeated_keys` dictionary to collect values associated with repeated keys from the form data. This ensures that all values associated with the same key are properly collected into a list before validation takes place. This approach addresses the bug by handling form data with repeated keys correctly, resulting in the expected behavior for form fields defined as sequences. After applying this fix, the function should produce the expected output for the given test cases.
