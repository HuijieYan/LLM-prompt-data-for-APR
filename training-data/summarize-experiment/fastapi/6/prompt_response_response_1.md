The error message indicates that the expected status code is 200, but the received status code is 422. This suggests that there might be an issue with the validation of the input data in the function `request_body_to_args`. Since the provided test cases are related to posting form data, the bug might be related to how the function handles form data with multiple values for the same key.

Upon reviewing the function `request_body_to_args`, it seems that the issue might arise from the processing of form data with repeated keys. The function attempts to handle sequence-shaped fields, but it may not handle repeated keys within the form data correctly, leading to incorrect validation and resulting in a 422 status code.

To address this bug, one approach is to modify the logic for handling form data with repeated keys. By collecting repeated keys in the form data and assigning those values as a list to the same key before validation happens, as suggested in the GitHub issue titled "Support repeated key=value in form data," the bug can be resolved.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_body_to_args` function that addresses the bug:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                # Collect repeated keys in form data and assign values as a list
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)

            if value is None and field.required:
                if PYDANTIC_1:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:  # pragma: nocover
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                            MissingError(),
                            loc=("body", field.alias),
                            config=BaseConfig,
                        )
                    )
            else:
                if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, UploadFile):
                    value = await value.read()
                elif isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes) and isinstance(value, sequence_types):
                    awaitables = [sub_value.read() for sub_value in value]
                    contents = await asyncio.gather(*awaitables)
                    value = sequence_shape_to_type[field.shape](contents)

                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

By modifying the logic to handle form data with repeated keys correctly, the corrected function ensures that the validation and processing of form data with multiple values for the same key are handled as expected.

With the provided correction, this revised function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version to address the identified issue related to validating form data with repeated keys.
