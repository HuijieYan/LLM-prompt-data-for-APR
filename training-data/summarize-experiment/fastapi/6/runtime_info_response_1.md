The buggy function, `request_body_to_args`, is designed to validate and process request body data against a list of required parameter fields. It consumes a list of `required_params` and `received_body`, which are used to construct `values` and `errors`.

Looking at the logs from the buggy cases:

In Buggy Case 1:
- It is observed that the `required_params` is of type list containing a single ModelField 'items' with type list and is marked as required.
- The `received_body` is a FormData containing multiple entries with the key 'items'.
- The value of `values` at the end contains a key 'items' with a list of items.
- The value of `errors` is an empty list.

In Buggy Case 2:
- The `required_params` is similar to Buggy Case 1 but with the type of 'items' being set instead of list.
- The `received_body` is also a FormData.
- The value of `values` contains a key 'items' with a set of items.
- The value of `errors` is an empty list.

In Buggy Case 3:
- Similar to Buggy Case 1, the `required_params` is a list with a single ModelField 'items' with type tuple.
- The `received_body` is a FormData.
- The value of `values` contains a key 'items' with a tuple of items.
- The value of `errors` is an empty list.

Analyzing the function:
- The function first initializes `values` as an empty dictionary and `errors` as an empty list.
- It then checks if `required_params` is not empty. If it's not, it proceeds to process each field one by one.
- For each field, it extracts the field information and checks if the `received_body` is not None.
- Based on the shape of the field, it extracts values from the `received_body`.
- It then proceeds with further validations and awaits reading/uploading of file data if a file type and updates `values` and `errors` accordingly.

Potential Issues:
- In all buggy cases, the code correctly processes the `received_body` and populates the `values` dictionary based on the content. Therefore, the bug might reside in the part before field validation or the validation itself.
- The usage of `deepcopy` for setting default values in the dictionary and processing of failure cases through errors is ensuring the integrity of the results for `values` and track of errors in `errors`.

To identify the root cause of the failure in the test cases (Buggy Case 1, Buggy Case 2, and Buggy Case 3), a detailed review of the field validation logic is required. Additionally, examining the implementation of the `ModelField` and `get_field_info` would add to understanding how the checks and validations are being handled.

Further analysis is required to identify the specific bugs in the function that are causing test cases to fail. Additional information about the `ModelField` and `get_field_info` will aid in the thorough investigation of this issue.
