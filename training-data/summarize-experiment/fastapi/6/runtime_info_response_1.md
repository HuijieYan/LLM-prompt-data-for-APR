After analyzing the provided information, it appears that the `request_body_to_args` function is intended to map fields from a received body to arguments. The function processes the received data based on the required parameters and returns a dictionary of values along with any potential errors.

Let's start by examining each of the buggy cases in detail to understand the behavior and potential issues in the `request_body_to_args` function.

### Buggy Case 1

In this test case, the required parameter is a list containing a single ModelField with the name 'items' and type 'list'. The received body is of type FormData and contains multiple values for the 'items' field. The `received_body.getlist` and `received_body.get` methods are present.

The variables at the time of return are as follows:
- `values` is a dictionary with the 'items' key mapped to a list `['first', 'second', 'third']`.
- `errors` is an empty list.
- The `field` variable is a ModelField instance with the name 'items', type 'list', and is required.
- The `field_info` is a Form instance with the attribute `embed` set to `True`.
- The `embed` variable is a boolean set to `True`.
- The `value` variable contains the list `['first', 'second', 'third']`.
- The `field.validate` method is present.

Based on this case, the function seems to handle the 'list' type correctly by mapping the received body values to a list of items under the 'items' key in the `values` dictionary.

### Buggy Case 2

In this test case, the required parameter is a list containing a single ModelField with the name 'items' and type 'set'. The received body is similar to the previous case and is of type FormData.

The variables at the time of return are as follows:
- `values` is a dictionary with the 'items' key mapped to a set containing `{'first', 'second', 'third'}`.
- `errors` is an empty list.
- The variables for `field`, `field_info`, `embed`, `value`, and `field.validate` are the same as in the previous case.

This case suggests that the function is correctly mapping the received body values to a set of items under the 'items' key in the `values` dictionary, indicating no issues with processing the 'set' type.

### Buggy Case 3

In this test case, the required parameter is a list containing a single ModelField with the name 'items' and type 'tuple'. The received body is of type FormData, similar to the previous cases.

The variables at the time of return are as follows:
- `values` is a dictionary with the 'items' key mapped to a tuple `('first', 'second', 'third')`.
- `errors` is an empty list.
- The variables for `field`, `field_info`, `embed`, `value`, and `field.validate` are the same as in the previous cases.

This case depicts the function correctly mapping the received body values to a tuple of items under the 'items' key in the `values` dictionary, indicating no issues with processing the 'tuple' type.

### Insights from Analysis

Based on the analysis of the buggy cases, the function appears to handle and set the values correctly for different types (list, set, tuple) based on the received body. It constructs the `values` dictionary and populates it efficiently based on the field types and required parameters. The `errors` list remains empty, indicating successful processing without any errors.

Given the provided runtime values and types inside the function, no evident programming error or discrepancy is observed. Therefore, it can be inferred that the issues causing the failed test cases might not be directly attributed to the `request_body_to_args` function.

To identify the root cause of the test case failures, further investigation on the failed test cases, input data, and expected behavior might be required. Additionally, reviewing any error logs or discrepancies in the test cases could provide additional insights into potential issues related to the function's usage or test case setup.
