In this buggy function, `request_body_to_args`, variables `required_params` and `received_body` are used as input parameters. Additionally, variables `values` and `errors` are initialized as an empty dictionary and an empty list, respectively.

In the first test case, `required_params` is a list containing one element of type `ModelField` with the name 'items', type 'list', and it's required. `received_body` is of type `FormData` with the values ('items', 'first'), ('items', 'second'), and ('items', 'third'). When the buggy function returns, the `values` dictionary is populated with the `'items'` key containing a list `['first', 'second', 'third']`, and `errors` remains an empty list.

In the second test case, we observe the same `required_params` and `received_body` values as in case 1. When the buggy function returns, the `values` dictionary is populated with the `'items'` key containing a set `{'third', 'second', 'first'}`, and `errors` remains an empty list.

In the third test case, `required_params` is a list containing one element of type `ModelField` with the name 'items', type 'tuple', and it's required. `received_body` is of type `FormData` with the values ('items', 'first'), ('items', 'second'), and ('items', 'third'). When the buggy function returns, the `values` dictionary is populated with the `'items'` key containing a tuple `('first', 'second', 'third')`, and `errors` remains an empty list.

Upon analyzing the buggy function and the variables associated with it, it seems that the issue arises from the logic used to process the `received_body` and populate the `values` and `errors`. Further debugging and code exploration are necessary to identify and fix the bug.
