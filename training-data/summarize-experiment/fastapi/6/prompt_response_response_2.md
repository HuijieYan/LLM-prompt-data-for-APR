The bug in the function `request_body_to_args` is likely related to the handling of repeated keys in form data. In the test function `test_python_tuple_param_as_form`, the bug causes the assertion `response.status_code == 200` to fail, as the response code is actually 422. This discrepancy indicates that the function is not correctly validating and processing the form data with repeated keys, leading to an incorrect response status code.

Upon inspection of the function, it seems that the bug may be occurring due to the way the function processes form data with repeated keys. The current logic may not properly handle and validate the repeated keys, leading to unexpected behavior and incorrect validation outcomes.

To address this issue, the function should be updated to properly handle form data with repeated keys. This may involve modifying the logic for processing form data and ensuring that repeated keys are correctly collected and validated as lists before the validation step.

Additionally, it seems that the function should account for the specific types such as set, list, and tuple when processing the form data inputs for these types.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function that addresses the bug:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape == "list" and field.alias in received_body:
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    values[field.alias] = value
                elif field.shape == "set" and field.alias in received_body:
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                    values[field.alias] = set(value)
                elif field.shape == "tuple" and field.alias in received_body:
                    value = tuple(received_body.getlist(field.alias))
                    values[field.alias] = value
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
                    values[field.alias] = value

                if value is None:
                    if field.required:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:
                        values[field.alias] = deepcopy(field.default)
                        continue

                field_info = get_field_info(field)

                if (
                    isinstance(field_info, params.File)
                    and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes)
                    and isinstance(value, UploadFile)
                ):
                    value = await value.read()
                    values[field.alias] = value

                v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                    errors.append(errors_)
                elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                    errors.extend(errors_)
                else:
                    values[field.alias] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version of the function, the processing of the `received_body` has been updated to properly handle form data with repeated keys for types like list, set, and tuple. The values are collected and stored in the `values` dictionary as appropriate lists, sets, or tuples based on the field shapes.

This updated logic should address the bug related to processing form data with repeated keys and ensure that the function correctly populates the `values` and `errors` based on the input parameters and received body.

Additionally, the function now accounts for specific types such as set, list, and tuple when processing the form data inputs, ensuring that form data with repeated keys is correctly handled and validated.
