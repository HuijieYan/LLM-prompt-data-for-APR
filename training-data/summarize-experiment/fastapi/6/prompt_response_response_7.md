Based on the provided analysis and information, it appears that the issue causing the test case failures is related to the handling of repeated key=value pairs in form data. This results in only the last key=value winning, which restricts the ability to validate against all values.

The suggested approach to fix this bug involves enhancing the data aggregation and validation process within the `request_body_to_args` function. Specifically, the function should gather repeated keys in a 2-tuple list and assign those values as a list to the same key before the validation process occurs. This would enable more comprehensive and accurate validation against all the provided values.

To address this bug, the proposed approach is to modify the logic for retrieving values from the form data and handling repeated keys. Additionally, the validation process needs to be updated to support the new data aggregation approach. By implementing these changes, the function will be able to accurately process repeated key=value pairs and perform comprehensive validation against all values.

Here is the corrected and enhanced version of the `request_body_to_args` function that addresses the bug and incorporates the suggested approach:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []
    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            values[field.name] = []
            if received_body is not None:
                # Retrieve all values for the field regardless of repeated keys
                if isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    values[field.name] = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    values[field.name].append(received_body.get(field.alias))

            # Perform validation on all retrieved values
            for value in values[field.name]:
                if value is None or value == "":
                    if field.required:
                        if PYDANTIC_1:
                            errors.append(
                                ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                            )
                        else:
                            errors.append(
                                ErrorWrapper(
                                    MissingError(),
                                    loc=("body", field.alias),
                                    config=BaseConfig,
                                )
                            )
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                else:
                    v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                    if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                        errors.append(errors_)
                    elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                        errors.extend(errors_)
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = v_
    return values, errors
```

In this corrected version, the function loops through each `required_param` to gather all values for the field, regardless of repeated keys in the form data. The gathered values are stored in a list within the `values` dictionary for the corresponding field. Subsequently, the function performs validation on all retrieved values for each field, ensuring comprehensive validation against all provided values.

By implementing these changes, the function now effectively handles repeated key=value pairs in form data and supports more comprehensive validation, aligning with the proposed solution to address the bug. This corrected version can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.
