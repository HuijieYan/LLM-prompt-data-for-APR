The test case that is failing is `test_python_tuple_param_as_form`, which expects the response status code to be 200 but instead receives a status code of 422. This indicates that the function `request_body_to_args` is not processing the input parameters and received body correctly, leading to incorrect validation and response.

The potential error location within the `request_body_to_args` function seems to be related to handling the received_body for sequence-shaped fields. It appears that the logic for processing and validating the received_body for sequence-shaped fields, such as list and tuple, is not functioning as expected, leading to validation errors and incorrect output.

The bug is likely occurring due to improper handling of repeated key=value pairs in the received form data. The issue is exacerbated by the fact that the function is not correctly processing repeated keys to validate against all values, leading to validation errors and incorrect responses.

To fix the bug, the `request_body_to_args` function needs to be updated to properly handle repeated key=value pairs in form data. The function should collect repeated keys and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation happens. This will ensure that all values associated with repeated keys are properly processed and validated.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_body_to_args` function:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)

            if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == "") or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and field.shape in sequence_shapes and len(value) == 0):
                if field.required:
                    if PYDANTIC_1:
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                        )
                    else:  # pragma: nocover
                        errors.append(
                            ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                MissingError(),
                                loc=("body", field.alias),
                                config=BaseConfig,
                            )
                        )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
                continue
            
            # For sequence-shaped fields, ensure values are processed as a list
            if field.shape in sequence_shapes:
                if not isinstance(value, list):
                    value = [value]

            if isinstance(field_info, params.File) and lenient_issubclass(field.type_, bytes):
                if isinstance(value, list):
                    value = [await v.read() for v in value]
                else:
                    value = await value.read()

            v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

This revised function includes logic to handle sequence-shaped fields and repeated key=value pairs in form data. It ensures that all values associated with repeated keys are processed as a list before validation happens. This will address the bug and ensure that the function properly processes the input parameters and received body to generate the correct output.
