The test cases in `tests/test_forms_from_non_typing_sequences.py` are testing the functionality of sending form data with repeated keys like `items` as a list, set, or tuple and validating the received data. The error message indicates that the expected response status code is 200, but the actual status code is 422.

The potential error location within the `request_body_to_args` function is likely the section where it processes the `received_body` and populates the `values` dictionary based on the content. Given the test cases and error message, it's possible that the function is not correctly handling form data with repeated keys, leading to validation issues and the unexpected status code.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle repeated keys properly in form data. When processing the form data with repeated keys, such as in the test cases, the function should collect repeated keys and assign those values as a list for the same key before validation takes place. Currently, the function does not handle this scenario correctly, leading to validation failures and the unexpected status code.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to collect repeated keys in the form data and assign those values as a list to the same key before validation. This will ensure that the form data with repeated keys is processed and validated correctly.

Here is the corrected version of the `request_body_to_args` function that resolves the bug:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    # Initialize values and errors
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(
                    received_body, FormData
                ):
                    # Get a list of values if the field shape is a sequence and form data is received
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)
                else:
                    # Get the value from the form data based on the field alias
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias, None)

                if value is not None:
                    # Handle repeated keys by ensuring the value is always a list
                    if not isinstance(value, list):
                        value = [value]

                    # Store the validated value in the values dictionary
                    v_, errors_ = field.validate(value, values, loc=("body", field.alias))
                    if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                        errors.append(errors_)
                    elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                        errors.extend(errors_)
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = v_
                else:
                    # If the value is None, handle it based on the field's attributes
                    if field.required:
                        if PYDANTIC_1:
                            errors.append(
                                ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                            )
                        else:  # pragma: nocover
                            errors.append(
                                ErrorWrapper(  # type: ignore
                                    MissingError(),
                                    loc=("body", field.alias),
                                    config=BaseConfig,
                                )
                            )
                    else:
                        values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)

    return values, errors
```

In the corrected version, the function now handles repeated keys in the form data by ensuring that the values are always processed as lists before validation takes place. This resolves the bug and ensures that form data with repeated keys is processed and validated correctly, addressing the issues encountered in the test cases.
