The issue in the provided function `request_body_to_args` is related to the handling of repeated key=value pairs in form data. This results in only the last key=value winning, which limits the ability to validate against all values. The bug is evident in the incorrect handling of repeated keys, leading to inadequate validation capabilities.

To address this issue, the function should be updated to gather repeated keys in a 2-tuple list and assign those values as a list to the same key before the validation process occurs. This approach will enable more comprehensive and accurate validation against all the provided values, aligning with the expected functionality.

The corrected code for the `request_body_to_args` function is provided below:

```python
async def request_body_to_args(
    required_params: List[ModelField],
    received_body: Optional[Union[Dict[str, Any], FormData]],
) -> Tuple[Dict[str, Any], List[ErrorWrapper]]:
    values = {}
    errors = []

    if required_params:
        for field in required_params:
            value: Any = None
            if received_body is not None:
                if field.shape in sequence_shapes and isinstance(received_body, FormData):
                    value = received_body.getlist(field.alias)  # Gather repeated keys as a list
                else:
                    value = received_body.get(field.alias)
            
            if value is None or (isinstance(field_info, params.Form) and value == ""):
                if field.required:
                    errors.append(
                        ErrorWrapper(MissingError(), loc=("body", field.alias))
                    )
                else:
                    values[field.name] = deepcopy(field.default)
            else:
                values[field.name] = value  # Assign values to the corresponding field name in values

    # Perform the validation of values and gather any errors
    for field in required_params:
        if field.name in values:
            v_, errors_ = field.validate(values[field.name], values, loc=("body", field.alias))
            if isinstance(errors_, ErrorWrapper):
                errors.append(errors_)
            elif isinstance(errors_, list):
                errors.extend(errors_)
            else:  # If no errors, assign the validated value to the field name
                values[field.name] = v_

    return values, errors
```

In the corrected code:
- The function now correctly gathers repeated keys as a list when `field.shape` is in `sequence_shapes` and `received_body` is an instance of `FormData`.
- The values are assigned to the corresponding field name in the `values` dictionary, ensuring all values are accounted for during the validation process.
- Validation of the values is performed, and any errors are appropriately collected in the `errors` list.

This corrected version of the function addresses the bug related to the handling of repeated key=value pairs in form data, allowing for more accurate validation against all provided values.
