Based on the provided logs, it's evident that the `request_httprepr` function is meant to return the raw HTTP representation of a given request. In the first buggy case, the input request is `GET file:///tmp/foo.txt`, which has a method of `'GET'`, empty headers, and an empty body. 

Inside the function, the `parsed` variable is derived from the input request using the `urlparse_cached` function. The `path` variable is then obtained from the `parsed` result, and in this case, it is set to `'/tmp/foo.txt'`.

During the creation of the `s` variable, the `method`, `path`, and the HTTP version are concatenated together to form the initial part of the HTTP request. The `Host` header is added, which is expected to be filled with the parsed hostname from the request. However, this part of the code seems to have a bug since the `parsed.hostname` value is missing in the output. This results in the `Host` header being incomplete or incorrect in the returned raw HTTP representation.

In the second buggy case, a similar pattern is observed. The input request is `GET ftp://localhost/tmp/foo.txt`, with the same method, empty headers, and an empty body. The `parsed` variable is derived from the input request using the `urlparse_cached` function. The `path` variable is then obtained from the `parsed` result, and in this case, it is also set to `'/tmp/foo.txt'`.

During the creation of the `s` variable, the `method`, `path`, and the HTTP version are concatenated together to form the initial part of the HTTP request. The `Host` header is added, completing the request with the appropriate hostname from the parsed result, which is `localhost`.

In summary, it seems the bug in the `request_httprepr` function is related to the inadequate handling of the Host header when assembling the raw HTTP representation of the request. The `parsed.hostname` value is missing when adding the `Host` header, leading to incomplete or incorrect raw HTTP representations in the returned output. This would explain the failed test cases.
