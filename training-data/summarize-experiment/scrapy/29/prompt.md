Please correct the malfunctioning function provided below by using the relevant information listed to address this bug. Then, produce a revised version of the function that resolves the issue. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
from six.moves.urllib.parse import urlunparse
from scrapy.utils.python import to_bytes, to_native_str
from scrapy.utils.httpobj import urlparse_cached
```

The following is the buggy function that you need to fix:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s

```



## Test Functions and Error Messages Summary
The followings are test functions under directory `tests/test_utils_request.py` in the project.
```python
def test_request_httprepr_for_non_http_request(self):
    # the representation is not important but it must not fail.
    request_httprepr(Request("file:///tmp/foo.txt"))
    request_httprepr(Request("ftp://localhost/tmp/foo.txt"))
```

Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:
The error occurs in the `request_httprepr` function when it attempts to concatenate the 'Host' string with the parsed hostname. The error message points to the `to_bytes` function, indicating that it is receiving a `NoneType` object when it expects a unicode, string, or bytes object.

Looking at the test function `test_request_httprepr_for_non_http_request`, it is evident that the intention of the test is to ensure that the function `request_httprepr` does not fail for non-HTTP requests, as the representation is not important. The test invokes the `request_httprepr` function with a file and an FTP request.

The error message indicates that when the `request_httprepr` function processes the given request, it encounters a `None` value for the `parsed.hostname` while attempting to convert it using the `to_bytes` function. This causes the `to_bytes` function to raise a `TypeError` as it expects a unicode, string, or bytes object but receives a `NoneType`.

To diagnose and resolve the error, it is important to inspect the `urlparse_cached` function that parses the request. This function should handle different types of requests and its return value should be verified to ensure that it does not return `None` for important components such as the hostname.

Additionally, the implementation of the `to_bytes` function should be examined to understand how it handles different input types and whether it can accommodate a `None` value gracefully or whether it needs to be modified to handle this case. Further investigation is required to address these issues and ensure that the `request_httprepr` function can handle non-HTTP requests without encountering errors.



## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

Based on the provided logs, it's evident that the `request_httprepr` function is meant to return the raw HTTP representation of a given request. In the first buggy case, the input request is `GET file:///tmp/foo.txt`, which has a method of `'GET'`, empty headers, and an empty body. 

Inside the function, the `parsed` variable is derived from the input request using the `urlparse_cached` function. The `path` variable is then obtained from the `parsed` result, and in this case, it is set to `'/tmp/foo.txt'`.

During the creation of the `s` variable, the `method`, `path`, and the HTTP version are concatenated together to form the initial part of the HTTP request. The `Host` header is added, which is expected to be filled with the parsed hostname from the request. However, this part of the code seems to have a bug since the `parsed.hostname` value is missing in the output. This results in the `Host` header being incomplete or incorrect in the returned raw HTTP representation.

In the second buggy case, a similar pattern is observed. The input request is `GET ftp://localhost/tmp/foo.txt`, with the same method, empty headers, and an empty body. The `parsed` variable is derived from the input request using the `urlparse_cached` function. The `path` variable is then obtained from the `parsed` result, and in this case, it is also set to `'/tmp/foo.txt'`.

During the creation of the `s` variable, the `method`, `path`, and the HTTP version are concatenated together to form the initial part of the HTTP request. The `Host` header is added, completing the request with the appropriate hostname from the parsed result, which is `localhost`.

In summary, it seems the bug in the `request_httprepr` function is related to the inadequate handling of the Host header when assembling the raw HTTP representation of the request. The `parsed.hostname` value is missing when adding the `Host` header, leading to incomplete or incorrect raw HTTP representations in the returned output. This would explain the failed test cases.
