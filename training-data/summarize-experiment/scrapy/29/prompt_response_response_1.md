The error occurs when the function `request_httprepr` tries to concatenate the `parsed.hostname` with the `b"Host: "` using the `to_bytes` function. The error message states that it received a `NoneType` instead of the expected data types, which means `parsed.hostname` is resolving to `None`.

The bug is occurring because the `parsed` object obtained from `urlparse_cached(request)` is not guaranteed to have a `hostname` attribute. This can happen if the URL does not contain a hostname.

To fix this, we need to check if `parsed.hostname` is not None before using it in the concatenation.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:  # Check if parsed.hostname is not None
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
``` 

With this fixed function, the `parsed.hostname` will be concatenated only if it is not None, which resolves the issue and prevents the `NoneType` error from occurring.
