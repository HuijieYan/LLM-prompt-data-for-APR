The error occurs in the `request_httprepr` function when it attempts to concatenate the 'Host' string with the parsed hostname. The error message points to the `to_bytes` function, indicating that it is receiving a `NoneType` object when it expects a unicode, string, or bytes object.

Looking at the test function `test_request_httprepr_for_non_http_request`, it is evident that the intention of the test is to ensure that the function `request_httprepr` does not fail for non-HTTP requests, as the representation is not important. The test invokes the `request_httprepr` function with a file and an FTP request.

The error message indicates that when the `request_httprepr` function processes the given request, it encounters a `None` value for the `parsed.hostname` while attempting to convert it using the `to_bytes` function. This causes the `to_bytes` function to raise a `TypeError` as it expects a unicode, string, or bytes object but receives a `NoneType`.

To diagnose and resolve the error, it is important to inspect the `urlparse_cached` function that parses the request. This function should handle different types of requests and its return value should be verified to ensure that it does not return `None` for important components such as the hostname.

Additionally, the implementation of the `to_bytes` function should be examined to understand how it handles different input types and whether it can accommodate a `None` value gracefully or whether it needs to be modified to handle this case. Further investigation is required to address these issues and ensure that the `request_httprepr` function can handle non-HTTP requests without encountering errors.
