The error occurs when the `to_bytes` function is called with the `parsed.hostname` variable, which is `None` in the case of `file://` URLs. This triggers a `TypeError` because the `to_bytes` function cannot handle a `None` type.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the parsed URL scheme is not HTTP or HTTPS. We can modify the `request_httprepr` function to check if the parsed `scheme` is `http` or `https` before constructing the raw HTTP representation. If the scheme is not `http` or `https`, we can set the `host` to the `netloc` of the parsed URL.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    if parsed.scheme in ['http', 'https']:
        path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
        host = parsed.hostname
    else:
        path = parsed.path or '/'
        host = parsed.netloc
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(host) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

This revised function first checks if the scheme is `http` or `https` and constructs the `path` and `host` variables accordingly. If the scheme is not `http` or `https`, it sets the `path` to the parsed path or '/' and the `host` to the parsed netloc.

By adding this conditional check, we can ensure that the `parsed.hostname` is only used when the scheme is `http` or `https`, thus resolving the issue.
