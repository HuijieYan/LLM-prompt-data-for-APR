The error occurs at the line `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"` in the `request_httprepr` function. This is because `parsed.hostname` can be `None` when using non-HTTP schemes like `file` or `ftp`. The `to_bytes` function doesn't allow a `None` type as input, which results in a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, we need to update the code to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None`. We can use the `netloc` attribute of the `parsed` object as the host when `parsed.hostname` is `None`.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    host = parsed.hostname if parsed.hostname else parsed.netloc  # Use netloc if hostname is None
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(host) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this correction, the `parsed.netloc` is used as the host when `parsed.hostname` is `None`. This will avoid the `TypeError` caused by passing a `None` type to the `to_bytes` function.
