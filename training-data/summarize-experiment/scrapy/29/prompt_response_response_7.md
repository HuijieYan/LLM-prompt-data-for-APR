Based on the error message and the test case, it is evident that the `request_httprepr` function encounters a `None` value for the `parsed.hostname` attribute when processing non-HTTP requests. This causes the `to_bytes` function to raise a `TypeError` as it expects a unicode, string, or bytes object but receives a `NoneType`.

The potential error location is in the line `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"` where the `parsed.hostname` is expected to have a valid value but it is sometimes `None` for non-HTTP requests.

The reason behind the bug is that the function does not handle non-HTTP requests correctly. It assumes that the `parsed` result always contains a valid hostname, which is not the case for non-HTTP requests.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to handle non-HTTP requests gracefully by checking for the presence of a hostname in the parsed result before using it to construct the raw HTTP representation. If the hostname is not present, a default value or an empty string can be used to ensure that the `to_bytes` function does not encounter a `NoneType` object.

Here is the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    # Add Host header only if the parsed hostname exists
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected code, a conditional check is added to verify the presence of a hostname in the parsed result before adding the `Host` header to the raw HTTP representation. If the hostname exists, it is added to the `s` variable; otherwise, it is skipped to avoid encountering a `NoneType` object. This modification ensures that the function can handle non-HTTP requests without encountering errors.
