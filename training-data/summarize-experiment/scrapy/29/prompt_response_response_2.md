The Error is caused by the `to_bytes(parsed.hostname)` statement which is trying to convert the `None` type to bytes. This is happening when the input URL starts with `file://`, `ftp://`, or other non-HTTP protocols. 

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `request_httprepr` function to handle non-HTTP protocols by checking if the parsed URL has a hostname before trying to convert it to bytes.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    
    if parsed.hostname:  # Check if the parsed URL has a hostname 
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this fix, we first check if the parsed URL has a hostname before trying to concatenate it to the output byte string. If the parsed URL has a hostname, then we proceed to add it to the byte string. Otherwise, we skip adding the 'Host' header, which is appropriate for non-HTTP protocols.

This corrected function will now handle non-HTTP protocols gracefully and should not raise any exceptions as shown in the test function error message.
