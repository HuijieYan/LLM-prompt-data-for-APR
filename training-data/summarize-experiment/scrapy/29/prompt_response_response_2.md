The error occurs because the `parsed.hostname` inside the `s` variable is causing the `to_bytes` function to raise a `TypeError` when it receives a `NoneType` value. This means that the `parsed.hostname` is evaluating to `None`, which shouldn't be the case.

To fix this issue, we need to handle the scenario where `parsed.hostname` is `None`. We can provide a default value for `parsed.hostname` in case it's `None` to prevent the `TypeError` from being raised.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    host = to_bytes(parsed.hostname) if parsed.hostname else b'localhost'  # Providing a default value for parsed.hostname
    s += b"Host: " + host + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected version, we added a check for `parsed.hostname` to provide a default value of `b'localhost'` in case it's `None`. This will prevent the `TypeError` from being raised and resolve the issue.
