Based on the error message and the provided test case, it is evident that the bug occurs when the `parsed.hostname` value is missing while constructing the `Host` header in the `request_httprepr` function. This leads to a `None` value being passed to the `to_bytes` function, causing a `TypeError` due to its inability to handle `None` inputs.

The potential error location is within the section of code where the `Host` header is added to the raw HTTP representation:
```python
s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
```

The absence of proper handling for the hostname parsed from the request causes the `to_bytes` function to encounter a `None` value, resulting in a `TypeError`.

To resolve this bug, the `request_httprepr` function needs to be modified to handle cases where the `parsed.hostname` value may be missing. This can be achieved by checking if `parsed.hostname` exists before concatenating it with the `Host` header. If it is missing, a default value or a placeholder can be used to ensure that the `to_bytes` function does not receive a `None` value.

Here is the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    
    host_header = b""
    if parsed.hostname:
        host_header = b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    else:
        # Use a default value or raise an error as applicable
        host_header = b"Host: DEFAULT_HOST\r\n"  # Replace with appropriate default value
    
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += host_header
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected code, a conditional check has been added to ensure that the `parsed.hostname` value exists before adding it to the `Host` header. If it is missing, a default value or appropriate error handling can be implemented to avoid passing a `None` value to the `to_bytes` function. This modification resolves the bug and ensures that the `request_httprepr` function can handle non-HTTP requests without encountering errors.
