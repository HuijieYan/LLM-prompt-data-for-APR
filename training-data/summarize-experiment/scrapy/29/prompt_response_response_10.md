The bug in the `request_httprepr` function is related to the inadequate handling of the Host header when assembling the raw HTTP representation of the request. The `parsed.hostname` value is missing when adding the Host header, leading to incomplete or incorrect raw HTTP representations in the returned output. This explains the `NoneType` error encountered when attempting to process non-HTTP requests.

To resolve this bug, the `parsed.hostname` value should be properly handled to ensure that it is included in the Host header when creating the raw HTTP representation of the request.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    hostname = parsed.hostname if parsed.hostname else b'localhost'
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body if request.body else b""
    return s
```

In this corrected version, the `hostname` variable ensures that a default value of b'localhost' is used if the `parsed.hostname` value is missing or empty. This ensures that the Host header is properly assembled with a valid hostname, addressing the bug and allowing the function to handle non-HTTP requests without encountering errors.
