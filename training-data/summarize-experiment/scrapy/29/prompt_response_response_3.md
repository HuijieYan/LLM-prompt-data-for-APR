Based on the provided test case and error message, it is evident that the bug occurs in the `request_httprepr` function when it attempts to concatenate the 'Host' string with the parsed hostname. The error message points to the `to_bytes` function, indicating that it is receiving a `NoneType` object when it expects a unicode, string, or bytes object.

The bug is occurring because the `parsed.hostname` value is missing when adding the `Host` header, leading to incomplete or incorrect raw HTTP representations in the returned output.

To address this bug, the `parsed` variable should be properly checked to ensure that it contains the expected components such as the hostname, and handle the case where the hostname may be missing. Additionally, the code that constructs the raw HTTP representation should handle the absence of the hostname gracefully, ensuring that the `Host` header is complete and accurate.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
