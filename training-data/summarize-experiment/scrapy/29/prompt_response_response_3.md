The error message indicates a `TypeError` within the `to_bytes` function, specifically with the `parsed.hostname` attribute. This suggests that `parsed.hostname` is evaluated to `None`, causing the `to_bytes` function to fail.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"`. The `parsed.hostname` attribute might be evaluated as `None`, which causes the `to_bytes` function to raise a `TypeError`.

The bug occurs because the `parsed.hostname` attribute is not present in the `urlparse_cached` function's output when the input URL does not contain a hostname. This causes the `to_bytes` function to receive a `None` value, resulting in a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `parsed.hostname` attribute is not `None` before using it. We can achieve this by using a conditional check to include the `Host` header only when `parsed.hostname` is not `None`.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:  # Check if hostname is present
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

This corrected code includes a conditional check to ensure that the `Host` header is only added when the `parsed.hostname` attribute is not `None`. This resolves the issue of the `TypeError` when `parsed.hostname` is `None`. The corrected code can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.
