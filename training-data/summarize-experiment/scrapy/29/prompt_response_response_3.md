The error occurs in the `request_httprepr` function when it tries to convert the `parsed.hostname` to bytes using the `to_bytes` function. Since the `parsed.hostname` may be `None` in certain cases for non-HTTP requests, the `to_bytes` function throws a `TypeError` when trying to convert `None` to bytes.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` before converting it to bytes.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    host = to_bytes(parsed.hostname) if parsed.hostname else b''
    s += b"Host: " + host + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this fix, we check if `parsed.hostname` is `None` before trying to convert it to bytes, and only convert it to bytes if it's not `None`. This prevents the `TypeError` from occurring and resolves the bug.

The fix also ensures that the corrected function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
