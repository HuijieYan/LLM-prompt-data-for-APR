The error message indicates a `TypeError` in the `to_bytes` function due to a `NoneType` object being passed to it. This is most likely happening when `parsed.hostname` is `None`. This can occur when the URL doesn't contain a hostname, such as with the "file" or "ftp" schemes.

To fix this, we can modify the code to handle the case when `parsed.hostname` is `None`, and provide a default value for the hostname in those cases. We can also update the `path` generation logic to handle cases where `parsed.path` is empty.

Here's the revised version of the function that resolves the issue:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    
    hostname = to_bytes(parsed.hostname) if parsed.hostname else b"localhost"
    
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + hostname + b"\r\n"
    
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With these changes, we handle the case when `parsed.hostname` is `None` by providing a default value of `b"localhost"`. We also update the logic for generating the `path` to handle cases where `parsed.path` is empty. These changes ensure that the function performs correctly in all scenarios.
