Based on the provided information, the potential error location within the `request_httprepr` function is identified as the concatenation of the `Host` header with the parsed hostname. This results in incomplete or incorrect HTTP representations in the returned output.

The error occurs because the `parsed.hostname` value is missing when adding the `Host` header, causing the `to_bytes` function to receive a `None` value instead of a valid hostname. This leads to a `TypeError` as the `to_bytes` function expects a unicode, string, or bytes object.

To fix the bug, the `Host` header should be constructed properly using the parsed hostname from the request. Additionally, the implementation of the `urlparse_cached` function should be verified to ensure it correctly handles different types of requests and does not return `None` for important components such as the hostname.

Based on these considerations, the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function is provided below:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    hostname = parsed.hostname or b""
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the corrected code, the `parsed.hostname` value is used to construct the `Host` header, with a fallback to an empty bytes object if `parsed.hostname` is `None`. This ensures that the `to_bytes` function receives a valid input and does not encounter a `TypeError`.

The corrected code addresses the issue of incomplete or incorrect HTTP representations in the original function and should resolve the bug.
