The error message indicates that the `to_bytes` function is receiving a `NoneType` instead of the expected `unicode`, `str`, or `bytes` object. This leads us to the line where `to_bytes` is being applied to `parsed.hostname`.

The bug occurs because the `parsed.hostname` extracted from the URL might be `None` in the case of non-HTTP URLs such as 'file:/' or 'ftp://'. This causes the `to_bytes` function to fail when trying to convert `None` to bytes.

To fix this bug, we can modify the code to handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` and provide a default value for the host.

Here's the revised version of the function with the bug fixed:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    host = parsed.hostname if parsed.hostname else b'localhost'  # provide a default value for the host
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(host) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

With this modified version, we handle the case where `parsed.hostname` is `None` by providing a default value 'localhost' for the host, ensuring that the `to_bytes` function has a valid input to convert to bytes. This revised function should now work correctly for non-HTTP URLs like 'file:/' or 'ftp://'.
