The error occurs in the `request_httprepr` function while trying to retrieve the `hostname` from the `parsed` object. The `parsed` object was created using the `urlparse_cached` function, and it seems that for non-HTTP requests, it does not populate the `hostname` attribute, resulting in a `None` value.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case where the `hostname` is `None` and provide a default value for it.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    if parsed.hostname:
        s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
