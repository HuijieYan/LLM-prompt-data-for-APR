Based on the provided information, the bug in the `request_httprepr` function is related to the inadequate handling of the `Host` header when assembling the raw HTTP representation of the request. The `parsed.hostname` value is missing when adding the `Host` header, leading to incomplete or incorrect raw HTTP representations in the returned output. This results in the `to_bytes` function encountering a `NoneType` object when it expects a unicode, string, or bytes object.

To fix this bug, the `parsed.hostname` value needs to be properly handled to ensure that it is included in the `Host` header. Additionally, a check should be added to ensure that the `parsed` object and its components are not `None` before accessing their values.

Here's the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    if parsed.hostname:
        host_header = b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
    else:
        host_header = b""
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += host_header
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```

In the revised function, a check for the existence of `parsed.hostname` is added to ensure that the `Host` header is only included if the hostname is present. This prevents the `to_bytes` function from encountering a `NoneType` object and resolves the issue of incomplete or incorrect raw HTTP representations in the returned output. This revised code can be used as a drop-in replacement for the original buggy version of the function.
