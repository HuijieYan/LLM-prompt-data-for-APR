The error message indicates that the `parsed.hostname` is returning a `NoneType` value, which causes the `to_bytes()` function to raise a `TypeError`. This suggests that the `hostname` attribute is not being set properly when parsing the URL.

To fix this issue, we need to use the `netloc` attribute from the parsed URL instead of `hostname`. The `netloc` attribute contains both the hostname and the port number, if available, so it will provide the correct value needed for the Host header.

Here's the corrected version of the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    netloc = parsed.netloc
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(netloc) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
