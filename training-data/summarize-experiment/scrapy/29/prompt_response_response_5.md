Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug in the `request_httprepr` function is related to the inadequate handling of the Host header when assembling the raw HTTP representation of the request. The `parsed.hostname` value is missing when adding the Host header, leading to incomplete or incorrect raw HTTP representations in the returned output. This would explain the failed test cases.

To fix the bug, the following steps can be taken:
1. Ensure that the `urlparse_cached` function returns a `parsed` object with a valid `hostname` attribute for non-HTTP requests.
2. Modify the function to handle the case when `parsed.hostname` is `None` and provide a fallback value if necessary.

Here is the corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function:

```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be sent when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    if not parsed.hostname:
        parsed_hostname = b""
    else:
        parsed_hostname = to_bytes(parsed.hostname)

    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + parsed_hostname + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body if request.body else b""
    return s
```

In the revised version, a check is added to ensure that `parsed.hostname` is not `None`. If it is `None`, an empty bytes object is assigned to `parsed_hostname`. Otherwise, the value of `parsed.hostname` is converted to bytes and assigned to `parsed_hostname`. The rest of the function remains unchanged.

With these modifications, the function should be able to handle non-HTTP requests without encountering errors.
