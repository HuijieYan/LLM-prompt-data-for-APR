The error in the `request_httprepr` function occurs when it attempts to concatenate the 'Host' string with the parsed hostname. The error message indicates that the `to_bytes` function is receiving a `NoneType` object when it expects a unicode, string, or bytes object.

The potential error location within the function is in the line that adds the 'Host' header:
```python
s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(parsed.hostname) + b"\r\n"
```
The `parsed.hostname` value may be `None`, leading to the error when it is passed to the `to_bytes` function.

The reason behind the bug is that the `parsed.hostname` value is not adequately handled, leading to a potential `None` value being passed to the `to_bytes` function.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to check if the `parsed.hostname` is `None` before converting it to bytes. If it is `None`, a default value or an empty string can be used to ensure that the `to_bytes` function does not encounter a `NoneType` object.

The corrected code for the `request_httprepr` function is as follows:
```python
def request_httprepr(request):
    """Return the raw HTTP representation (as bytes) of the given request.
    This is provided only for reference since it's not the actual stream of
    bytes that will be send when performing the request (that's controlled
    by Twisted).
    """
    parsed = urlparse_cached(request)
    path = urlunparse(('', '', parsed.path or '/', parsed.params, parsed.query, ''))
    host = parsed.hostname if parsed.hostname else b""

    s = to_bytes(request.method) + b" " + to_bytes(path) + b" HTTP/1.1\r\n"
    s += b"Host: " + to_bytes(host) + b"\r\n"
    if request.headers:
        s += request.headers.to_string() + b"\r\n"
    s += b"\r\n"
    s += request.body
    return s
```
In the corrected code, the `parsed.hostname` value is checked before converting it to bytes. If it is `None`, an empty string is used as the `host` value, ensuring that the `to_bytes` function does not encounter a `NoneType` object. This resolves the bug and allows the function to handle non-HTTP requests without encountering errors.
