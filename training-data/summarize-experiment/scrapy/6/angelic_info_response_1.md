Based on the analysis of the function code and the expected input and output values, the core logic of the function can be summarized as follows:

1. The function takes in an image and an optional size parameter.
2. It first checks if the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'. If so, it creates a new background image with RGBA mode and pastes the original image onto the background. It then converts the image to RGB mode.
3. If the image mode is not RGB, it converts the image to RGB mode.
4. If a size parameter is provided, it creates a copy of the image and resizes it to the specified size using the thumbnail method.
5. Finally, it saves the modified image to a buffer in JPEG format and returns the modified image along with the buffer.

The function also involves operations such as pasting the original image onto a background, converting image modes, creating copies of images, and saving images to a buffer in JPEG format.

The bug in the function may stem from the fact that the background image is created unconditionally, even if the format and mode conditions are not met. Additionally, the mode check is based on the 'PNG' format only, ignoring other formats. The function also lacks error handling for incompatible image formats and modes.
