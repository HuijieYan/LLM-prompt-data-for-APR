The function `convert_image` takes in `image` as the main parameter with an optional `size` parameter and returns the transformed image and a buffer object. The function first checks if the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA. If so, it creates a new image with a white background and pastes the input image onto the new background. Then it converts the image to RGB.

Next, it checks if the image mode is not RGB, and if so, it converts it to RGB. If the `size` parameter is specified, it creates a copy of the image, resizes it to the specified size, and then saves it as a JPEG image to a buffer.

The function returns the transformed image and the buffer. The unit tests have detailed information on the expected input and output values for different cases, allowing us to understand the core logic in different scenarios.
