Based on the provided information, the `convert_image` function checks the format and mode of the input `image`. If the format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', it creates a new image called `background` with an 'RGBA' format and pastes the original image on it. Then, it converts the `background` to 'RGB' format. If the mode is not 'RGB', the original image is converted to 'RGB' format. Additionally, if a `size` is provided, the function creates a copy of the original image and resizes it to the specified dimensions using `ANTIALIAS` as the resampling filter. Finally, the function saves the modified image as a JPEG image and returns the modified image along with a BytesIO buffer containing the image data.

Considering the expected input and output variable values, it is clear that the `convert_image` function checks the format and mode of the input image and performs the relevant transformations to ensure that the image is in 'RGB' format. If a `size` is provided, the function creates a resized copy of the original image. After processing the input image, the function saves and returns the modified image along with a BytesIO buffer.

It's also worth noting that the function seems to handle different image types, making sure that the final output is always in 'RGB' format.
