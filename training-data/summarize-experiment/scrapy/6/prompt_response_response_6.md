Based on the test case and error message, it can be inferred that the bug is occurring in the conditional block that handles PNG images with RGBA mode. The bug is likely due to the incorrect conversion from RGBA to RGB for PNG images, leading to unexpected color changes in the converted image.

To fix the bug, the conditional block handling PNG images with RGBA mode needs to be updated to correctly convert the image to RGB while preserving the transparency. Additionally, the code should handle different image formats and modes appropriately and ensure that the conversion process is accurate.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a new RGBA image with a white background
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        # Paste the original image onto the white background
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        # Convert the image to RGB while preserving transparency
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        # Convert the image to RGB if the mode is not RGB
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        # Create a copy of the image and resize it to fit within the specified size
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    # Save the modified image to a buffer in JPEG format
    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected function, the conditional block for PNG images with RGBA mode has been updated to create a new RGBA image with a white background, paste the original image onto it, and then convert it to RGB while preserving transparency. The code also includes appropriate checks for different image formats and modes, ensuring that the conversion process is accurate and preserves the integrity of the images.

This corrected function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version to resolve the issue.
