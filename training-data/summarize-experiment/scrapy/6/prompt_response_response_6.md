Based on the provided information and analysis, the issue lies within the conditional blocks for format and mode conversions, as well as the resizing process in the `convert_image` function.

The bug occurs due to incorrect conditional logic for format and mode conversions, leading to unexpected results in the output image. Additionally, the resizing process is not functioning as intended, resulting in discrepancies in image dimensions.

To fix the bug, we need to:
1. Update the conditional blocks for format and mode conversions to ensure correct handling of different image types.
2. Verify and modify the resizing process to correctly adjust the dimensions of the image based on the provided size parameter.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)  # Rewind the buffer to the beginning
    return image, buf
```

In the revised function, the conditional logic for handling PNG format and RGBA mode images has been updated to accurately create a new background and paste the original image onto it. The resizing process using the `thumbnail` method has also been modified to ensure the correct adjustment of image dimensions. Additionally, the BytesIO buffer is rewound to the beginning before returning it, ensuring that the buffer starts at the beginning of the data.

With these fixes, the `convert_image` function should now correctly handle format and mode conversions, as well as image resizing, resolving the issues identified in the test cases and error messages.
