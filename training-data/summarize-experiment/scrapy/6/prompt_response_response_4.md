Based on the analysis, the bug in the `convert_image` function stems from the incorrect conversion of PNG RGBA images to RGB format. The condition for handling PNG RGBA images is not correctly implemented, leading to unexpected transformations of the images.

To fix the bug, the following approach can be taken:
- Update the conditional block that checks for PNG format and RGBA mode to correctly handle the conversion of images in this format.
- Remove the unconditional creation of a white background and conversion to RGB, as it is not required for images that do not meet the condition for PNG format and RGBA mode.
- Add error handling for incompatible image formats and modes to ensure robust behavior.

Here is the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the revised code:
- The conditional block for handling PNG format and RGBA mode images now directly converts the image to RGB mode, as this is the intended transformation for such images.
- The unnecessary creation of a white background and unconditional conversion to RGB mode have been removed.
- Error handling for incompatible image formats and modes is not explicitly included in this code snippet. Depending on requirements, error handling can be added to handle unsupported image formats and modes.

This corrected code addresses the bug by explicitly handling the conversion of PNG RGBA images to RGB format and simplifying the conditional logic for mode conversion. The revised code can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.
