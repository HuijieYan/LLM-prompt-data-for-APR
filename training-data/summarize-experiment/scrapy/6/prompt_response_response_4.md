Here's the corrected version of the function that fixes the identified bug:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, the bug related to handling the transparency in PNG images has been addressed. Specifically, the following changes were made:
1. In the first conditional block, the background image is now created with the 'RGB' mode instead of 'RGBA' and the transparency issue is fixed by using a white background. This resolves the problem of incorrect color values being returned when dealing with transparency.
2. The pasting process has been updated to correctly paste the input image onto the background.
3. The condition for saving the image as JPEG has been moved outside the conditional block to ensure that the final image is always saved in JPEG format.

By making these adjustments, the function now effectively handles transparency in PNG images and accurately converts and saves images in the desired format, resolving the identified issues with the provided test case logs.
