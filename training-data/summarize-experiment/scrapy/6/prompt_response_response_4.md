Based on the analysis, it appears that the issue primarily lies within the conditional blocks of the `convert_image` function, where the format and mode of the input image are being checked for conversion. 

The bug is likely occurring due to incorrect conditional blocks handling the format and mode conversions, as well as the resizing process not producing the expected results.

To fix the bug, the conditional blocks need to be revised to accurately check and handle the format and mode conversions. Additionally, the resizing process needs to be adjusted to ensure that the image size is correctly modified according to the provided dimensions.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)  # Reset buffer position to the beginning
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected code:
- The conditional block that handles the 'PNG' format and 'RGBA' mode now correctly pastes the original image onto the background.
- The resizing process now accurately creates a thumbnail of the image based on the provided size.
- After saving the modified image to the buffer, the buffer position is reset to the beginning with `buf.seek(0)` to ensure that the buffer contains the entire image data.

This corrected code addresses the issues identified and should resolve the bug in the `convert_image` function.
