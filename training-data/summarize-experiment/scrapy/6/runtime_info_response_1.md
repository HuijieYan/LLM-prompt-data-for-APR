In the provided buggy function code, the purpose of the `convert_image` function is to take an image and an optional size parameter and convert the image to a specified format, then make sure it fits within the specified size, and finally save it as a JPEG file. However, the function is exhibiting unexpected behavior, causing the test cases to fail.

Let's investigate each test case to understand the issue:

### Buggy case 1
In this case, the input image is already in the 'JPEG' format and has a mode of 'RGB' with a size of 100x100. The function is called without a specified size.

The function first checks if the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', but this condition is not met, so it moves on to the next condition. Since the image mode is 'RGB', the function converts the image to 'RGB' format.

After this, the function saves the image as a JPEG file to a buffer and returns both the image and the buffer. The returned buffer is captured as part of the output.

### Buggy case 2
In this case, the input image is also already in the 'JPEG' format with a mode of 'RGB' and a size of 100x100. Additionally, a specific size of 10x25 is provided.

Similar to the previous case, the image format doesn't match 'PNG', so the first condition is not met. Subsequently, it converts the image to the 'RGB' format.

After that, it creates a copy of the image and resizes it to fit within the specified size of 10x25. Then, it saves the new, resized image as a JPEG file to a buffer and returns both the image and the buffer. The returned image is in the expected size and is then captured as part of the output.

### Buggy case 3
In this scenario, the input image is in the 'PNG' format with a mode of 'RGBA' and a size of 100x100. The function is called without a specified size.

Here's where the bug is stemming from. The function checks that the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', which is true. It then creates a new 'RGBA' image of the same size but white in color. It pastes the original 'RGBA' image onto this white background, effectively creating a 'RGBA' image with a white background.

However, the subsequent line mistakenly converts this to an 'RGB' format, causing the loss of transparency along with a change in the output.

After that, it saves the image as a JPEG file to a buffer and returns both the converted image and the buffer. The mismatch in the conversion from 'RGBA' to 'RGB' is likely the issue here.

### Buggy case 4
In this final case, the input image is in the 'P' format with a mode of 'P' and a size of 100x100.

Similar to the previous cases, the function doesn't encounter a situation where the first condition is met, and thus converts the 'P' format image to 'RGB'.

Afterward, the function mistakenly creates a new 'RGBA' image of the same size but white in color and pastes the original image onto this white background, effectively creating an 'RGBA' image with a white background.

It does indeed save the image as a JPEG file to a buffer and return both the image and the buffer. Nevertheless, the unexpected change in converting a 'P' image to 'RGB' and then to an 'RGBA' image is likely the culprit.

### Summary
The root cause of the bug is the conversion from 'RGBA' to 'RGB' when the condition for PNG format and RGBA mode is met. This leads to unexpected transformations of the images and consequently incorrect outputs.

To fix the bug, the function will need to be revised to correctly handle 'RGBA' format images when the format is 'PNG'. The logic for creating a white background and converting it to RGB appears to be incorrect and should be modified or removed.
