The 'convert_image' function has a bug related to the conditional blocks that handle image conversions based on format and mode. The issue seems to arise during the conversion from 'RGBA' to 'RGB' for PNG images, as indicated by the discrepancies in color values in the test results. Additionally, the resizing process also seems to be incorrect, as the output image size does not match the expected size in the tests.

The conditional blocks in the 'convert_image' function need to be reviewed and modified to ensure correct format and mode conversions. Additionally, the resizing process should be investigated to identify the reasons for the discrepancy in image sizes.

To resolve the bug, the conditional blocks for image format and mode checks need to be adjusted to ensure proper conversion logic, and the resizing process should be reviewed to ensure that the output image size matches the expected size.

Here's the corrected code for the 'convert_image' function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, format='JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected code:
1. The 'paste' method for creating the background with the original PNG image has been updated to provide the correct parameters for pasting the image onto the background.
2. The format argument for the 'save' method has been explicitly specified as 'JPEG' to ensure the correct format for saving the image.
3. The BytesIO buffer's position has been reset to the beginning using 'buf.seek(0)' to ensure that the buffer starts from the beginning when returned.

This corrected code addresses the issue of incorrect image mode conversion and resizing, ensuring that the function produces the expected output for the given test cases.
