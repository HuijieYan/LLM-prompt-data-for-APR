Based on the provided information, the bug in the `convert_image` function is likely occurring due to the incorrect handling of images with 'PNG' format and 'RGBA' mode. The current logic creates a white background and pastes the original image onto it, followed by a conversion to 'RGB' mode, which leads to unexpected output and failing test cases.

To resolve the bug, the function should be revised to correctly handle 'RGBA' images with 'PNG' format. The unnecessary creation of a white background and the unconditional conversion to 'RGB' should be addressed.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        converted_image = image.convert('RGB')
    else:
        converted_image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        resized_image = converted_image.copy()
        resized_image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        final_image = resized_image
    else:
        final_image = converted_image

    buf = BytesIO()
    final_image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return final_image, buf
```
In the corrected code:
- We removed the unnecessary creation of a white background and pasting the original image onto it.
- If the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', we directly convert the image to 'RGB' mode.
- The resized image is handled separately, ensuring that the correct image is saved and returned based on the presence of a size parameter.

This corrected code should address the issue with converting PNG RGBA images to RGB mode and ensure correct behavior for the `convert_image` function.

Note: This corrected code assumes that the `resize_image` and `save_image` methods work as expected internally, as they are not provided in the given code.
