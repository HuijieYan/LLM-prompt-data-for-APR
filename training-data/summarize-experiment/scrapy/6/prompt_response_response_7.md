Based on the information provided, the bug in the `convert_image` function likely stems from the conditional blocks responsible for format and mode conversion, as well as the resizing process. Here's a breakdown of the potential issues and possible fixes:

1. Conditional blocks for format and mode conversion: The conditional blocks in the function may not be correctly handling the format and mode of the input image, leading to incorrect format and mode conversions. The code should be reviewed and modified to ensure that the format and mode conversions are applied accurately based on the input image's properties.

2. Resizing process: The resizing process within the function may not be working as intended, as indicated by the discrepancies between the expected and actual image sizes in the test cases. The resizing operation should be thoroughly examined to identify and fix any issues related to image dimensions.

To address these potential issues, the following revised version of the `convert_image` function is provided.

Revised `convert_image` function:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, format='JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)  # Reset buffer position to start
    return image, buf
```

In the revised version of the function, the following changes have been made:
- In the conditional block for PNG and RGBA images, the `paste` method is corrected to specify the position for pasting the image onto the background.
- The `format` parameter is explicitly specified when saving the image to ensure consistent usage.
- Additionally, the buffer position is reset to the start before returning it, ensuring that the buffer contains the entire image data.

This revised function addresses the potential issues related to format and mode conversion, as well as the resizing process. It should resolve the bug and produce the expected results for the test cases.
