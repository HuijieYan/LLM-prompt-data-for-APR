Based on the information provided and the analysis of the test cases and error messages, the bug in the `convert_image` function seems to be related to the conditional blocks for image format and mode checks, as well as the resizing process. The conditional blocks need to be revised to ensure correct format and mode conversions based on the provided image, and the resizing process needs to be adjusted to produce the expected results.

The bug occurs because the conditional blocks for image format and mode checks do not accurately handle the conversion process for different image formats and modes. This results in incorrect conversions, leading to discrepancies in the output images and failed test cases. Additionally, the resizing process does not produce the expected results, which further contributes to the failed test cases.

To fix the bug, the conditional blocks need to be revised to accurately handle the conversion process for different image formats and modes, ensuring that the correct conversions are applied based on the provided image. Additionally, the resizing process needs to be adjusted to properly resize the image to the specified dimensions.

Here is the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the revised code, the conditional block for PNG format and RGBA mode has been updated to create a new image with an 'RGB' format and paste the original image onto it. The conversion to 'RGB' format has been simplified to preserve the format. The resizing process has been adjusted to ensure correct resizing of the image to the specified dimensions.

This corrected code should address the issues with format and mode conversions, as well as the resizing process, and provide the expected output based on the given test cases.
