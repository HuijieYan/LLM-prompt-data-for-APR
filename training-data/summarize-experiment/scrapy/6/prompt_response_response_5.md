Based on the analysis of the provided information, it can be concluded that the bug in the `convert_image` function lies in the conditional blocks where the format and mode of the input image are checked for conversion. Additionally, there is an issue with the resizing of the image when a size parameter is provided.

The bug occurs because the conditional blocks are not correctly handling the format and mode conversions, leading to discrepancies in the output image. Furthermore, the resizing process is not producing the expected results, potentially due to incorrect handling of the size parameter.

To fix the bug, the conditional blocks for format and mode conversion need to be revisited and revised to ensure that the correct transformations are applied based on the input image properties. Additionally, the resizing process should be inspected to address any issues related to handling the size parameter.

Here is the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)  # Reset buffer position to start
    return image, buf
```

In the revised function:
- The conditional block for handling the 'PNG' format and 'RGBA' mode has been updated to correctly handle the creation and conversion of the background image.
- The resizing process using the thumbnail method has been adjusted to ensure that the specified size is applied correctly.
- The BytesIO buffer position is reset to the start before returning it, ensuring that the buffer contains the image data from the beginning.

The revised function should now correctly handle the format and mode conversions, as well as the resizing process, addressing the issues identified in the analysis. This corrected version can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.
