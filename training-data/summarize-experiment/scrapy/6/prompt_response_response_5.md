The error in the provided `convert_image` function is occurring specifically when handling PNG images with RGBA mode. When the function encounters a PNG image with RGBA mode, it incorrectly converts it to an RGB image, leading to unexpected colors in the converted image. This is reflected in the failing test case for transparent images in the RGBA mode.

To fix this bug, the conditional logic for handling PNG images with RGBA mode should be revised to ensure that the conversion to RGB mode is performed correctly. Additionally, the function should include error handling to handle incompatible image formats or modes.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a new blank RGBA image with a white background
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        # Paste the original image onto the white background
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        # Convert the image to RGB mode
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        # Create a copy of the image and resize it to fit within the specified size
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    # Save the modified image to a buffer in JPEG format
    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In this corrected code:
- The conditional block for handling PNG images with RGBA mode has been modified to create a new RGBA image with a white background and then paste the original image onto this background before converting it to RGB mode.
- Error handling for incompatible image formats or modes is not explicitly included in this corrected code. However, it could be added to raise exceptions or handle such cases gracefully based on specific requirements.

This corrected code addresses the bug by ensuring that the conversion from PNG RGBA to RGB mode is performed correctly, resolving the unexpected color issues observed in the failing test case. It also maintains the functionality for converting images to RGB mode and resizing images based on the provided size parameter.
