Please correct the malfunctioning function provided below by using the relevant information listed to address this bug. Then, produce a revised version of the function that resolves the issue. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
from PIL import Image
from cStringIO import StringIO as BytesIO
```

The following is the buggy function that you need to fix:
```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf

    SIZE = (100, 100)
    # straigh forward case: RGB and JPEG
    COLOUR = (0, 127, 255)
    im = _create_image('JPEG', 'RGB', SIZE, COLOUR)

    self.assertEquals(converted.mode, 'RGB')
    self.assertEquals(converted.getcolors(), [(10000, (205, 230, 255))])
```

Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:
The error message is a test failure message, and it is crucial for analyzing the current problems. The error message shows that the specific failing test is the last one. The `convert_image` function does not convert the RGBA PNG image to RGB as expected.

Looking at the test code, the failing test is a transparent image in RGBA that should convert to RGB. The specific sequence of the test that fails is as follows:
- Create an image in PNG format, mode 'RGBA', and specific color with 3 channels and an alpha channel (e.g., test image `(0, 127, 255, 50)`).
- After calling the `convert_image` method, it should convert to RGB. However, the test fails with the following message: `Lists differ: [(10000, (0, 127, 255))] != [(10000, (205, 230, 255))]`. The `getcolors()` method is expected to return `[(10000, (205, 230, 255))]` for the `converted` image, but the obtained result is `[(10000, (0, 127, 255))]`.

Considering the buggy function code, we see it should handle 'PNG' and 'RGBA' mode images. The code snippet that should specifically handle PNG RGBA images is:
```python
if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
```

So, it seems that the problem lies within the conditional path of the buggy function that attempts to handle converting PNG RGBA images. The code within the first conditional block may not be correctly handling the conversion from 'RGBA' to 'RGB' for PNG images.

The failure in the test implies that the logic in the buggy function might not be adequately handling RGBA to RGB conversion for PNG images. This discrepancy results in unexpected colors in the converted image, leading to the failing test case. Further inspection and debugging of the conversion logic specific to PNG RGBA images is required to resolve the error.



## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

In the provided buggy function code, the purpose of the `convert_image` function is to take an image and an optional size parameter and convert the image to a specified format, then make sure it fits within the specified size, and finally save it as a JPEG file. However, the function is exhibiting unexpected behavior, causing the test cases to fail.

Let's investigate each test case to understand the issue:

### Buggy case 1
In this case, the input image is already in the 'JPEG' format and has a mode of 'RGB' with a size of 100x100. The function is called without a specified size.

The function first checks if the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', but this condition is not met, so it moves on to the next condition. Since the image mode is 'RGB', the function converts the image to 'RGB' format.

After this, the function saves the image as a JPEG file to a buffer and returns both the image and the buffer. The returned buffer is captured as part of the output.

### Buggy case 2
In this case, the input image is also already in the 'JPEG' format with a mode of 'RGB' and a size of 100x100. Additionally, a specific size of 10x25 is provided.

Similar to the previous case, the image format doesn't match 'PNG', so the first condition is not met. Subsequently, it converts the image to the 'RGB' format.

After that, it creates a copy of the image and resizes it to fit within the specified size of 10x25. Then, it saves the new, resized image as a JPEG file to a buffer and returns both the image and the buffer. The returned image is in the expected size and is then captured as part of the output.

### Buggy case 3
In this scenario, the input image is in the 'PNG' format with a mode of 'RGBA' and a size of 100x100. The function is called without a specified size.

Here's where the bug is stemming from. The function checks that the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', which is true. It then creates a new 'RGBA' image of the same size but white in color. It pastes the original 'RGBA' image onto this white background, effectively creating a 'RGBA' image with a white background.

However, the subsequent line mistakenly converts this to an 'RGB' format, causing the loss of transparency along with a change in the output.

After that, it saves the image as a JPEG file to a buffer and returns both the converted image and the buffer. The mismatch in the conversion from 'RGBA' to 'RGB' is likely the issue here.

### Buggy case 4
In this final case, the input image is in the 'P' format with a mode of 'P' and a size of 100x100.

Similar to the previous cases, the function doesn't encounter a situation where the first condition is met, and thus converts the 'P' format image to 'RGB'.

Afterward, the function mistakenly creates a new 'RGBA' image of the same size but white in color and pastes the original image onto this white background, effectively creating an 'RGBA' image with a white background.

It does indeed save the image as a JPEG file to a buffer and return both the image and the buffer. Nevertheless, the unexpected change in converting a 'P' image to 'RGB' and then to an 'RGBA' image is likely the culprit.

### Summary
The root cause of the bug is the conversion from 'RGBA' to 'RGB' when the condition for PNG format and RGBA mode is met. This leads to unexpected transformations of the images and consequently incorrect outputs.

To fix the bug, the function will need to be revised to correctly handle 'RGBA' format images when the format is 'PNG'. The logic for creating a white background and converting it to RGB appears to be incorrect and should be modified or removed.



## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

Based on the analysis of the function code and the expected input and output values, the core logic of the function can be summarized as follows:

1. The function takes in an image and an optional size parameter.
2. It first checks if the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'. If so, it creates a new background image with RGBA mode and pastes the original image onto the background. It then converts the image to RGB mode.
3. If the image mode is not RGB, it converts the image to RGB mode.
4. If a size parameter is provided, it creates a copy of the image and resizes it to the specified size using the thumbnail method.
5. Finally, it saves the modified image to a buffer in JPEG format and returns the modified image along with the buffer.

The function also involves operations such as pasting the original image onto a background, converting image modes, creating copies of images, and saving images to a buffer in JPEG format.

The bug in the function may stem from the fact that the background image is created unconditionally, even if the format and mode conditions are not met. Additionally, the mode check is based on the 'PNG' format only, ignoring other formats. The function also lacks error handling for incompatible image formats and modes.
