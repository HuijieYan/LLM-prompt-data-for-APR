The bug in the `convert_image` function is primarily related to the handling of transparency in PNG images. The failing test cases clearly exhibit discrepancies in the expected and actual color values, especially when dealing with transparency. The implementation fails to correctly match the expected color values, leading to inaccurate comparisons.

To address this bug, the conditional checks within the `convert_image` function need to be revisited. The logic for image format and mode identification should be adjusted to ensure that the converted image is saved correctly in JPEG format after any necessary resizing or conversion.

Here's the revised version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        new_image = image.copy()
        new_image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        image = new_image

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)  # Rewind the buffer to the beginning
    return image, buf
```

In the revised function, a new variable `new_image` is introduced to hold the resized or copied image to ensure that the original image is not modified directly. Additionally, the buffer is rewound to the beginning before being returned to ensure that the caller starts reading from the beginning of the buffer.

This revised version addresses the bug by correctly handling the transparency in PNG images and ensuring that the image is saved in the desired JPEG format after any manipulation. It should resolve the issues identified in the failing test cases.
