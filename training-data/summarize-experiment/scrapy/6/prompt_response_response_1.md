The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional block that checks for PNG format and RGBA mode. The code within this block is responsible for the incorrect conversion of RGBA images to RGB, leading to the unexpected outputs and failing test cases.

The bug occurs because the conditional block unconditionally creates a new background image with RGBA mode and pastes the original image onto the background, regardless of the image format and mode. Additionally, the subsequent conversion to RGB mode is also applied unconditionally, leading to incorrect transformations of the images.

To fix the bug, the conditional block for handling PNG format and RGBA mode images needs to be revised to accurately handle the conversion logic for RGBA images. Conditional checks based on image format and mode should be performed accurately to ensure that the correct operations are applied only when necessary.

Additionally, error handling for incompatible image formats and modes should be included to provide robustness to the function.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the revised function, the conditional block that checks for PNG format and RGBA mode has been modified to accurately handle the conversion of RGBA images. The `paste` method now explicitly specifies the position as `(0, 0)` and the image to paste, ensuring that the original image is pasted onto the background. Additionally, error handling for incompatible image formats could be added if necessary to enhance the robustness of the function.

This corrected code can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.
