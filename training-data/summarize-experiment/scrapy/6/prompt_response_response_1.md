The bug in the `convert_image` function seems to be related to the handling of PNG images with transparency. The failing test cases clearly indicate that the expected and actual color values are not matching, especially when dealing with transparency. 

To address this bug, the conditional logic for handling PNG images with transparency needs to be revised. Additionally, the function should ensure that the image is saved in JPEG format after any transformations.

Here's the revised version of the function that resolves the issue:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and 'transparency' in image.info:
        r, g, b, a = image.split()
        image = Image.merge("RGB", (r, g, b))
    if image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```
