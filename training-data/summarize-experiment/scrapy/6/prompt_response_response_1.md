Based on the provided information, the bug in the `convert_image` function seems to be related to the conditional blocks where the format and mode of the input image are being analyzed for conversion. Additionally, the resizing process is not producing the expected results.

The bug occurs because the conditional blocks that handle the format and mode conversions are not properly implemented, resulting in incorrect transformations of the input image.

To fix the bug, the conditional blocks need to be revised to ensure correct format and mode conversions. Additionally, the resizing process should be thoroughly investigated to identify and rectify any issues that are causing it to produce unexpected results.

Here is the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, format='JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)  # Move the pointer to the beginning of the buffer
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected code:
- The conditional block for handling PNG images with RGBA mode has been updated to properly paste the original image onto the background.
- The `save` method for saving the image as JPEG now explicitly specifies the format as 'JPEG'.
- After saving the image to the buffer, the pointer of the buffer is moved to the beginning to ensure that the entire image data is captured.

This revised function addresses the issues identified and should now produce the expected results for handling image format and mode conversions, as well as resizing the image when a size parameter is provided.
