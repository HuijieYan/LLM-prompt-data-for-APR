Based on the provided information, it appears that the bug in the `convert_image` function is related to the conditional blocks where the format and mode of the input image are being checked. Additionally, there seems to be an issue with the resizing process, as the images are not matching the expected size after the function call. This could be due to incorrect conditional checks or improper handling of resizing the images.

Considering the expected parameters and return values, the function should handle different image types and ensure that the final output is always in 'RGB' format. To fix the bug, the conditional blocks need to be reviewed and modified to ensure correct format and mode conversions. The resizing process also needs to be investigated to ensure that the images are being resized to the specified dimensions as expected.

With that in mind, here is the corrected code for the `convert_image` function that addresses the identified issues:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)
    return image, buf
```

In this corrected version of the function:
- The paste operation within the conditional block for PNG and RGBA images has been adjusted to ensure proper pasting of the original image onto the background.
- The image.mode != 'RGB' condition now correctly converts the image to RGB mode.
- The resizing operation has been revised to ensure that the image is resized to the specified dimensions using the ANTIALIAS resampling filter.
- Finally, the BytesIO buffer is now being reset to the beginning before returning it along with the modified image.

This corrected function should now handle the format and mode conversions as well as the resizing process accurately, addressing the identified bug.
