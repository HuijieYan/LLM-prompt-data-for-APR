Here is a corrected version of the `convert_image` function that resolves the identified bug:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    # ... other code ...

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            # Fix: Create a new RGBA image with a white background
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

In the corrected version, the issue of converting PNG RGBA images to RGB has been addressed. The updated code creates a new RGBA image with a white background, pastes the original image onto this background, and then converts it to RGB. This ensures that the transparency information is preserved during the conversion process, fixing the bug identified in the failing test case.

Additionally, the use of the `BytesIO` class from the `io` module has been updated in the import statement and used in the function, as the original code was using the deprecated `cStringIO` module for creating the buffer.

Replacing the buggy `convert_image` function with the corrected version will resolve the bug and ensure that image conversions, especially for PNG RGBA images, are handled correctly.
