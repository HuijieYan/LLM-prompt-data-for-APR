The potential error in the provided `convert_image` function is related to the conditional checks for image format and mode, as well as the handling of transparency in PNG images. The bug occurs when the function fails to accurately match expected color values, especially when dealing with transparency in PNG images.

To fix the bug, we need to re-evaluate the conditional checks within the `convert_image` function and ensure the correct handling of transparency in PNG images. Additionally, the function should properly save the converted images in JPEG format.

Here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In this corrected version:
1. In the first conditional block, we create a new image with an RGB mode background (to prevent the loss of transparency) and then paste the input image onto the new background. We then assign the new image to the `image` variable.
2. We removed the unnecessary conversion of the background to RGBA and the subsequent conversion of the new image back to RGB.
3. We ensure that the final image is saved as JPEG to the buffer, addressing the issues identified in the test cases.
