Based on the provided information, the bug in the `convert_image` function is likely occurring due to incorrect handling of PNG RGBA images during the conversion process. The function fails to properly convert PNG RGBA images to RGB, resulting in unexpected color output.

To resolve this issue, the following steps can be taken:

1. Address the conditional check for PNG and RGBA mode images to ensure that the conversion logic is applied only when the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA.
2. Remove the unconditional creation of a new background image with a white background and the subsequent conversion to RGB, as this is causing the unexpected color output.

Considering these steps, here's the corrected version of the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        new_image = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))  # Create a new RGB image with a white background
        new_image.paste(image, (0, 0), image)  # Paste the original RGBA image onto the new RGB image
        image = new_image  # Assign the new RGB image to the variable 'image'

    if image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')  # Convert the image to RGB mode if it's not already in RGB mode

    if size:  # Check if a size parameter is provided
        image = image.copy()  # Create a copy of the image
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)  # Resize the image to fit within the specified size using the thumbnail method

    buf = BytesIO()  # Create a BytesIO buffer
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')  # Save the modified image to the buffer in JPEG format
    return image, buf  # Return the modified image and the buffer
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the conditional check for PNG RGBA images and removes the unconditional creation of a background image with white background, ensuring that the conversion logic is applied only when necessary. Additionally, it properly handles the conversion to RGB and the resizing of the image based on the provided size parameter.
