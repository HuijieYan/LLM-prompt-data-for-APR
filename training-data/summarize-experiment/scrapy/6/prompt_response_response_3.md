The bug in the `convert_image` function lies in the conditional statements and the saving of the image as JPEG. The bug occurs because the function doesn't properly handle the conversion and saving of images, especially when dealing with transparency in PNG images. 

To fix the bug, we need to re-evaluate the conditional checks within the `convert_image` function. Additionally, the function should save the image as a JPEG after resizing or converting.

Here's the revised version of the function that resolves the issue:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, format='JPEG', quality=95)
    buf.seek(0)

    return image, buf
```

In this revised version, we have added the correct parameters for the `paste` method to properly paste the input image onto the new background. Additionally, the `save` method now explicitly specifies the format as JPEG and sets the quality to 95. Finally, we ensure that the buffer's position is set to the beginning before returning it.

This revised function will properly handle PNG images with transparency and save images in the correct format, resolving the identified issues with the provided test case logs.
