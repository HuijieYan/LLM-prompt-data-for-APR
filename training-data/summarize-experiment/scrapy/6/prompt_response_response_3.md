The potential error location within the `convert_image` function is in the conditional blocks that handle format and mode conversions, as well as the image resizing process. The bug is likely occurring due to the incorrect conditional logic in the function, leading to improper format and mode conversions as well as the resizing process not functioning as expected.

To fix the bug, the conditional blocks for format and mode conversions need to be updated to ensure correct transformations. Additionally, the resizing process should be reviewed and revised to ensure that the image is resized to the specified dimensions as per the input parameter.

Here is the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))  # Create a new RGB background image
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)  # Paste the RGBA image onto the RGB background
        image = background  # Set the modified image as the new image
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')  # Convert the image to RGB mode

    if size:
        image = image.copy()  # Create a copy of the image
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)  # Resize the image with the specified dimensions using ANTIALIAS resampling

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')  # Save the modified image as JPEG
    return image, buf  # Return the modified image and its corresponding buffer
```

The updates include:
1. When handling PNG RGBA images, create a new RGB background image, paste the RGBA image onto it, and set the modified image as the new image.
2. Updated the conditional block to handle mode conversion and changed the method to directly convert to RGB mode for non-RGB images.
3. Updated the resizing process to create a copy of the image and then apply the thumbnail resizing operation.

These changes address the issues related to incorrect conditional logic for format and mode conversions, as well as the improper image resizing process. This corrected code ensures that the `convert_image` function correctly handles format and mode conversions and image resizing according to the provided input parameters.
