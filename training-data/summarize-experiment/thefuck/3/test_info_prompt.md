Given the source code of a function that exhibits bugs, along with the source code of its corresponding test function and the error messages resulting from the execution of a failed test case, your task is to meticulously extract and articulate relevant and critical information from both the test code and the error messages. This detailed narrative is essential for accurately diagnosing and resolving the errors within the buggy function. To enhance the precision of your analysis, you are encouraged to directly reference specific segments of both the buggy function's code and the test code. It is also advisable, for the sake of clarity, to sometimes focus on only the most pertinent portions of the test function code, omitting sections that do not directly contribute to understanding the problem at hand. Your output should be thorough and elaborative. This approach aims to encourage a comprehensive and profound exploration of the provided code and error messages.

The following is the buggy function code:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)

```

The followings are test functions under directory `tests/shells/test_fish.py` in the project.
```python
def test_info(self, shell, Popen):
    Popen.return_value.stdout.read.side_effect = [b'fish, version 3.5.9\n']
    assert shell.info() == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'
    assert Popen.call_args[0][0] == ['fish', '--version']
```

The error message that corresponds the the above test functions is:
```
self = <tests.shells.test_fish.TestFish object at 0x7fb8d3a45250>
shell = <thefuck.shells.fish.Fish object at 0x7fb8d3bd0290>
Popen = <MagicMock name='Popen' id='140431801350288'>

    def test_info(self, shell, Popen):
        Popen.return_value.stdout.read.side_effect = [b'fish, version 3.5.9\n']
>       assert shell.info() == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'
E       AssertionError: assert 'Fish Shell f...version 3.5.9' == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'
E         - Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9
E         + Fish Shell 3.5.9
