The issue in the `info` function is that it is using the wrong command to get the Fish shell version and also not properly decoding the output to get the version number. The function is trying to capture the version by running the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION', which is not the correct way to retrieve the Fish shell version.

To fix the bug, we need to use the correct command to get the Fish shell version. We should run 'fish --version' instead to retrieve the version and properly decode the output to extract the version.

Additionally, we should also use the `communicate` method of the `Popen` object to properly handle the command output instead of directly reading from `stdout`.

Here is the corrected version of the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this fix, the function will correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell and return the expected output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' as per the test case.
