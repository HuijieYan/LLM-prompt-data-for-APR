Based on the provided information, the issue seems to be with the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version in the `info` function of the `Fish` class. The `Popen` call is using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, while the test is expecting the version to be retrieved using the command `fish --version`.

The potential error location is the line where the `Popen` command is instantiated in the `info` function.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `Popen` call is using the incorrect command to retrieve the Fish shell version, leading to a mismatch in the expected and actual values when the test is run.

To fix the bug, the command passed to the `Popen` call in the `info` function should be changed to `['fish', '--version']` in order to retrieve the Fish shell version as expected. Additionally, the `.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` should be replaced with `.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()` to properly retrieve the output of the command.

Here is the corrected code for the `info` function of the `Fish` class:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip().split(' ')[-1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
This corrected code should resolve the issue and produce the expected result when the test is run.
