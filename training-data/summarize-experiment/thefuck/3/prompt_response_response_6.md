Based on the information provided and the analysis of the bug, it is clear that the issue lies in the command being executed by the Popen function inside the info method of the Fish class. The command should be 'fish --version' instead of 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION', which is causing the incorrect version output.

Additionally, it is important to properly handle the Popen call and the decoding of the output to ensure that the function works as intended.

Here's the revised version of the function that resolves the issue and includes proper error handling:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except Exception as e:
            return "Error retrieving shell information: " + str(e)
```

This revised version of the function addresses the bug by using the correct command for obtaining the version of the Fish shell and includes a try-except block to handle any potential errors that may occur during the Popen call or when decoding the output. This ensures that the function works as intended and returns the correct shell information.

The revised function covers the following aspects:
1. Corrects the command for obtaining the shell version by using 'fish --version'.
2. Implements error handling to capture and handle any exceptions that may occur during the Popen call or when decoding the output.
3. Returns an error message if any exceptions are encountered to provide clarity on the issue.

This revised version can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function, effectively resolving the issue.
