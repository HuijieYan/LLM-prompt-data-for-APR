The test case `test_info` is comparing the output of the `info` function which is supposed to return the version of the Fish shell, but the output includes the string "Fish Shell" along with the version. This discrepancy is causing the assertion error in the test case.

It seems that the issue is with the string format used in the `info` function. The function is prepending "Fish Shell" to the version retrieved from the shell, which is not matching the expected value in the test case.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `info` function to only return the version without prepending "Fish Shell" to it.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return version
```

With this modification, the function will now only return the version without any additional text. This should resolve the assertion error in the test case.

The corrected code can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the `info` function.
