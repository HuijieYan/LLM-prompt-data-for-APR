The test function `test_info` is testing the `info` method of the `Fish` class. The `Popen` object is being mocked and returned value is created using the `side_effect` attribute.

The Popen object is created in the `info` method of the `Fish` class. It executes the command  `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` and reads the output that should be the version of the fish shell.

The test case is failing with the following error:
```
AssertionError: assert 'Fish Shell f...version 3.5.9' == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'
```
This error message shows that the actual output from the `info` method is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'` whereas the expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`

Analyzing the `info` method, it is observed that the Popen call contains the wrong command argument. It should be `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`.

Hence, the fix to this bug would be to change the `Popen` command inside the `info` method from `'fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` to `'fish', '--version'`. This change would ensure that the correct version information is obtained and the test case should pass successfully.
