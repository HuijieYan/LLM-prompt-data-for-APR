Based on the provided code snippet and the variable logs, it seems that the issue lies in the `Popen` object and how the stdout is being read.

The `info` function is intended to return the name and version of the current shell by running a command using the `Popen` function and capturing the output. The command being run is `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`, which should return the version of the Fish Shell.

From the variable runtime value and type inside the buggy function for the first test case:
- The `proc` variable is a MagicMock object that simulates the `Popen` function call.
- The `version` variable is a string with the value `'3.5.9'`.
- The `proc.stdout.read` is a MagicMock object.
- The `proc.stdout` is also a MagicMock object.

Given that the value of `version` is accurate, it seems like the issue might be with how the output from the `Popen` command is being read.

Looking at the code, the issue seems to be with how `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` is being used to capture the output. It's possible that the `Popen` call is not being executed properly, leading to MagicMock objects being returned instead of the actual output from the command.

To address this issue, the code for capturing the output should be revised to ensure that the `Popen` command is executed correctly and the output is read and decoded properly. Additionally, error handling should be implemented to handle cases where the `Popen` call fails or the output cannot be properly captured.
