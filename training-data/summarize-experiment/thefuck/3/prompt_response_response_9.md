1. The test case `test_info` is trying to assert that the output of `shell.info()` is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'. However, the actual output includes the string 'fish, version' from the command. This indicates that the `info` function is not correctly parsing the version information from the command output.

2. The potential error location is within the `info` function, specifically in the way it reads and processes the output from the `Popen` command.

3. The bug is occurring because the `info` function is not correctly processing the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command. The command is returning the version string along with additional characters, and the function is not correctly parsing out only the version number.

4. One possible approach for fixing the bug is to use a regular expression to extract only the version number from the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command. This will ensure that only the version number is returned by the `info` function.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
import re

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version_output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8')
    match = re.search(r'\d+\.\d+\.\d+', version_output)
    version = match.group(0) if match else 'unknown'
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This revised function uses a regular expression to extract the version number from the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command. This should ensure that the function correctly processes the version information and returns only the version number.
