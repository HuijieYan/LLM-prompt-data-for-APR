The error in the code is caused by the incorrect command used to get the Fish Shell version. The command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' is not correct and needs to be replaced with 'fish --version' to correctly obtain the version number.

The reason for the bug is that the 'echo $FISH_VERSION' command does not return the version number of the Fish Shell. This causes the test to fail when comparing the expected version ('Fish Shell 3.5.9') with the incorrect version obtained from the 'echo $FISH_VERSION' command ('fish, version 3.5.9').

To fix the bug, we need to update the command used to obtain the Fish Shell version to 'fish --version'.

Here is the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this updated code, the `info` function will correctly obtain the Fish Shell version using the 'fish --version' command, resolving the issue and allowing the test case to pass.
