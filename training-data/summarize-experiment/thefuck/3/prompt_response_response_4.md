The error in the buggy function is occurring because the command being used to get the Fish shell version is incorrect. The command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' is not the correct way to get the Fish shell version.

To fix this bug, the 'fish' command with the '--version' flag should be used to get the Fish shell version.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This fix will use the correct command to get the Fish shell version and return the expected output, resolving the issue identified in the bug report.
