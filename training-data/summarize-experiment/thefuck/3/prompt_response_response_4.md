Based on the provided information, the bug in the `info` method of the `Fish` class is due to the incorrect command being executed using `Popen`. The command `'fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` should be replaced with `['fish', '--version']` to retrieve the version of the Fish Shell correctly.

The revised version of the function to fix this bug is as follows:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This correction ensures that the correct command is executed to obtain the version of the Fish Shell, and the output is captured and processed accurately. This revised function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.
