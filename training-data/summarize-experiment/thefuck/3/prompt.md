Please correct the malfunctioning function provided below by using the relevant information listed to address this bug. Then, produce a revised version of the function that resolves the issue. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE
from ..utils import DEVNULL, cache
```

The following is the buggy function that you need to fix:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)

```



## Functions Used in the Buggy Function
```python# class declaration containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    # ... omitted code ...


```



## Test Functions and Error Messages Summary
The followings are test functions under directory `tests/shells/test_fish.py` in the project.
```python
def test_info(self, shell, Popen):
    Popen.return_value.stdout.read.side_effect = [b'fish, version 3.5.9\n']
    assert shell.info() == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'
    assert Popen.call_args[0][0] == ['fish', '--version']
```

Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:
The test function `test_info` is testing the `info` method of the `Fish` class. The `Popen` object is being mocked and returned value is created using the `side_effect` attribute.

The Popen object is created in the `info` method of the `Fish` class. It executes the command  `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` and reads the output that should be the version of the fish shell.

The test case is failing with the following error:
```
AssertionError: assert 'Fish Shell f...version 3.5.9' == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'
```
This error message shows that the actual output from the `info` method is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'` whereas the expected output is `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`

Analyzing the `info` method, it is observed that the Popen call contains the wrong command argument. It should be `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`.

Hence, the fix to this bug would be to change the `Popen` command inside the `info` method from `'fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` to `'fish', '--version'`. This change would ensure that the correct version information is obtained and the test case should pass successfully.



## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

Based on the provided code snippet and the variable logs, it seems that the issue lies in the `Popen` object and how the stdout is being read.

The `info` function is intended to return the name and version of the current shell by running a command using the `Popen` function and capturing the output. The command being run is `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`, which should return the version of the Fish Shell.

From the variable runtime value and type inside the buggy function for the first test case:
- The `proc` variable is a MagicMock object that simulates the `Popen` function call.
- The `version` variable is a string with the value `'3.5.9'`.
- The `proc.stdout.read` is a MagicMock object.
- The `proc.stdout` is also a MagicMock object.

Given that the value of `version` is accurate, it seems like the issue might be with how the output from the `Popen` command is being read.

Looking at the code, the issue seems to be with how `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` is being used to capture the output. It's possible that the `Popen` call is not being executed properly, leading to MagicMock objects being returned instead of the actual output from the command.

To address this issue, the code for capturing the output should be revised to ensure that the `Popen` command is executed correctly and the output is read and decoded properly. Additionally, error handling should be implemented to handle cases where the `Popen` call fails or the output cannot be properly captured.



## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

The function takes no input parameters and returns a string in the format of "Fish Shell {version}". 

Within the function, it uses the Popen function from the subprocess module to execute a command in a subshell and retrieves the output. The command being executed is `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`, which retrieves the version of the current shell. 

The output of this command is read and decoded from bytes to a string, which is then stripped of any whitespace.

The function then returns a string in the format of "Fish Shell {version}".

The expected return value for the test case provided is "Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9".



## Summary of the GitHub Issue Related to the Bug

Summary:
The issue details a bug in the Oh-My-Fish plugin "TheFuck" which causes the Fish Shell initialization to hang due to the usage of the command "thefuck -v". This command triggers a recursive loop in shells/fish.py:Fish.info(), leading to the issue. The bug has been identified and a fix is currently being worked on. The reference for this bug can be found at oh-my-fish/plugin-thefuck#11. 

Insights:
- The bug occurs due to the usage of the command "thefuck -v" by the Oh-My-Fish plugin "TheFuck".
- The recursive loop is triggered by the function shells/fish.py:Fish.info().
- A fix for the issue is in progress, indicating that the developers are actively working on resolving it.

Recommendations for debugging:
1. It is crucial to test the proposed fix thoroughly to ensure that it effectively resolves the recursive loop triggered by the "thefuck -v" command.
2. Collaborative discussions with other developers and contributors can provide valuable insights and potential alternative solutions for addressing the bug.
3. Detailed documentation of the bug and the proposed fix should be maintained to aid in future debugging processes and for the reference of other developers.
