The problem with the `info` function is that it is fetching the version number with the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but the expected version number in the test is different, `fish, version 3.5.9`. This discrepancy causes the assertion error in the test.

To fix this issue, the function should be updated to fetch the version using the `--version` flag with the `fish` command, as expected in the test case.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()  # Extracting version number from the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this fix, the function will accurately fetch the version of the Fish shell and return it in the expected format. This updated function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
