Based on the analysis, the issue lies in the `Popen` command within the `info` function. The command should be `'fish', '--version'` instead of `'fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`. This change will ensure that the correct version information is obtained and returned.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

Above is the corrected `info` function that resolves the issue by using the correct command to retrieve the version of the Fish Shell. This fix should address the bug and ensure that the function returns the expected output.

This corrected code can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.
