The potential error in the problematic function lies in the `Popen` call, specifically in the command being executed. The command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` is intended to retrieve the version of the Fish Shell, but it is using a subshell command to echo the value of `$FISH_VERSION`. This approach can lead to inconsistencies and incorrect version retrieval.

To fix the bug, the `Popen` command should be changed to `['fish', '--version']`, which directly retrieves the version of the Fish Shell without relying on environment variables or subshell commands.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
