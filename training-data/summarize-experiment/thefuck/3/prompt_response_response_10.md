The buggy function `info` is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, but it currently has issues reading the version from the subprocess. The issue is related to how the version is being read from the subprocess and formatted.

The error message from the test indicates that the version returned by the function includes unexpected characters like "fish, version" which should be stripped out. This suggests that the subprocess command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is not providing the expected output.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to read the version information in the correct way and format it properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split()[-1]  # Get the last word, which is the version number
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this fix, the function uses the `--version` flag to get the version information directly from the shell, and then extracts the version number from the output by splitting the string and taking the last word.

This should resolve the issue and provide the expected version string without any extra characters.

You can use the corrected function as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
