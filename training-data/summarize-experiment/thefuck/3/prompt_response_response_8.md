The error in the provided function stems from the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version. The function tries to retrieve the version using the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION', but the actual command should be 'fish --version'. This is evident from the error message, which shows the difference between the expected and actual output.

To fix the bug, the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version should be corrected to 'fish --version', and the function should be updated to capture the output of this new command.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version, the function should now return the expected output and resolve the bug.
