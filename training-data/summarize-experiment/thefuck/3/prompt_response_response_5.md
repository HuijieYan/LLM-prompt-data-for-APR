The potential error location within the problematic function is the line `version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()`. This line tries to read the stdout of the process, but it's not returning the expected output.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `stdout.read()` call on the mock object is not returning the expected value, which leads to the incorrect version being retrieved.

To fix the bug, we need to mock the `stdout.read()` call to return the expected value, which is `'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

This fix involves changing the command from `echo $FISH_VERSION` to `fish --version` to get the correct version and then parsing the version from the output. This should resolve the issue and provide the correct version of the Fish Shell.
