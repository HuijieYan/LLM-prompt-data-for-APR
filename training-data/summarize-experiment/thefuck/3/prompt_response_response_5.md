The error message indicates that the expected output is "Fish Shell 3.5.9" but the actual output is "Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9". This suggests that the `info` function in the `Fish` class is not correctly parsing the version information from the shell.

The issue is likely with the command being used to retrieve the version information from the shell. The buggy function is using the command `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` to retrieve the version, but it should be using `['fish', '--version']` instead.

To fix the bug, the command used to retrieve the version information needs to be corrected. 

Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(",")[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This fix uses the correct command to retrieve the version information (`['fish', '--version']`). Additionally, it modifies the parsing of the version string to extract only the version number and eliminates the unwanted "fish, version" part.

By making these changes, the `info` function should now correctly retrieve and format the version information for the Fish shell. This corrected function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
