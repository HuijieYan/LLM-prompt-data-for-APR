Based on the analysis of the provided buggy function and the related test cases, it is clear that the issue lies within the logic of identifying and removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options from the list of 'command.script_parts'. This logic is not functioning as expected, leading to incorrect modifications and unexpected outputs. 

To address the bug, it is essential to revisit the conditional logic for identifying and removing these options from the list. Careful consideration of the index values and the validity of the removal based on the presence of these options is crucial. Additionally, the code should be reviewed to ensure that it correctly handles different scenarios and produces the intended output.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument.
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        if option in command.script_parts:
            index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            command.script_parts.pop(index)
            if index < len(command.script_parts):
                command.script_parts.pop(index)  # Remove the argument
            break

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected code, a loop is used to iterate through the options '--set-upstream' and '-u' and remove them along with their arguments from the 'command.script_parts' list if they are present. This approach ensures that the correct indices are located and that the removal of these options from the list results in the expected command structure.

This revised function should effectively address the bug by properly handling the removal of the target elements from 'command.script_parts' based on their presence and validity, as well as producing the desired output. It is recommended to thoroughly test the revised function with various command scenarios to ensure its reliability and effectiveness across a wider range of cases.
