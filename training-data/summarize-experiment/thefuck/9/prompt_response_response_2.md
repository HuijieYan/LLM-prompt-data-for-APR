Based on the error message and the analysis of the provided buggy function, the issue stems from the manipulation of the `command.script_parts` list and the handling of the `upstream_option_index`. The `IndexError` is caused by the flawed indexing and use of the `pop` method on `command.script_parts`.

To address this bug, the following steps should be taken:
1. Review the logic for determining the `upstream_option_index` and ensure that it accurately identifies the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in `command.script_parts`.
2. Correct the usage of the `pop` method on `command.script_parts`. Ensure that it is aligned with the intended logic and only removes the appropriate elements based on the `upstream_option_index` value.
3. Verify that the extraction of `push_upstream` from `command.stderr` is consistent and accurate.

Here is the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The revised function includes proper error handling for finding the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` in `command.script_parts`. Additionally, the logic for removing the elements from `command.script_parts` based on `upstream_option_index` has been updated to address the `IndexError` issue. This corrected version should resolve the bug and prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.
