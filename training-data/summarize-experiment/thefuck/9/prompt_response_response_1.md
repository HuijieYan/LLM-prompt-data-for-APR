The buggy function attempts to modify a git command by removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' flag and its corresponding argument, and then replacing the 'push' part of the command with a value extracted from the standard error output. The detected error occurs due to an incorrect logic to remove the target elements from `command.script_parts`, leading to an `IndexError` during test execution.

Based on the provided information and observed variable values, it is evident that the core problem lies in the logic related to the removal or handling of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' flag and its corresponding argument. The function seems to attempt to identify and remove them, but the observed behavior indicates that it does not carry out this operation as expected.

A potential fix for the issue is to revisit the logic around identifying and removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options and their corresponding arguments. A thorough review of the conditions and how they interact with the 'command.script_parts' list is crucial. The goal is to ensure that the correct indices are located and that the removal of these options from the list results in the expected command structure.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if "--set-upstream" in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # This line was missing
    elif "-u" in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # This line was missing

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected code ensures that the correct indices are located and the removal of the options from the list results in the expected command structure. Additionally, thorough testing with various command scenarios should be conducted to ensure the fixed function behaves as intended across a wider range of cases.
