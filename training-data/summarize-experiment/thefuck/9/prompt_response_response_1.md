Based on the test cases and error message provided, the main issue lies within the `get_new_command` function at the segment where the value of `upstream_option_index` is determined and used to manipulate the `command.script_parts` list. This results in an `IndexError` due to incorrect handling of the index when calling the `pop` method on `command.script_parts`.

The root cause of the bug is likely the mishandling of the `upstream_option_index` logic, leading to incorrect index values and subsequent `pop` operations on `command.script_parts`. Additionally, the conditional logic for updating `upstream_option_index` based on the presence of `-u` or `--set-upstream` options needs to be carefully reconsidered to ensure correct behavior.

To address this bug, it is advisable to revise the logic for determining `upstream_option_index` and the subsequent manipulation of `command.script_parts`. Validating the conditions for the presence of `-u` or `--set-upstream` options and ensuring the use of correct index values when operating on `command.script_parts` will be crucial for resolving the `IndexError`.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        try:
            upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        except ValueError:
            upstream_option_index = -1
    
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # After removing the option, also remove its argument if present
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The revised code first attempts to find the index of `--set-upstream`. If not found, it then attempts to find the index of `-u`. If neither is found, `upstream_option_index` is set to -1. Then, it checks if the index is valid before removing the option and its argument from `command.script_parts`. This approach aims to ensure that the correct index is used and that the `pop` operations are performed only when valid and necessary.

This corrected code should address the `IndexError` and handle the manipulation of `command.script_parts` more accurately based on the presence of `-u` or `--set-upstream` options. The logic for determining `upstream_option_index` has been revised to better align with the intended behavior, which should lead to the resolution of the bug.
