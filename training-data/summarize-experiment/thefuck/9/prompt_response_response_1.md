Given the test case and the error message "IndexError: pop index is out of range," it is clear that the issue is related to the popping of elements from the `command.script_parts` list without validating the index's existence. The `upstream_option_index` variable is not properly assigned a value or not assigned at all, leading to the IndexError.

The buggy code attempts to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` argument and its associated parameter, assuming they exist in the `command.script_parts` list. However, the function does not handle the scenario where the `-u` option might not exist or might exist at a different index in `command.script_parts`. It also hardcodes the value of `push_upstream`, leading to incorrect outputs.

To fix the bug, we need to add a check to ensure that the value of `upstream_option_index` is a valid index before attempting to pop elements. Additionally, we need to dynamically handle the presence of the `-u` or `--set-upstream` arguments and construct the `push_upstream` value accordingly, rather than hardcoding it.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

With these changes, the function now correctly handles the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` arguments and dynamically constructs the `push_upstream` value based on the `stderr` output. This revised code ensures that the popping of elements is performed only when the valid index exists in the list, preventing the IndexError from occurring.
