From the failed testing messages, we have a clear indication of what the problem might be. The error message "IndexError: pop index is out of range" points to the buggy function code which attempts to pop elements from a list based on their index without checking whether the index exists or not. This most likely means that the `upstream_option_index` variable is not being assigned as expected or possibly not assigned at all.

In the test function `test_get_new_command`, we can see that the stderr is expected to contain "fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch", and replace it with "git push --set-upstream origin master" if called with 'git push -u', and similar commands. This provides effective insight into what the expected functionality should be and gives a good indication of where to locate the problem within the buggy function. 

In the buggy function `get_new_command`, the problematic segment of code is as follows: 
```python
if upstream_option_index is not -1:
    command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
```
The issue here is that it assumes upstream_option_index is always correctly assigned. If the string '--set-upstream' or '-u' does not exist in the command.script_parts, then the `upstream_option_index` is assigned the default value of -1 which causes command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index) to raise an IndexError.

To fix this, we'll need to add an extra check to ensure that the value of `upstream_option_index` is actually an index that exists in the list before attempting to pop elements. This can be done using an `if` statement before popping the elements.

The correction would be:
```python
if upstream_option_index != -1:
    command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
```

By incorporating these changes into the code, we can ensure that the error "IndexError: pop index out of range" is resolved and that the `upstream_option_index` is only used when it points to a valid index within the list.
