The error message indicates that the test case `test_get_new_command` in the file `tests/rules/test_git_push.py` has failed, specifically at line 26, as indicated by the presence of `tests/rules/test_git_push.py:26` within the error message. Additionally, the error message shows that the failed assertion is associated with the command `test_get_new_command(Command('git push -u', stderr=stderr))` present within the failed test function.

The line of code that triggers the error is within the buggy function itself, at line 32: `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)`. The error provided in the error message is `IndexError: pop index out of range`. This error occurs when trying to remove an item from a list at an index that is out of range, i.e., not within the valid range of indices for the list.

The implementation of the `get_new_command` function appears to be the cause of the issue. The function first attempts to find the index of specific commands in `command.script_parts` and then, if found, removes them along with their preceding item. 

On analyzing the test cases, it is noted that they are multiple tests with different commands and asserts to be verified. All the test cases are formatted in the format of `assert get_new_command(Command('some_command', stderr=stderr)) == "expected_result"`. The first and second test cases check the output when 'git push' and 'git push -u' commands are passed, respectively. 

The error message indicates that the issue stems from the attempt to pop an element from `command.script_parts` which is not suited for the specific assertion on line 26 in the test function. This popping of elements inside the buggy function `get_new_command` is what leads to the `IndexError`, which is confirmed by the error message indicating that `command.script_parts` has a 'pop index out of range' error.

Hence, the cause of the bug is identified within the `get_new_command` function. The erroneous logic to remove the target elements from `command.script_parts` is leading to an `IndexError` during test execution. Fixing this logic to remove the elements conditionally, based on their presence in `command.script_parts` and its validity, will likely resolve the issue.
