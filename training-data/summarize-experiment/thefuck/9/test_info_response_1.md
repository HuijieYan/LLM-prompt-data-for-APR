The test_file for the function `get_new_command` contains several test cases, which are used to evaluate whether the function returns the expected output given a specific input. The `stderr` parameter of the `get_new_command` function is utilized in each case, and the result of calling `get_new_command` with a `Command` object and the `stderr` parameter is then compared to an expected value using the `assert` statement. The test cases seem to aim at verifying the behavior of the `get_new_command` function in different scenarios involving the `git push` command and its various options.

The error message indicates a failure which occurs when calling `get_new_command` with `Command('git push -u', stderr=stderr)`. Referring to the error message, the failure occurs in line 27 of the file `thefuck/rules/git_push.py`, where an `IndexError` is raised, more specifically an `IndexError: pop index out of range`.

Given the information present in the error message, it's evident that the root of the issue lies within the `get_new_command` function. More precisely, the problematic segment involves operations related to the `Command` script parts and the handling of the `upstream_option_index`. Delving into the buggy function, it is the portion where the value of `upstream_option_index` is determined and utilized that seems to be causing the problem. The overall functionality of the function is to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` arguments from `command.script_parts` and retrieve the information following the `stderr` input to create and return the resultant command.

The error message features a segment of the source code for the `get_new_command` function where the issue occurs:
```python
...
if upstream_option_index is not -1:
    command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
...
```
The above portion of the `get_new_command` function is where the problematic `command.script_parts.pop` calls are made. The intention of this section of the code is to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the `command.script_parts` list. However, it appears that the indexing of the `pop` operation is causing the issue, leading to an `IndexError`.

Based on the error and the source code, it's crucial to identify the root cause of the `IndexError`. A likely culprit is the incorrect manipulation of the list while checking for the existence of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options. Double checking the logic for manipulating the command script parts, particularly the identified segment that removes items using `pop`, could potentially reveal the source of the issue.

Addressing the `IndexError` by reviewing and correcting the code segment responsible for manipulating `command.script_parts` will likely resolve the problem and prevent the `IndexError` from being raised when executing the `get_new_command` function. Additionally, further detail on how the `upstream_option_index` is determined, specifically if its value is correct and valid or not, would be beneficial for pinpointing the root cause and implementing a successful fix for the issue.
