The issue with the `get_new_command` function seems to stem from the manipulation of the `command.script_parts` list and the handling of the `upstream_option_index` variable. The current code results in an `IndexError` due to incorrect indexing and popping of elements in `command.script_parts`, particularly when checking for the presence of `--set-upstream` or `-u`. Additionally, the determination and utilization of the `upstream_option_index` variable may be flawed, leading to unexpected behavior.

To address this bug, it's necessary to:
- Review and correct the logic for manipulating `command.script_parts`, ensuring that the indexing and popping of elements are done appropriately without causing an `IndexError`.
- Revisit how `upstream_option_index` is determined and used, ensuring that the correct index is identified and the subsequent actions are in line with the intended behavior.

With these adjustments, the `get_new_command` function should be able to handle the `git push` command and its various options correctly, resolving the failing test cases and preventing the `IndexError` from being raised.

The revised version of the `get_new_command` function that addresses the identified issues is as follows:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index + 1)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the revised version, the handling of `upstream_option_index` has been updated to correctly identify the occurrence of `--set-upstream` or `-u` without causing an `IndexError`. Additionally, the manipulation of `command.script_parts` has been adjusted to remove the options and their arguments as intended. These changes aim to resolve the bug and ensure the function operates as expected.
