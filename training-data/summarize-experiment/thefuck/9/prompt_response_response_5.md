Based on the provided information, it is clear that the bug in the `get_new_command` function arises from the incorrect logic for removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options and their corresponding arguments. The observed behavior indicates that these removal operations do not function as intended, leading to unexpected outputs and failing test cases. 

To address the bug, the logic for identifying and removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options and their arguments should be thoroughly reviewed and revised. Additionally, comprehensive testing with various command scenarios is essential to ensure that the fixed function behaves as intended across a wider range of cases.

Below is the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the revised version of the function, the conditions for removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options and their arguments have been adjusted. Now, the removal operations are directly handled within the try-except blocks that identify the indices of these options. This ensures that the removal is performed when the respective option is found in the `command.script_parts` list.

By applying these changes, the corrected function aims to address the bug by properly removing the target elements from `command.script_parts` and accurately manipulating the `push_upstream` variable. This should result in the generation of the expected command structure and resolve the failing test cases associated with the previous buggy behavior.
