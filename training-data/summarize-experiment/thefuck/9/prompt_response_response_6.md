Based on the provided information, the potential error in the problematic function `get_new_command` is located within the logic related to the removal or handling of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options and their corresponding arguments. The function attempts to identify and remove them, but the observed behavior indicates that it does not carry out this operation as expected. This leads to incorrect modifications to the generated `push_upstream` variable and ultimately results in unexpected outputs.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to revise the logic to accurately identify the indices of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options and their corresponding arguments within the `command.script_parts` list. The conditions for their removal from the list should be carefully evaluated to ensure the correct operation.

Furthermore, the retrieval of the upstream branch from the stderr output should be validated to accurately capture the expected value consistently across different scenarios.

The corrected version of the `get_new_command` function is provided below. This version addresses the identified bug by revising the logic for identifying and removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options and their arguments. Additionally, it ensures the accurate extraction of the upstream branch from the stderr output.

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(index)
        command.script_parts.pop(index)  # Remove the argument as well

    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(index)
        command.script_parts.pop(index)  # Remove the argument as well

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function revises the logic for identifying and removing the target options and their arguments. It also ensures the accurate retrieval of the upstream branch from the stderr output. With these improvements, the function should behave as intended and address the identified bug.
