The bug in the provided function `get_new_command` is related to the incorrect handling of the `upstream_option_index` and the subsequent manipulation of the `command.script_parts` list. When the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options are not found in the `command.script_parts` list, the `upstream_option_index` is correctly set to `-1`. However, when the options are present, the logic for removing them from the list using `pop` is flawed, leading to an `IndexError` when attempting to pop elements beyond the valid range of the list.

The key issue is that the `pop` calls should only be made once, regardless of whether the `--set-upstream` or `-u` option is found. Additionally, the determination of the correct index for removal is crucial to prevent index out of range errors.

To fix the bug, the logic for finding and removing the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from `command.script_parts` needs to be revised. The `upstream_option_index` should be accurately determined and used to remove the options from the list just once, instead of attempting multiple removals.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        # Also remove the argument of the option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This revised version of the function addresses the bug by accurately determining the index of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options and by removing them from `command.script_parts` only once, along with their corresponding arguments. This modification should prevent the `IndexError` from occurring and resolve the issues identified in the test cases.
