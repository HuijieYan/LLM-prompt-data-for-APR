Based on the provided information, it appears that the bug in the `get_new_command` function is related to how the `upstream_option_index` is determined and utilized, as well as the subsequent manipulation of the `command.script_parts` list using the `pop` method. The root cause of the issue seems to stem from the incorrect handling of the index and the subsequent removal of elements from the list.

The logic for determining the `upstream_option_index` should be thoroughly reviewed to ensure that it accurately identifies the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u`, and the subsequent removal of elements from `command.script_parts` using `pop` should be carefully revised based on the requirements.

Additionally, it is crucial to ensure that the extraction of the new command from the `stderr` is consistent and accurate across different scenarios involving the `git push` command and its various options.

To address the bug, the following approach is suggested:
1. Review and update the logic for determining `upstream_option_index` to accurately identify the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u`.
2. Revise the code segment that handles the removal of elements from `command.script_parts` to ensure it aligns with the intended logic and does not lead to an `IndexError`.
3. Confirm and validate the extraction of the new command from the `stderr` to ensure it produces the correct and consistent output.

The corrected version of the `get_new_command` function is provided below, addressing the identified issues:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        del command.script_parts[upstream_option_index:upstream_option_index+2]

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The updated function addresses the issues related to determining `upstream_option_index` and manipulating the `command.script_parts` list, ensuring that the logic is accurate and the `IndexError` is avoided. Additionally, the extraction of the new command from the `stderr` remains consistent and accurate across different scenarios. This corrected version can serve as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version and is expected to resolve the identified bug.
