Based on the provided information, it is evident that the core issue lies in the logic related to identifying and removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options and their corresponding arguments from the `command.script_parts` list. The conditions to find and remove them are not working as expected, leading to incorrect modifications to the generated 'push_upstream' variable and unexpected outputs.

To address this bug, it is crucial to thoroughly review and revise the logic for identifying and removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options. Additionally, proper handling of the indices and removal operations on the `command.script_parts` list is essential to ensure that the modifications result in the expected command structure.

A potential approach to fixing the bug involves:
1. Refactoring the logic to accurately find the indices of '--set-upstream' or '-u' options in `command.script_parts` and handle their removal based on their presence.
2. Ensuring the removal of the option and its preceding argument from `command.script_parts` is done in a way that prevents index out of range errors.
3. Verifying the extraction of the upstream branch from the stderr output to ensure it aligns with the expected format and content.
4. Testing the revised function with a diverse set of command scenarios to validate its behavior across various cases.

Based on these considerations, a corrected version of the `get_new_command` function is provided below:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Remove --set-upstream or -u and their arguments if present
    for option in ['--set-upstream', '-u']:
        if option in command.script_parts:
            option_index = command.script_parts.index(option)
            if option_index < len(command.script_parts) - 1:
                command.script_parts.pop(option_index + 1)
            command.script_parts.pop(option_index)
    
    # Extract the upstream branch from stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    
    # Replace 'push' with the extracted upstream branch
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This revised version of the `get_new_command` function includes refactored logic to handle the removal of '--set-upstream' or '-u' options and their arguments without causing index out of range errors. Additionally, it ensures proper extraction of the upstream branch from the stderr output and replaces 'push' with the extracted upstream branch in the final command.

This corrected function is intended to address the identified bug by improving the integrity and correctness of the command modification process. However, thorough testing is essential to validate its behavior across a variety of command scenarios for full confidence in its functionality.
