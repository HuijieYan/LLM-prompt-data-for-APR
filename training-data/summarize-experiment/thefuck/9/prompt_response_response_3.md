The issue in the `get_new_command` function seems to be related to the manipulation of the `command.script_parts` list using the `pop` method based on the `upstream_option_index` value. The error message indicates an `IndexError` occurring when attempting to pop items from the list. This is likely due to incorrect indexing or invalid index values being used.

To fix the bug, the logic for determining and utilizing the `upstream_option_index` should be reviewed and corrected. Additionally, the use of the `pop` method on `command.script_parts` should be revised to ensure that it aligns with the intended logic and does not lead to `IndexError` exceptions.

The corrected version of the function is as follows:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1

    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        upstream_option_index = -1

    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        # The index should be decremented by one after removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' option
        if upstream_option_index < len(command.script_parts):
            command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```
