Based on the provided information, a potential fix for the bug is to revise the logic for identifying and removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options and their corresponding arguments from the `command.script_parts` list. Currently, the function is encountering an `IndexError` due to the popping of elements from the list without proper validation.

Approach for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use a conditional check to find the indices of '--set-upstream' and '-u' in the `command.script_parts` list.
2. If the indices are found, remove the elements from the list only if they are within the valid range of indices.
3. Ensure that the modifications to the `command.script_parts` list are accurately reflected before the generation of the `push_upstream` variable.

Revised Function:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Find the indices of '--set-upstream' and '-u' in the script parts
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')

    # Remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options and their arguments from the list if found
    if upstream_option_index != -1 and upstream_option_index + 1 < len(command.script_parts):
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index + 1)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    # Extract the upstream branch from the stderr output
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]

    # Replace the 'push' argument with the extracted upstream branch
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The revised function ensures that the removal of elements from the `command.script_parts` list is performed only if the indices are within the valid range. This approach aims to prevent the occurrence of an `IndexError` when attempting to remove elements from the list. Additionally, the logic for generating the `push_upstream` variable remains unchanged.

The revised function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function, addressing the identified bug and providing the expected behavior for the `get_new_command` function.
