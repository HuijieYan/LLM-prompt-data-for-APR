Based on the information provided, it appears that the `IndexError` is most likely caused by the incorrect manipulation of the `command.script_parts` list in the `get_new_command` function. The issue seems to be related to the removal of items using the `pop` method, specifically with the `upstream_option_index` logic.

The function `get_new_command` needs to be revised to ensure that the `upstream_option_index` is handled correctly and that the `pop` operations do not result in an `IndexError`. Additionally, the logic for determining `upstream_option_index` based on the presence of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options needs to be reviewed and fixed.

To address this issue, the logic for determining the `upstream_option_index` should be revised to properly handle both cases of `--set-upstream` and `-u` in the command script parts list. Additionally, the removal of items from `command.script_parts` using the `pop` method should be adjusted to ensure the correct indexing and removal of elements.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_new_command` function that resolves the issue:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    except ValueError:
        pass

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The revised `get_new_command` function corrects the flawed logic for handling `upstream_option_index` and the subsequent removal of items from `command.script_parts`. This should resolve the `IndexError` and ensure that the function behaves as expected for the provided test cases.
