The bug in the provided function `get_new_command` is caused by the logic related to the removal of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options and their corresponding arguments. The function attempts to identify and remove them from the `command.script_parts` list, but the observed behavior indicates that it does not carry out this operation as expected. This results in incorrect modifications to the generated `push_upstream` variable and ultimately leads to unexpected outputs.

To fix this bug, it is crucial to thoroughly review the conditions and how they interact with the `command.script_parts` list. The goal is to ensure that the correct indices are located and that the removal of these options from the list results in the expected command structure. Further investigation is warranted to analyze the command modification logic in depth and identify the exact source of the issue.

Potential approaches for fixing the bug include refining the conditions for identifying and removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options and their corresponding arguments. Ensuring that the conditions accurately capture the presence and position of these options within the `command.script_parts` list is crucial. Additionally, verifying the handling of the `push_upstream` variable generation is essential to produce the correct output command.

Moreover, comprehensive testing with various command scenarios could help ensure that the fixed function behaves as intended across a wider range of cases.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    if '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

The corrected version of the `get_new_command` function includes refined conditions for identifying and removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options and their corresponding arguments from the `command.script_parts` list. This revision aims to address the issue by ensuring the accurate handling of these options and producing the correct output command.
