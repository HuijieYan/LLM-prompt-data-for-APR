Please correct the malfunctioning function provided below by using the relevant information listed to address this bug. Then, produce a revised version of the function that resolves the issue. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support
```

The following is the buggy function that you need to fix:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index is not -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```



## Test Functions and Error Messages Summary
The followings are test functions under directory `tests/rules/test_git_push.py` in the project.
```python
def test_get_new_command(stderr):
    assert get_new_command(Command('git push', stderr=stderr))\
        == "git push --set-upstream origin master"
    assert get_new_command(Command('git push -u', stderr=stderr))\
        == "git push --set-upstream origin master"
    assert get_new_command(Command('git push -u origin', stderr=stderr))\
        == "git push --set-upstream origin master"
    assert get_new_command(Command('git push --set-upstream origin', stderr=stderr))\
        == "git push --set-upstream origin master"
    assert get_new_command(Command('git push --quiet', stderr=stderr))\
        == "git push --set-upstream origin master --quiet"
```

Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:
The test_file for the function `get_new_command` contains several test cases, which are used to evaluate whether the function returns the expected output given a specific input. The `stderr` parameter of the `get_new_command` function is utilized in each case, and the result of calling `get_new_command` with a `Command` object and the `stderr` parameter is then compared to an expected value using the `assert` statement. The test cases seem to aim at verifying the behavior of the `get_new_command` function in different scenarios involving the `git push` command and its various options.

The error message indicates a failure which occurs when calling `get_new_command` with `Command('git push -u', stderr=stderr)`. Referring to the error message, the failure occurs in line 27 of the file `thefuck/rules/git_push.py`, where an `IndexError` is raised, more specifically an `IndexError: pop index out of range`.

Given the information present in the error message, it's evident that the root of the issue lies within the `get_new_command` function. More precisely, the problematic segment involves operations related to the `Command` script parts and the handling of the `upstream_option_index`. Delving into the buggy function, it is the portion where the value of `upstream_option_index` is determined and utilized that seems to be causing the problem. The overall functionality of the function is to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` arguments from `command.script_parts` and retrieve the information following the `stderr` input to create and return the resultant command.

The error message features a segment of the source code for the `get_new_command` function where the issue occurs:
```python
...
if upstream_option_index is not -1:
    command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
...
```
The above portion of the `get_new_command` function is where the problematic `command.script_parts.pop` calls are made. The intention of this section of the code is to remove the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options from the `command.script_parts` list. However, it appears that the indexing of the `pop` operation is causing the issue, leading to an `IndexError`.

Based on the error and the source code, it's crucial to identify the root cause of the `IndexError`. A likely culprit is the incorrect manipulation of the list while checking for the existence of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` options. Double checking the logic for manipulating the command script parts, particularly the identified segment that removes items using `pop`, could potentially reveal the source of the issue.

Addressing the `IndexError` by reviewing and correcting the code segment responsible for manipulating `command.script_parts` will likely resolve the problem and prevent the `IndexError` from being raised when executing the `get_new_command` function. Additionally, further detail on how the `upstream_option_index` is determined, specifically if its value is correct and valid or not, would be beneficial for pinpointing the root cause and implementing a successful fix for the issue.



## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

In the provided function, `get_new_command`, the goal is to process a `Command` object, extract information from its `stderr`, and return a new command using the extracted information. However, there are some issues present in the code that caused test cases to fail.

Let's analyze the function's behavior with respect to the runtime values and types provided.

In the first case, for the input `command.script_parts` with a value of `['git', 'push']` and the specific `command` object given, the value of `upstream_option_index` is `-1`, indicating that the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` was not found. However, the subsequent line `push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]` seems to be extracting the desired new command correctly, resulting in the value `'push --set-upstream origin master'`.

In the second, third, and fourth cases, the flow goes as follows:
- The value of `upstream_option_index` is correctly identified as `2` when `'-u'` is included in `command.script_parts`.
- However, the subsequent updates to `command.script_parts` based on `upstream_option_index` may be flawed since `pop` is called twice, which may not be in line with the intended logic.
- The extracted `push_upstream` value appears to be consistent across these cases as `'push --set-upstream origin master'`.

Finally, in the fifth case, where the input for `command.script_parts` is `['git', 'push', '--quiet']`, the issue of the index not being found remains, leading to `upstream_option_index` being set to `-1`. The `push_upstream` value, on the other hand, remains consistent at `'push --set-upstream origin master'`.

With this analysis, it's evident that the key issue lies in the handling of `upstream_option_index` and the subsequent modification of `command.script_parts`. The use of the `pop` method on `command.script_parts` may be incorrect, and the `upstream_option_index` logic update is conditional and needs to be carefully reconsidered based on the requirements. Further examination of the logic around these elements and the expected behavior is warranted to resolve the failing test cases.



# Expected return value in tests
## Expected case 1
### Input parameter value and type
command.script_parts, value: `['git', 'push']`, type: `list`

    git push --set-upstream origin master

)`, type: `Command`

command.stderr, value: `'fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.\nTo push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use\n\n    git push --set-upstream origin master\n\n'`, type: `str`

upstream_option_index, expected value: `-1`, type: `int`

hub push --set-upstream josephfrazier tmp -u josephfrazier [enter/↑/↓/ctrl+c]
Instead, the suggestion should be git push --set-upstream josephfrazier tmp, like it was before #538 was merged. I'll see if I can put together a fix for this.
