Please correct the malfunctioning function provided below by using the relevant information listed to address this bug. Then, produce a revised version of the function that resolves the issue. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support
```

The following is the buggy function that you need to fix:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index is not -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)

```



## Test Functions and Error Messages Summary
The followings are test functions under directory `tests/rules/test_git_push.py` in the project.
```python
def test_get_new_command(stderr):
    assert get_new_command(Command('git push', stderr=stderr))\
        == "git push --set-upstream origin master"
    assert get_new_command(Command('git push -u', stderr=stderr))\
        == "git push --set-upstream origin master"
    assert get_new_command(Command('git push -u origin', stderr=stderr))\
        == "git push --set-upstream origin master"
    assert get_new_command(Command('git push --set-upstream origin', stderr=stderr))\
        == "git push --set-upstream origin master"
    assert get_new_command(Command('git push --quiet', stderr=stderr))\
        == "git push --set-upstream origin master --quiet"
```

Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:
The error message indicates that the test case `test_get_new_command` in the file `tests/rules/test_git_push.py` has failed, specifically at line 26, as indicated by the presence of `tests/rules/test_git_push.py:26` within the error message. Additionally, the error message shows that the failed assertion is associated with the command `test_get_new_command(Command('git push -u', stderr=stderr))` present within the failed test function.

The line of code that triggers the error is within the buggy function itself, at line 32: `command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)`. The error provided in the error message is `IndexError: pop index out of range`. This error occurs when trying to remove an item from a list at an index that is out of range, i.e., not within the valid range of indices for the list.

The implementation of the `get_new_command` function appears to be the cause of the issue. The function first attempts to find the index of specific commands in `command.script_parts` and then, if found, removes them along with their preceding item. 

On analyzing the test cases, it is noted that they are multiple tests with different commands and asserts to be verified. All the test cases are formatted in the format of `assert get_new_command(Command('some_command', stderr=stderr)) == "expected_result"`. The first and second test cases check the output when 'git push' and 'git push -u' commands are passed, respectively. 

The error message indicates that the issue stems from the attempt to pop an element from `command.script_parts` which is not suited for the specific assertion on line 26 in the test function. This popping of elements inside the buggy function `get_new_command` is what leads to the `IndexError`, which is confirmed by the error message indicating that `command.script_parts` has a 'pop index out of range' error.

Hence, the cause of the bug is identified within the `get_new_command` function. The erroneous logic to remove the target elements from `command.script_parts` is leading to an `IndexError` during test execution. Fixing this logic to remove the elements conditionally, based on their presence in `command.script_parts` and its validity, will likely resolve the issue.



## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

Based on the provided buggy function code and the runtime variable values and types inside the function, we can see that the function is designed to modify a git command based on certain conditions.

The function tries to identify and remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' flag and its corresponding argument from the input command. It then extracts the upstream branch from the error message in the standard error output of the git command and creates a new command by replacing the 'push' part of the input command with the extracted upstream branch.

Now, let's analyze the observed variable values and types during the execution of the buggy function for each of the provided test cases.

In Buggy case 1:
- The input command includes only 'git push', and the 'command.script_parts' is a list with the value ['git', 'push'].
- The standard error message indicates that the current branch has no upstream branch and suggests using 'git push --set-upstream origin master'.
- The 'upstream_option_index' variable has a value of -1.
- The 'push_upstream' variable holds the value 'push --set-upstream origin master'.

In Buggy case 2:
- The input command includes 'git push -u', and the 'command.script_parts' is a list with the value ['git', 'push', '-u'].
- The standard error message remains the same as in Buggy case 1.
- The 'upstream_option_index' variable has a value of 2, indicating the index of the '-u' flag in the 'command.script_parts' list.
- The 'command.script_parts' list has not been modified according to the conditions from the code.
- The 'push_upstream' variable holds the value 'push --set-upstream origin master'.

In Buggy case 3:
- The input command includes 'git push -u origin', and the 'command.script_parts' is a list with the value ['git', 'push', '-u', 'origin'].
- The standard error message remains the same as in the previous cases.
- The 'upstream_option_index' variable has a value of 2.
- The 'command.script_parts' list has not been modified as expected.
- The 'push_upstream' variable holds the value 'push --set-upstream origin master'.

In Buggy case 4:
- The input command includes 'git push --set-upstream origin', and the 'command.script_parts' is a list with the value ['git', 'push', '--set-upstream', 'origin'].
- The standard error message remains constant.
- The 'upstream_option_index' variable has a value of 2.
- The 'command.script_parts' list remains unchanged despite the presence of the '--set-upstream' flag and its argument.
- The 'push_upstream' variable holds the value 'push --set-upstream origin master'.

In Buggy case 5:
- The input command includes 'git push --quiet', and the 'command.script_parts' is a list with the value ['git', 'push', '--quiet'].
- The standard error message remains constant.
- The 'upstream_option_index' variable has a value of -1.
- The 'push_upstream' variable holds the value 'push --set-upstream origin master'.

From the observed variable values and the provided function code, we can conclude that the core problem lies in the logic related to the removal or handling of the '--set-upstream' or '-u' flag and its corresponding argument. The function seems to attempt to identify and remove them, but the observed behavior indicates that it does not carry out this operation as expected.

It is evident that the conditions to find and remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options are not working properly based on the provided test cases and the observed variable values. This is the root cause of the failing test cases. The erroneous behavior leads to incorrect modifications to the generated 'push_upstream' variable and ultimately results in unexpected outputs.

Based on the provided information, a potential fix for the issue is to revisit the logic around identifying and removing the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options and their corresponding arguments. A thorough review of the conditions and how they interact with the 'command.script_parts' list is crucial. The goal is to ensure that the correct indices are located and that the removal of these options from the list results in the expected command structure.

Further investigation is warranted to analyze the command modification logic in depth and identify the exact source of the issue. Additionally, comprehensive testing with various command scenarios could help ensure that the fixed function behaves as intended across a wider range of cases.



## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

The function `get_new_command` takes in a parameter `command` of type `Command` and a parameter `command.script_parts` of type `list`. The function first checks if the script_parts contain the strings '--set-upstream' or '-u', and if so, it removes them from the list. 

Next, it retrieves the string after the 'git' portion of the stderr output, and assigns this string to the variable `push_upstream`. 

Finally, it returns the result of replacing the argument 'push' with the value of `push_upstream` in the concatenated string of `command.script_parts`.

The analysis is based on examining how the input parameters `command` and `command.script_parts` are used in the function and how their specific values are related to the output value of the function. The specific values that are used to verify the logic of the function are taken from the test cases and expected variable values before the function returns.
