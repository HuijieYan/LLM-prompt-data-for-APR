Please correct the malfunctioning function provided below by using the relevant information listed to address this bug. Then, produce a revised version of the function that resolves the issue. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
from thefuck.utils import replace_argument
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support
```

The following is the buggy function that you need to fix:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index is not -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)

```



## Test Case Summary
From the failed testing messages, we have a clear indication of what the problem might be. The error message "IndexError: pop index is out of range" points to the buggy function code which attempts to pop elements from a list based on their index without checking whether the index exists or not. This most likely means that the `upstream_option_index` variable is not being assigned as expected or possibly not assigned at all.

In the test function `test_get_new_command`, we can see that the stderr is expected to contain "fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch", and replace it with "git push --set-upstream origin master" if called with 'git push -u', and similar commands. This provides effective insight into what the expected functionality should be and gives a good indication of where to locate the problem within the buggy function. 

In the buggy function `get_new_command`, the problematic segment of code is as follows: 
```python
if upstream_option_index is not -1:
    command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
```
The issue here is that it assumes upstream_option_index is always correctly assigned. If the string '--set-upstream' or '-u' does not exist in the command.script_parts, then the `upstream_option_index` is assigned the default value of -1 which causes command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index) to raise an IndexError.

To fix this, we'll need to add an extra check to ensure that the value of `upstream_option_index` is actually an index that exists in the list before attempting to pop elements. This can be done using an `if` statement before popping the elements.

The correction would be:
```python
if upstream_option_index != -1:
    command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
    command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
```

By incorporating these changes into the code, we can ensure that the error "IndexError: pop index out of range" is resolved and that the `upstream_option_index` is only used when it points to a valid index within the list.



## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

Looking at the function code, the first thing we can observe is that this is a Python function decorated by `@git_support`. The function takes a parameter named `command` of type `Command`, and its `script_parts` attribute is used within the function.

In the `try-except` blocks, the function attempts to find the index of the `--set-upstream` and `-u` in the `command.script_parts`. If found, the index of the argument is used to pop it from the list of `command.script_parts`. However, if `--set-upstream` is not present, then we attempt to find the `-u` and similarly pop it if it exists.

After that, the function uses the `stderr` attribute of the `command` parameter to retrieve the `push_upstream` value. The last line of the function replaces the argument 'push' with the `push_upstream` value using the `replace_argument` function, which is not available in the provided code.

Let's discuss the variable runtime values for each buggy case:

### Buggy Case 1:
- In this case, the `upstream_option_index` is set to -1, and `push_upstream` becomes `'push --set-upstream origin master'`. 
- The value of `upstream_option_index` doesn't change from its initial -1, suggesting that the condition `if upstream_option_index is not -1` will evaluate to true. This shouldn't be the intended behavior as `upstream_option_index` is initially set to -1 and is never updated to a different value to fulfill the condition.

### Buggy Case 2, 3, 4, 5:
- In all these cases, the function doesn't correctly handle the presence of the `-u` option in the input argument. The index of this argument is hardcoded to be popped from `command.script_parts` regardless of its actual index within the list. 
- Furthermore, the `push_upstream` value is hardcoded to `'push --set-upstream origin master'`, which doesn't account for different scenarios.

Based on the runtime values and context. It's clear that the buggy function fails to correctly handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` arguments and the subsequent construction of the `push_upstream` string based on the output. This leads to incorrect modification of the `command.script_parts` argument and incorrect formation of the `push_upstream` value. The function needs to be corrected to dynamically handle the presence of the `-u` or `--set-upstream` arguments and to create the `push_upstream` value based on the correct output.

A fixed version of the function would dynamically handle the `-u` or `--set-upstream` arguments and use it to create the `push_upstream` string accordingly. Additionally, the use of hardcoded values needs to be avoided to ensure the function works correctly across different scenarios.



# Expected return value in tests
## Expected case 1
### Input parameter value and type
command.script_parts, value: `['git', 'push']`, type: `list`

command, value: `Command(script=git push, stdout=, stderr=fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin master

)`, type: `Command`

command.stderr, value: `'fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.\nTo push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use\n\n    git push --set-upstream origin master\n\n'`, type: `str`

### Expected variable value and type before function return
upstream_option_index, expected value: `-1`, type: `int`

push_upstream, expected value: `'push --set-upstream origin master'`, type: `str`

hub push --set-upstream josephfrazier tmp -u josephfrazier [enter/↑/↓/ctrl+c]
Instead, the suggestion should be git push --set-upstream josephfrazier tmp, like it was before #538 was merged. I'll see if I can put together a fix for this.
