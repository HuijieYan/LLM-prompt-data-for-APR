Given the source code of a function that exhibits bugs, along with the source code of its corresponding test function and the error messages resulting from the execution of a failed test case, your task is to meticulously extract and articulate relevant and critical information from both the test code and the error messages. This detailed narrative is essential for accurately diagnosing and resolving the errors within the buggy function. To enhance the precision of your analysis, you are encouraged to directly reference specific segments of both the buggy function's code and the test code. It is also advisable, for the sake of clarity, to sometimes focus on only the most pertinent portions of the test function code, omitting sections that do not directly contribute to understanding the problem at hand. Your output should be thorough and elaborative. This approach aims to encourage a comprehensive and profound exploration of the provided code and error messages.

The following is the buggy function code:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index is not -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)

```

The followings are test functions under directory `tests/rules/test_git_push.py` in the project.
```python
def test_get_new_command(stderr):
    assert get_new_command(Command('git push', stderr=stderr))\
        == "git push --set-upstream origin master"
    assert get_new_command(Command('git push -u', stderr=stderr))\
        == "git push --set-upstream origin master"
    assert get_new_command(Command('git push -u origin', stderr=stderr))\
        == "git push --set-upstream origin master"
    assert get_new_command(Command('git push --set-upstream origin', stderr=stderr))\
        == "git push --set-upstream origin master"
    assert get_new_command(Command('git push --quiet', stderr=stderr))\
        == "git push --set-upstream origin master --quiet"
```

The error message that corresponds the the above test functions is:
```
stderr = 'fatal: The current branch master has no upstream branch.\nTo push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use\n\n    git push --set-upstream origin master\n\n'

    def test_get_new_command(stderr):
        assert get_new_command(Command('git push', stderr=stderr))\
            == "git push --set-upstream origin master"
>       assert get_new_command(Command('git push -u', stderr=stderr))\
            == "git push --set-upstream origin master"
