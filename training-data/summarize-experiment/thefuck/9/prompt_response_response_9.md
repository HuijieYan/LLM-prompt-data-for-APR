Since you mentioned that the import statements are available in the environment, we can proceed with fixing the buggy function.

1. The error is occurring due to incorrect handling of the `upstream_option_index` and subsequent manipulation of `command.script_parts`.

2. The error seems to be located in the block of code where the value of `upstream_option_index` is determined and used to manipulate `command.script_parts`.

3. The bug is likely occurring because the code is incorrectly manipulating the `command.script_parts` list using the `pop` method. Additionally, the logic for determining the value of `upstream_option_index` may not be correctly capturing the presence of '--set-upstream' or '-u'.

4. To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the value of `upstream_option_index` is correctly identified based on the presence of '--set-upstream' or '-u', and then handle the removal of the options from `command.script_parts` accordingly.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `get_new_command` function that resolves the issue:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # Check for the presence of '--set-upstream' or '-u'
    if '--set-upstream' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    elif '-u' in command.script_parts:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    else:
        upstream_option_index = -1

    # Remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' and its argument from command.script_parts
    if upstream_option_index != -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the option
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove its argument

    # Extract push_upstream from command.stderr
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]

    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

This corrected version of the function ensures that the `upstream_option_index` is correctly identified based on the presence of '--set-upstream' or '-u'. Then, the options and their arguments are removed from `command.script_parts` as needed. Additionally, the extraction of `push_upstream` from `command.stderr` remains unchanged.

The correction should address the bug and prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.
