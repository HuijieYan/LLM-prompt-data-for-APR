Based on the analysis of the provided bug and the runtime variables, the issue with the buggy function `get_new_command` stems from the incorrect handling of the removal of '--set-upstream' or '-u' options and their corresponding arguments from the `command.script_parts` list. This incorrect handling leads to unexpected modifications to the generated `push_upstream` variable and ultimately results in incorrect outputs.

To fix the bug, the function needs to accurately identify the indices of '--set-upstream' or '-u' options in the `command.script_parts` list and remove them along with their preceding arguments. Additionally, the logic to extract the upstream branch from the stderr output needs to be verified for correctness.

Here's the corrected version of the function `get_new_command`:

```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    command_parts = command.script_parts.copy()  # Create a copy of the script_parts list

    # Remove --set-upstream or -u options and their arguments
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command_parts.index('--set-upstream')
        command_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument as well
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command_parts.index('-u')
        command_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)  # Remove the argument as well
    except ValueError:
        pass

    # Extract the upstream branch from the stderr output
    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]

    # Replace 'push' with the extracted upstream branch
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command_parts), 'push', push_upstream)
```

In the corrected function:
1. We create a copy of the `command.script_parts` list to ensure that the original list is not modified directly.
2. We use the copied `command_parts` list to identify and remove the '--set-upstream' or '-u' options and their arguments.
3. We verify the logic to extract the upstream branch from the stderr output and replace 'push' with the extracted upstream branch.

This revised function addresses the issues observed in the original function and is intended to produce the correct output for the provided test cases.

By applying these changes, the function should now accurately handle the removal of '--set-upstream' or '-u' options and their arguments and generate the expected command based on the extracted upstream branch from the stderr output.
