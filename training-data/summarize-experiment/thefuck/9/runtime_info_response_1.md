Looking at the function code, the first thing we can observe is that this is a Python function decorated by `@git_support`. The function takes a parameter named `command` of type `Command`, and its `script_parts` attribute is used within the function.

In the `try-except` blocks, the function attempts to find the index of the `--set-upstream` and `-u` in the `command.script_parts`. If found, the index of the argument is used to pop it from the list of `command.script_parts`. However, if `--set-upstream` is not present, then we attempt to find the `-u` and similarly pop it if it exists.

After that, the function uses the `stderr` attribute of the `command` parameter to retrieve the `push_upstream` value. The last line of the function replaces the argument 'push' with the `push_upstream` value using the `replace_argument` function, which is not available in the provided code.

Let's discuss the variable runtime values for each buggy case:

### Buggy Case 1:
- In this case, the `upstream_option_index` is set to -1, and `push_upstream` becomes `'push --set-upstream origin master'`. 
- The value of `upstream_option_index` doesn't change from its initial -1, suggesting that the condition `if upstream_option_index is not -1` will evaluate to true. This shouldn't be the intended behavior as `upstream_option_index` is initially set to -1 and is never updated to a different value to fulfill the condition.

### Buggy Case 2, 3, 4, 5:
- In all these cases, the function doesn't correctly handle the presence of the `-u` option in the input argument. The index of this argument is hardcoded to be popped from `command.script_parts` regardless of its actual index within the list. 
- Furthermore, the `push_upstream` value is hardcoded to `'push --set-upstream origin master'`, which doesn't account for different scenarios.

Based on the runtime values and context. It's clear that the buggy function fails to correctly handle the removal of the `--set-upstream` or `-u` arguments and the subsequent construction of the `push_upstream` string based on the output. This leads to incorrect modification of the `command.script_parts` argument and incorrect formation of the `push_upstream` value. The function needs to be corrected to dynamically handle the presence of the `-u` or `--set-upstream` arguments and to create the `push_upstream` value based on the correct output.

A fixed version of the function would dynamically handle the `-u` or `--set-upstream` arguments and use it to create the `push_upstream` string accordingly. Additionally, the use of hardcoded values needs to be avoided to ensure the function works correctly across different scenarios.
