In the provided function, `get_new_command`, the goal is to process a `Command` object, extract information from its `stderr`, and return a new command using the extracted information. However, there are some issues present in the code that caused test cases to fail.

Let's analyze the function's behavior with respect to the runtime values and types provided.

In the first case, for the input `command.script_parts` with a value of `['git', 'push']` and the specific `command` object given, the value of `upstream_option_index` is `-1`, indicating that the index of `--set-upstream` or `-u` was not found. However, the subsequent line `push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]` seems to be extracting the desired new command correctly, resulting in the value `'push --set-upstream origin master'`.

In the second, third, and fourth cases, the flow goes as follows:
- The value of `upstream_option_index` is correctly identified as `2` when `'-u'` is included in `command.script_parts`.
- However, the subsequent updates to `command.script_parts` based on `upstream_option_index` may be flawed since `pop` is called twice, which may not be in line with the intended logic.
- The extracted `push_upstream` value appears to be consistent across these cases as `'push --set-upstream origin master'`.

Finally, in the fifth case, where the input for `command.script_parts` is `['git', 'push', '--quiet']`, the issue of the index not being found remains, leading to `upstream_option_index` being set to `-1`. The `push_upstream` value, on the other hand, remains consistent at `'push --set-upstream origin master'`.

With this analysis, it's evident that the key issue lies in the handling of `upstream_option_index` and the subsequent modification of `command.script_parts`. The use of the `pop` method on `command.script_parts` may be incorrect, and the `upstream_option_index` logic update is conditional and needs to be carefully reconsidered based on the requirements. Further examination of the logic around these elements and the expected behavior is warranted to resolve the failing test cases.
