Please correct the malfunctioning function provided below by using the relevant information listed to address this bug. Then, produce a revised version of the function that resolves the issue. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support
```

The following is the buggy function that you need to fix:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)

```



## Test Functions and Error Messages Summary
The followings are test functions under directory `tests/rules/test_git_fix_stash.py` in the project.
```python
def test_not_match():
    assert not match(Command("git", stderr=git_stash_err))
```

Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:
The error message indicates that the `IndexError` occurred at line 8 of the `git_fix_stash.py` file. The function `match` in the `git_fix_stash.py` file is being called with a `command` argument. The error occurred within the `match` function at line 32 of the `git.py` file.

Looking at the specific segments of the test function code, the test function `test_not_match` is attempting to assert that the result of calling the `match` function with a specific `Command` object should be `False`.

The `Command` object passed to the `match` function is constructed with `git` as the script and the `stderr` as `git_stash_err`. The error message that indicates the `IndexError` is associated with the `match` function, and it provides the stack trace of how the error was reached.

Reviewing the `match` function code, the returned value from the function is based on checking whether the second element of the split `script` attribute of `command` is equal to `'stash'`, and if the string `'usage:'` is in the `stderr` of the `command`. This function is likely causing the `IndexError` as it is directly related to accessing the second element of the split `script` attribute of the `command`.

Therefore, to resolve the issue, it is necessary to ensure that the `command.script` attribute always contains at least two elements before attempting to access the second index position. Modifications to the splitting logic and handling the `command.script` attribute in the `match` function are likely required to address the `IndexError` issue.



## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The function "match" takes in a "command" object as input and returns a boolean value. It checks if the second word in the "command.script" is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is present in "command.stderr".

In the first buggy case, the input "command.script" has a value of 'git' and the "command.stderr" has a value of '\nusage: git stash list [<options>]\n   or: git stash show [<stash>]\n   or: git stash drop [-q'. The function then splits the "command.script" by spaces, resulting in the "splited_script" variable having a value of ['git'].

Given the rules of the function, the condition for returning True is if the second word in "command.script" is 'stash' and if the string 'usage:' is present in "command.stderr".

However, there is a bug in the function's code. The condition "(command.script.split()[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)" does not handle cases where the "command.script" has less than 2 words after splitting.

In this particular case, the condition "command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'" will result in an "IndexError" because "split" does not have a second element in the list. This will cause the function to throw an error rather than returning a boolean value.

To fix the bug, we need to check if there are at least two words after splitting "command.script" before trying to access the second word. We can modify the function code to handle this case:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_words = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_words) >= 2 
            and script_words[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This modification ensures that the condition for the second word and the presence of 'usage:' are only checked if there are at least two words in "command.script".

By making this change, the function will properly handle cases where "command.script" does not have enough words after splitting, and the buggy behavior will be resolved.



## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

The function takes in a command as input, which has attributes script, stdout, and stderr. The function then checks if the second word in the script attribute is 'stash' and if the word 'usage:' is in the stderr attribute. If both conditions are true, the function returns True.

Based on the expected return value, the function will return True for the given input values because the word 'stash' is the second word in the script attribute and the word 'usage:' is present in the stderr attribute.



## Summary of the GitHub Issue Related to the Bug

Summary:
The issue pertains to the git_fix_stash rule failing when the script is just 'git'. The error occurs due to a list index out of range, specifically when the command script is split and the second index is compared to 'stash'. This leads to an IndexError, causing the failure of the git_fix_stash rule.

Analysis:
The error is part of the 'thefuck' tool and is specific to the git_fix_stash rule. The traceback indicates that the error occurs at the 'git_fix_stash.py' file, where the command script is split and the second index is checked for 'stash'. However, when the command is just 'git', the splitting operation results in a list with only one index, leading to the IndexError when trying to access the second index.

Impact:
This bug impacts the functionality of the git_fix_stash rule, preventing it from properly handling the 'git' command. This may result in undesirable behavior or inaccurate suggestions when using the 'thefuck' tool in scenarios involving the 'git' command.

Recommendation:
The debugging process can begin by modifying the git_fix_stash rule to handle the scenario where the command consists of just 'git'. The script can be updated to include a condition that checks the length of the split command and handles the 'git' command appropriately. Additionally, thorough testing of the modified rule is crucial to ensure that it functions as expected across various command inputs.

By addressing this bug, the efficiency and effectiveness of the git_fix_stash rule within the 'thefuck' tool will be significantly enhanced, providing a more robust and reliable user experience.
