Based on the test case and the error message, it seems that the bug is occurring because the buggy function is trying to split the `command.script` without checking if it actually has any elements to split.

The bug occurs because the function blindly assumes that there will always be at least two elements after splitting `command.script`. In this case, when the `command.script` is just `'git'` without any arguments, splitting it will result in a list with just one element. Accessing the second element of this list will raise an IndexError.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if there are at least two elements in the split `command.script`. If not, then we don't need to proceed with the comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    # Split the script if it's not empty
    if command.script:
        script_parts = command.script.split()
        # Check if the split result has at least 2 elements and if the second part is 'stash'
        if len(script_parts) >= 2 and script_parts[1] == 'stash':
            return 'usage:' in command.stderr
    return False
```

This corrected function first checks if the `command.script` is not empty. If it's not empty, it splits the script and then checks if there are at least two elements and if the second part is 'stash'. Only then does it proceed with the comparison. Otherwise, it returns False. This change ensures that the function doesn't raise an IndexError when the `command.script` doesn't have the expected format.
