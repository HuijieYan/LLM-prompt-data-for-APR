The error occurs because the `command.script.split()` function is called without checking if the split result has at least two elements. In this case, when the script contains only 'git', the split result will have only one element, leading to an IndexError when trying to access index 1 of the list.

To fix this bug, we can check if the split result has at least two elements before attempting to access index 1. If not, we can return False to indicate that the command does not match.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) < 2:
        return False
    
    return (split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```
