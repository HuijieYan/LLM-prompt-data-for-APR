The bug occurs in the buggy function `match` where it tries to access the second element of the split command script without checking if it exists. This results in an IndexError when the command script is just `'git'`.

The buggy function fails to account for cases where the command script may not have an index at `[1]`. To fix this, we need to first check if the split command script has a length greater than 1 before accessing its second element.

Here's the revised version of the function that resolves the issue:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1 
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By including the check for the length of `script_parts` before accessing its second element, we prevent the IndexError from occurring when the command script is just `'git'`. This revised function should now handle the case properly and avoid the IndexError.
