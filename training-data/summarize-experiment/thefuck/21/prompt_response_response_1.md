The issue is occurring in the `match` function of the `git_fix_stash` rule. The problem is that the function is trying to access the second element of the split script, but when the input script is just 'git', it doesn't have a second element, which causes the `IndexError: list index out of range` error.

To fix this issue, we need to check if the length of the split script is at least 2 before trying to access its second element. If it's not, then we can return False, indicating that the command doesn't match the rule.

Here's the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) < 2:
        return False
    return (script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

With this modification, we first check if the length of `script_parts` is less than 2. If it is, we return False immediately, indicating that the command doesn't match the rule. Otherwise, we proceed to check if the second element of `script_parts` is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command's stderr.

This fix addresses the issue by handling the case when the input script is just 'git', avoiding the `IndexError` that was occurring previously.
