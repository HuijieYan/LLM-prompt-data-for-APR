The error is occurring in the buggy function `match` at the line `command.script.split()[1]`, which leads to a `IndexError: list index out of range` when `command.script` is just `'git'`. The function is trying to split the `command.script` by spaces and then access the second element, which is causing the error because there is only one element in the list.

To fix this bug, we can check if the length of the split command is greater than 1 before accessing the second element. If the length is not greater than 1, we can return False as it does not match the condition we are looking for.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_command = command.script.split()
    if len(split_command) > 1:
        return (split_command[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```
