The bug in the provided function is occurring due to the assumption that the command.script will contain at least two elements when split by whitespace. However, in the case of the command "git", the script will only contain one element, resulting in an IndexError when trying to access the second element.

To fix this bug, we need to check the length of the split script before accessing the second element to ensure it exists. If the length is at least 2, then we can safely check if the second element is 'stash'.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) >= 2
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

By splitting the script into parts and then checking the length before accessing the second element, we can avoid the IndexError and ensure that the function works correctly for the provided test case. This revised code can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.
