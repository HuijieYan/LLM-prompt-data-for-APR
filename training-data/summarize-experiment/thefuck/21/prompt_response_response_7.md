The bug occurs in the `match` function where it tries to access the second element of the `command.script.split()` list. The bug is caused by the assumption that there will always be a second element in the split list, which might not be the case when the script is just "git" without any additional argument.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the split list has at least two elements before accessing the second element. If it doesn't, then it means the command.script is just "git" and the function should return False.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) < 2:
        return False
    return (split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This fix addresses the issue by checking the length of the split_script list before trying to access the second element. If the length is less than 2, it means the script is just "git" and the function returns False. Otherwise, it proceeds with the original condition for matching.
