The bug in the provided function is likely to be due to the assumption that the `command.script` always contains a string that can be split into multiple elements. However, in the test case provided, the `command.script` is just 'git', which cannot be split into multiple elements as expected.

To fix this bug, the function `match` needs to be modified to handle the case when `command.script` does not contain the expected number of elements after splitting.

The corrected code for the function `match` is as follows:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_elements = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_elements) > 1 and script_elements[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This fix ensures that the `command.script` is split and checked for the presence of 'stash' in the expected position. It also checks for the presence of 'usage:' in the `command.stderr`. This should resolve the issue of the 'IndexError' being raised when attempting to access a non-existent index in the split list.

This fix will handle cases where `command.script` may not always contain multiple elements after splitting, preventing the 'IndexError' from occurring.

This corrected function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
