The bug occurs within the `match` function. The function currently attempts to split the `command.script` attribute and access the second element in the resulting list. However, it doesn't account for the case when `command.script` does not contain multiple elements after splitting, leading to an `IndexError`.

To fix this bug, we can first check if the length of the split result is greater than 1 before accessing the second element. If it's not, we can return False.

Here's the revised version of the function:

```python
from thefuck.specific.git import git_support

@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) <= 1:
        return False
    return (script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This version of the function checks if the length of `script_parts` is less than or equal to 1, returning False if it is. Otherwise, it proceeds to check if the second element is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the `command.stderr`.

This fix should resolve the `IndexError` and ensure that the function behaves as expected.
