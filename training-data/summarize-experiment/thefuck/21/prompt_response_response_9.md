The issue with the buggy function is that it is trying to access the second element of the list created by splitting the `command.script`, but in the case when the script is just `'git'`, the split list will contain only one element, leading to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element.

To fix this issue, we need to first check if the split list contains at least two elements before trying to access the second element. If not, we can return False immediately.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) < 2:
        return False

    return (split_script[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This revised function checks if the split script contains at least two elements, and if not, it returns False. Otherwise, it performs the original comparison and returns the result. This should resolve the `IndexError` issue when the script is just `'git'`.
