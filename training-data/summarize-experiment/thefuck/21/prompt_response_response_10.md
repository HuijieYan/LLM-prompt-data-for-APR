The bug occurs in the function `match` in the file `git_fix_stash.py`. The input `command.script` is split and then the second element is checked if it equals "stash". However, if the script contains only "git", then the split function returns a list with only one element, causing an IndexError.

To fix this bug, we can first check if the length of the split result is at least 2 before comparing the second element with "stash". If the length is less than 2, it means that the script does not contain "stash". We can modify the function to handle this case and return False in that scenario.

Here is the corrected code for the `match` function in `git_fix_stash.py`:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    if len(command.script.split()) < 2:
        return False
    return (command.script.split()[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This will ensure that the function does not throw an IndexError when the script contains only "git" and will return False in that case.
