The bug occurs in the `match` function due to the assumption that the `command.script` will always contain at least two elements when split by whitespace. However, in the test case provided, the `command.script` only contains one element, which causes an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element in the split list.

To fix this bug, we need to check the length of the split list before accessing the second element to ensure that it exists. If the list has at least two elements and the second element is 'stash', then we check if the 'usage:' string is present in the `command.stderr`. If both conditions are met, we return `True`, indicating a match.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) > 1 and split_script[1] == 'stash':
        return 'usage:' in command.stderr
    return False
```
