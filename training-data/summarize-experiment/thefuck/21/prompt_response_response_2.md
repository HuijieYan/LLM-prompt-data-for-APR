After analyzing the test case and the error message, it is clear that the bug is occurring in the `match` function of the `git_fix_stash` rule. The error message "IndexError: list index out of range" indicates that the `split()[1]` operation is causing the issue, as the script does not have enough elements after splitting.

The bug occurs because the current implementation assumes that the `command.script` will always have at least two elements after being split. However, in the test case provided, the `command.script` is only "git", which will result in an IndexError when attempting to access the second element of the split array.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if there are enough elements after splitting the `command.script` before attempting to access the second element. If there are not enough elements, we should return False.

Here's the revised version of the function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return (len(script_parts) > 1
            and script_parts[1] == 'stash'
            and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This revised function first splits the `command.script` and stores the resulting parts in the `script_parts` variable. Then it checks if there are enough parts after the split, and if yes, checks if the second part is 'stash' and if 'usage:' is in the command.stderr.

This should resolve the bug by handling cases where the `command.script` does not have enough elements after splitting.
