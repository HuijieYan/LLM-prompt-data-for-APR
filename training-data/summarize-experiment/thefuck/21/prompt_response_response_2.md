The bug occurs in the `match` function, specifically in the line `command.script.split()[1]`. This line tries to split the `command.script` and access the second element, assuming the script contains at least two elements. However, the test case provides a `Command` object where the script is just 'git', hence causing the `IndexError` when trying to access the second element.

To fix this bug, we can first check if the command is 'git stash' before trying to access the second element of the split script. If the command is 'git stash', then we can check if the 'usage:' is present in the `command.stderr`. 

Here's the revised version of the function that resolves the issue:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash':
        return 'usage:' in command.stderr
    return False
```
