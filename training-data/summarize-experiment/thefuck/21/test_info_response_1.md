The error message indicates that the `IndexError` occurred at line 8 of the `git_fix_stash.py` file. The function `match` in the `git_fix_stash.py` file is being called with a `command` argument. The error occurred within the `match` function at line 32 of the `git.py` file.

Looking at the specific segments of the test function code, the test function `test_not_match` is attempting to assert that the result of calling the `match` function with a specific `Command` object should be `False`.

The `Command` object passed to the `match` function is constructed with `git` as the script and the `stderr` as `git_stash_err`. The error message that indicates the `IndexError` is associated with the `match` function, and it provides the stack trace of how the error was reached.

Reviewing the `match` function code, the returned value from the function is based on checking whether the second element of the split `script` attribute of `command` is equal to `'stash'`, and if the string `'usage:'` is in the `stderr` of the `command`. This function is likely causing the `IndexError` as it is directly related to accessing the second element of the split `script` attribute of the `command`.

Therefore, to resolve the issue, it is necessary to ensure that the `command.script` attribute always contains at least two elements before attempting to access the second index position. Modifications to the splitting logic and handling the `command.script` attribute in the `match` function are likely required to address the `IndexError` issue.
