The issue in the `match` function is caused by trying to access the second element of the list returned by `command.script.split()`. However, when the input to the function is just `'git'`, this results in a list with only one element and attempting to access the second element causes an `IndexError`.

To fix this issue, we need to check the length of the list returned by `command.script.split()` before attempting to access the second element.

Here's the corrected version of the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) >= 2:
        return (script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```

In this version, we first split the `command.script` and store the result in `script_parts`. Then, we check if the length of `script_parts` is at least 2 before attempting to access the second element. If the length is at least 2, we proceed with the comparison as before. If the length is less than 2, we return `False`, indicating that the match condition is not met.

This should resolve the `IndexError` caused by the original implementation when `command.script` has only one word. The corrected function will correctly handle this scenario and prevent the error from occurring.
