The bug occurs because the buggy function `match` assumes that the `command.script` will always have more than one element after being split. However, in the test case provided, the `command.script` is simply `'git'`, which results in an `IndexError` when accessing `command.script.split()[1]`.

To fix this issue, we need to check if the length of the split `command.script` is greater than 1 before accessing the second element. If the length is less than 2, then the function should return `False`.

Here's the revised version of the function that addresses the issue:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) > 1:
        return (script_parts[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    else:
        return False
```

With this fix, the function will first check if the length of `script_parts` is greater than 1 before accessing index 1 to avoid the `IndexError` that occurred previously. This corrected code can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.
