The bug occurs in the `match` function of the `git_fix_stash` rule. The error message indicates that there is an IndexError: list index out of range, which means that the split() method is being called on an empty script, resulting in an empty list. This is likely because the script is just 'git', and when split on whitespace, it results in a list with only one element ('git'), causing the IndexError when trying to access index 1.

To fix this bug, we need to check if the script has more than one element before trying to access index 1.

Here's the corrected version of the function:
```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    if len(script_parts) > 1:
        return (script_parts[1] == 'stash'
                and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
    return False
```
This fix checks if the script has more than one part before trying to access index 1. If it does, it performs the comparison and returns the result. Otherwise, it returns False. This should resolve the IndexError issue.
