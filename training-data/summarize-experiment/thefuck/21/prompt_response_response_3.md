The error message indicates that there is an "IndexError" in the function "match" at line 8 of the file "git_fix_stash.py". This error occurs when trying to access an element of a list that does not exist, typically due to the list being empty or not having enough elements.

Looking at the buggy function, it seems that the issue occurs when trying to access the second element of the split command script when it only contains one element. This suggests that the buggy function does not handle cases where the command script has fewer elements than expected.

To fix this issue, we need to check if the split command script has at least two elements before trying to access the second element. If it has fewer than two elements, we can assume that it does not match the condition and return False.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    split_script = command.script.split()
    if len(split_script) < 2:
        return False
    return (split_script[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr)
```

This fix addresses the issue by first checking if the split command script has at least two elements. If it does not, it returns False, effectively not matching the condition. If it does have at least two elements, it proceeds with the original logic to check if it matches the expected condition.
