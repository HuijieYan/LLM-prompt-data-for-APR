The bug occurs in the `match` function, where it attempts to access the second element of the split `command.script`, which results in an IndexError when the script is just "git."

To fix this bug, we need to check whether the script starts with "git stash" instead of directly accessing the second element of the split script.

Here's the corrected function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    return command.script.startswith('git stash') and 'usage:' in command.stderr
``` 

This updated function will check if the script starts with "git stash" and if 'usage:' is present in the command's stderr, which addresses the bug. This fix ensures that the function does not attempt to access the second element of the split command.script when it doesn't exist.
