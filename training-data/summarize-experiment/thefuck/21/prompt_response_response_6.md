The error occurs in the `match` function due to an `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of the `command.script.split()` list. This error occurs because the `split` method is applied to `command.script` without checking if it contains more than one element.

To fix this bug, we need to first check if the `command.script.split()` list contains more than one element before trying to access the second element.

Here's the corrected code for the `match` function:

```python
@git_support
def match(command):
    script_parts = command.script.split()
    return len(script_parts) > 1 and script_parts[1] == 'stash' and 'usage:' in command.stderr
```

With this correction, we first check if the `script_parts` list has more than one element before checking if the second element is `'stash'`. This will prevent the `IndexError` from occurring.
