Based on the provided code and the expected return values for the test cases, it is observed that the function `astype_nansafe` is designed to cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner. 

The function takes four input parameters:
1. `arr` - An ndarray containing elements to be cast to the specified dtype.
2. `dtype` - The target numpy data type to which the elements should be cast.
3. `copy` - A boolean flag indicating whether a copy of the array should be made.
4. `skipna` - A boolean flag indicating whether NaN values should be skipped when casting as a string-type.

The function proceeds to handle different data type and dtype combinations by applying specific rules for each case. It evaluates the `dtype` and `arr` to determine the appropriate action for the conversion.

For example, if the `dtype` is an extension array dtype, the function calls on the extension dtype to construct the array type and then returns the constructed array type from the sequence with the specified dtype.

Furthermore, it handles specific dtype cases such as string types, datetime64/timedelta64 types, floating to integer conversions, and object types like datetime and timedelta. In each case, specific rules are applied to safely convert the array elements.

Based on the expected variable values and types before the function returns, it is clear that the function effectively handles the conversion of datatypes and dtype combinations to match the expected output.

Overall, the function contains complex logic to handle various data type and dtype combinations, including nan-safe handling, and makes use of NumPy and Pandas functionality to fulfill the conversion requirements.
