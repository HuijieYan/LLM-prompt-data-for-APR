Based on the analysis of the function and the given test cases, it appears that the core logic of the function involves casting the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

The function checks the dtype and the array type to determine the appropriate actions. It checks if the dtype is an extension array dtype and constructs the array type if needed. If the dtype is a string type, it uses a library function to cast the array elements to strings. If the array type is datetime64 or timedelta64, it performs conversions based on the dtype and arr.dtype. It also handles cases where the array and dtype are of floating point or object types.

In both test cases, the logic is centered around checking the dtype, arr.dtype, and the type of the array elements to perform the appropriate type conversions using the numpy and pandas libraries.

Based on the expected variables before function return, it can be observed that the function manipulates the dtype and its attributes such as dtype.type, dtype.kind, and dtype.name to determine the appropriate casting action.

Overall, the function contains multiple conditional statements to handle different data types and perform type conversions with nan-safe handling, ensuring that the elements of the array are cast to the given dtype appropriately.
