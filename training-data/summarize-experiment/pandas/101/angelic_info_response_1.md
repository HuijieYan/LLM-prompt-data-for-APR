Based on the provided source code and expected return values for different test cases, the core logic of the `astype_nansafe` function can be summarized as follows:

1. The function first checks if the provided `dtype` is an extension dtype. If it is, it constructs the array type using the specified `dtype` and returns the result.

2. If the `dtype` is not an extension dtype, the function ensures that it is an instance of `np.dtype` and then checks for different scenarios based on the data type of the input array `arr`.

3. If the `dtype` is a string type, it uses a library function to cast the elements of the input array to the specified `dtype` and then reshapes the array.

4. If the input array `arr` is of datetime64 type, the function performs various checks and conversions based on the specified `dtype`, and raises appropriate errors or type errors if necessary.

5. Similarly, if the input array `arr` is of timedelta64 type, the function handles different scenarios based on the specified `dtype`, performs conversions, and raises errors as needed.

6. If the input array `arr` is of float type and the specified `dtype` is an integer type, the function checks for non-finite values and raises a value error if they are present.

7. If the input array `arr` is of object type, the function handles conversions for integer, datetime, and timedelta types based on the specified `dtype`.

8. Finally, if none of the above conditions are met, the function performs an explicit copy if required, or directly returns the input array casted to the specified `dtype`.

Based on the input parameter values and expected variable values for each test case, the function's core logic and behavior have been analyzed comprehensively to understand its behavior and output.
