Based on the test case and the error message, it is evident that the bug is occurring when attempting to cast a Categorical or CategoricalIndex containing NaNs to an integer dtype. The function `astype_nansafe` is failing to handle NaN values correctly when casting to an integer dtype, resulting in unexpected behavior and the generation of incorrect integer values.

The bug is likely occurring in the section of the function that handles the conversion of NaN values to integer types. The logic for handling NaN values and their conversion to integers needs to be reviewed and corrected.

The main reason behind the bug is the mishandling of NaN values when converting to integer types. This results in the generation of incorrect integer values, as observed in the test case.

To fix the bug, the function `astype_nansafe` needs to be modified to correctly handle NaN values when casting to integer dtypes. This may involve adding specific checks for NaN values and implementing appropriate conversion behavior for these cases.

Here's the revised version of the `astype_nansafe` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged) ...

    if np.issubdtype(arr.dtype, np.floating) and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        if not np.isfinite(arr).all():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert non-finite values (NA or inf) to integer")
        arr_non_nan = arr.copy()
        arr_non_nan[np.isnan(arr)] = 0  # Replace NaN values with 0
        return arr_non_nan.astype(dtype, copy=copy)

    elif is_object_dtype(arr):
        # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged) ...

    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged) ...
```

In the revised function, the block handling the conversion of NaN values to integers has been updated to replace NaN values with 0 before performing the type conversion. This approach ensures that NaN values are appropriately handled when casting to integer types, preventing the generation of incorrect integer values.

This revised function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version to resolve the issue.
