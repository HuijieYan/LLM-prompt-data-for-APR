From the error message, the key information that we note is an indication that the function `astype_nansafe` should raise a ValueError, but it failed to do so. This implies that there's a bug in the `astype_nansafe` function. The issue is specifically arisen from a certain combination of the `val` and `typ` parameters. Consequently, the bug needs to be identified and rectified. Additionally, it is important to note that the error message supplies a helpful hint regarding the expectation of what the error should be, which is a ValueError with the message "Cannot convert NaT values to integer".

Conversely, the relevant parts of the test function includes the initialization of the input, `arr`, and the expected error message. In this instance, the creation of `arr` involves a single value `val`, which is passed as the input parameter to the `astype_nansafe` function. The expectation is that calling `astype_nansafe` should raise a ValueError with the message "Cannot convert NaT values to integer". 

Based on the test function's input and expected output, the bug most likely arises from the erroneous handling of `NaT` values when converting to integer, as evident from the error message of "Cannot convert NaT values to integer". This points toward a discrepancy in the code's logic when dealing with NaT values, which is critical for the integrity of the function. The inspection of the given segments from both the test function and the error message allows us to conclude that the main issue is associated with handling `NaT` values when casting to integers, and the finding directs us to focus our corrective measures within the specific portion of the `astype_nansafe` function that is responsible for handling `NaT` values and casting them to integer types. A careful review and debugging of the relevant code is required to resolve the issue at hand.
