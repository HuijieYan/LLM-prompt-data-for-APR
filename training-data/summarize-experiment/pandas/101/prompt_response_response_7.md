Based on the test case and error message, it seems that the bug is related to the function's handling of `NaT` values when converting to integer. The error message "Cannot convert NaT values to integer" indicates that the function should raise a ValueError, but it fails to do so.

Upon examining the code, it is likely that the issue arises from the logic within the condition where the dtype is checked for datetime64 or timedelta64. The function should appropriately handle the conversion of `NaT` values to integers, but it seems to be encountering an issue in this specific code segment.

The bug likely occurs because the function does not have specific handling for converting `NaT` values to integer when the dtype is datetime64 or timedelta64. As a result, the function fails to raise an appropriate ValueError when attempting to convert `NaT` to integer.

To fix the bug, the function should include specific handling for `NaT` values when converting to integer for datetime64 and timedelta64 dtypes. This could involve checking for `NaT` values and appropriately raising a ValueError with a clear error message when encountered.

Here's the corrected function to address the bug:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype in a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
        Cannot convert NaN values to integer (newly added for bug fix).
    """

    # (existing code here...)

    if is_datetime64_dtype(arr) or is_timedelta64_dtype(arr):
        if isna(arr).any():
            raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaN values to integer")

        # rest of the existing code for datetime64 and timedelta64 dtype handling...
    
    # (remaining existing code here...)
```

In the corrected code, specific handling for `NaT` values has been added within the condition for datetime64 and timedelta64 dtype. If `NaT` values are found in the array, the function raises a ValueError with the message "Cannot convert NaN values to integer", addressing the bug and fulfilling the expected behavior. The rest of the function's logic remains unchanged.
