Please correct the malfunctioning function provided below by using the relevant information listed to address this bug. Then, produce a revised version of the function that resolves the issue. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
import weakref
from pandas.util._decorators import Appender, cache_readonly, doc
```

The following is the buggy function that you need to fix:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))

```

## Test Functions and Error Messages Summary
The followings are test functions under directory `pandas/tests/indexes/multi/test_get_level_values.py` in the project.
```python
def test_get_level_values_when_periods():
    # GH33131. See also discussion in GH32669.
    # This test can probably be removed when PeriodIndex._engine is removed.
    from pandas import Period, PeriodIndex

    idx = MultiIndex.from_arrays(
        [PeriodIndex([Period("2019Q1"), Period("2019Q2")], name="b")]
    )
    idx2 = MultiIndex.from_arrays(
        [idx._get_level_values(level) for level in range(idx.nlevels)]
    )
    assert all(x.is_monotonic for x in idx2.levels)
```

Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:
The test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is attempting to test functionality related to `PeriodIndex` and the implementation of the `_engine` function within the `MultiIndex` class. 

The `MultiIndex` class has a method called `_get_level_values`. This method is utilized in the test function to create a new `MultiIndex` called `idx2` based on the `PeriodIndex` `idx`. The `idx._get_level_values` method is used in a list comprehension to populate `idx2` with level values for each level within the `MultiIndex`.

The error message indicates that the line `assert all(x.is_monotonic for x in idx2.levels)` is causing an exception during execution. The specific error being raised is an `AttributeError` with the message `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`. This error occurs within the internals of the pandas library and seems to be related to the usage of a method or attribute that does not exist.

In order to diagnose and resolve this issue, it is necessary to review the implementation of the `_engine` function within the `MultiIndex` class. Specifically, the snippet of code within the `_engine` function is trying to create an instance of `self._engine_type` and returning the result. The error message originates from the attribute access in the is_monotonic_increasing method, which is likely related to the instantiation of the engine.

Upon inspection of the `_engine` function, it is evident that `period` is being assigned the value of `weakref.ref(self)`. This `weakref` is then being used to instantiate `self._engine_type` and returning the result. It is crucial to thoroughly analyze the implementation of `self._engine_type` for any potential flaws that might lead to the encountered AttributeError.

In conclusion, the error in the `test_get_level_values_when_periods` function seems to be caused by a flaw or omission in the implementation of the `_engine` method within the `MultiIndex` class. A more in-depth examination of the `_engine` method, particularly the creation of the `self._engine_type` instance, is required to further diagnose and fix the issue.



## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

Given the code for the buggy function and the variable runtime values and types inside the function for Buggy case 1, let's analyze how the inputs and output are related.

1. The input `self._values` is a `PeriodArray` containing the periods '2019Q1' and '2019Q2'.
2. The input `self` is a `PeriodIndex` containing the same periods '2019Q1' and '2019Q2'.
3. The input `self._engine_type` is a class object of type `pandas._libs.index.PeriodEngine`.

The function returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, which means it passes a weak reference of `self` and the length of `self` to `_engine_type`.

Given that the inputs are related to time periods ('2019Q1', '2019Q2') and the function call includes passing the length of `self`, it's likely that the purpose of this function is to create an instance of the `PeriodEngine` class to work with time periods.

To identify the bug, we need to consider the specific behavior of the `PeriodEngine` class and how it interacts with the inputs provided. We also need to verify that the weak reference `period` is being used correctly within the `_engine_type` class instantiation.

Further examination of the `PeriodEngine` class and its expected behavior may reveal where the bug lies and why the test cases are failing. Additionally, checking for any side effects caused by the use of weak references and the length of `self` in the context of the `_engine_type` instantiation could help in identifying the source of the issue.



## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

## Summary
The function `_engine` is a cached read-only function that takes in the input parameters `self` and `self._engine_type`. It creates a weak reference to the `self` parameter and then returns the result of calling `self._engine_type` with the weak reference `period` and the length of `self` as its arguments. The expected return value in tests indicates that the function is expected to create an instance of `self._engine_type` with the weak reference `period` and the length of `self` as its arguments and return this instance.



## Summary of the GitHub Issue Related to the Bug

Summary:

The bug reported on GitHub is related to a problem with copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex, which results in the loss of weak references. When attempting to check if all levels in the copied MultiIndex are monotonic, an error is raised due to the weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped before intended, causing the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex. The expected output should be True, but due to the bug, it does not return the expected result. This issue requires debugging to identify and resolve the problem with copying PeriodIndex levels on MultiIndex.
