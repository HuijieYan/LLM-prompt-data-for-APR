The error appears to be occurring in the `is_monotonic_increasing` method of the `PeriodEngine` class within the `pandas._libs.index` module. The error message indicates that a `NoneType` object is being accessed for the `view` attribute, which means that the `_get_index_values` method is returning `None` instead of the expected index values.

The buggy function `_engine` is returning a weak reference to `self` in the line `period = weakref.ref(self)`, but it should actually be creating a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object that is being passed to the `PeriodEngine` constructor. This is causing the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` to be dropped prematurely, leading to a `NoneType` error when accessing the index values.

To fix this bug, the `_engine` function should create a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object that is being passed to the `PeriodEngine` constructor, instead of a weak reference to `self`. This will ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is not dropped prematurely.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of the PeriodIndex to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)  # should be weakref.ref(self._values) instead of weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By making this change, the weak reference will now be created for the `PeriodIndex` object, ensuring that it is not dropped prematurely and resolving the `NoneType` error in the `is_monotonic_increasing` method of the `PeriodEngine` class.
