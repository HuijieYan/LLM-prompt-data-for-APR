The error is occurring at `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))` in the `_engine()` function. It seems that the weak reference `period` is being assigned incorrectly. The weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is getting dropped before it should, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this issue, we need to correctly use the weak reference for the `PeriodIndex` and ensure that it is not dropped prematurely.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine()` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

By passing `self` directly to `_engine_type` instead of using a weak reference, we ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives the correct reference to the `PeriodIndex` object. This should fix the issue of the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` getting dropped prematurely.

Please replace the original `_engine()` function with this corrected code to resolve the issue.
