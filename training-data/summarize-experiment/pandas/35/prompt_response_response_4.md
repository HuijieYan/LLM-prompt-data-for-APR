```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```


By analyzing the function and the provided information, it appears that the bug is likely located in the `_engine` function, specifically within the line `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. The use of the `weakref` appears to be correct, but the issue may be related to how it is being passed to `self._engine_type`.

The bug likely occurs due to the weak reference `period` being used in the instantiation of `self._engine_type`, but not correctly retrieving the referenced object when needed. This results in the unexpected AttributeError during execution.

To fix the bug, the instantiation of `self._engine_type` should correctly retrieve the referenced object from the weak reference `period` and use it in the engine instance creation.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)()
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

In the corrected code, `period = weakref.ref(self)()` ensures that the weak reference is dereferenced and the referenced object is passed to `self._engine_type`. This should resolve the issue with the weak reference and prevent the AttributeError from occurring. The corrected function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
