Based on the error message and the test case, the issue seems to be related to weak referencing. The error occurs when the `_do_monotonic_check` method attempts to access the `PeriodEngine` class, but receives a `NoneType` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

The issue is likely occurring in the `_engine` method, where the weak reference is not correctly preserving the reference to the `PeriodIndex` object. This results in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the actual `PeriodIndex` object.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the weak reference is created and used properly within the `_engine` method to avoid losing the reference to the `PeriodIndex` object.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Create a weak reference to self.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    # Use the weak reference to access the PeriodIndex object.
    period_index = period()
    # Check if the weak reference is still valid.
    if period_index is not None:
        # Use the weakly referenced PeriodIndex object to create the PeriodEngine.
        return self._engine_type(period_index, len(self))
    else:
        # Handle the case where the weak reference is no longer valid.
        raise ValueError("Weak reference to PeriodIndex is no longer valid.")
```
By using the weak reference properly within the `_engine` method, we ensure that the reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is preserved and accessible to the `PeriodEngine`. This should resolve the issue of losing the weak reference and prevent the `NoneType` error from occurring.

Please replace the existing `_engine` method with the corrected code provided above to fix the bug.
