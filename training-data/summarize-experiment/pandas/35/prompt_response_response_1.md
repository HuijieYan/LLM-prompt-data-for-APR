Based on the error message and the test case, it seems that the `PeriodEngine` is receiving a `NoneType` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`. This is likely due to a reference issue with the weakref, causing the `PeriodIndex` to be dropped before intended.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained until the `PeriodEngine` has finished using it.

We can achieve this by storing the weak reference to `self` outside the method and using it when calling `_engine_type`. This will prevent the weak reference from being dropped prematurely.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Retain a weak reference to self
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By storing and using the weak reference in this way, we ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives a valid reference to `self` and the bug is resolved.
