```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```


Corrected Code:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self, len(self))
```

Explanation:
The bug occurs in the original function `_engine` where the weak reference `period` is being passed to `self._engine_type` instead of the actual `self` object. This results in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a weak reference instead of the expected `PeriodIndex` object, leading to the AttributeError when the engine attempts to access the weak reference.

The corrected code updates the return statement to pass the actual `self` object to `self._engine_type` instead of the weak reference `period`. This resolves the issue of weak references being used where they should not be, and the function will now appropriately create an instance of `self._engine_type` with the correct parameters.

This correction will ensure that the engine receives the expected input and can perform its operations without encountering the AttributeError, resolving the bug related to the weak reference issue.

The corrected code can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.
