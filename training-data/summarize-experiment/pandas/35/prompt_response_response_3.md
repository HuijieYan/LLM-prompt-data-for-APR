The issue in the provided _engine function is related to the weak reference being used with self when calling self._engine_type. As the bug suggests, the weak reference is not being preserved and is being dropped before the expected time, causing the Period Engine to receive a None instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the weak reference 'period' is preserved until the call to self._engine_type is completed. One approach to address this could be to store the weak reference 'period' in a variable before calling self._engine_type. This ensures that the weak reference is not lost during the execution of the function.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    period_ref = period  # Store the weak reference in a variable
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, len(self))  # Use the stored weak reference in the _engine_type instantiation
```
