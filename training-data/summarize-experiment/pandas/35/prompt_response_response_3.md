The error is occurring in the function `_engine` of the `PeriodIndex` class. The function is supposed to create a weak reference of the `self` object and pass it to `_engine_type` to prevent a reference cycle. However, the weak reference is not being handled correctly, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this issue, we need to properly handle the weak reference and ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives the correct reference to the `self` object.

Here is the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

By calling `period()` we convert the weak reference to an actual reference of the `self` object, which can then be passed to `_engine_type` as intended.

This corrected function should address the issue of weakrefs being lost and resolve the AttributeError in the test case.
