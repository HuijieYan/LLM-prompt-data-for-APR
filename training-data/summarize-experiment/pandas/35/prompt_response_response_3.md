The potential error location within the problematic function is the usage of weak references. The weakly referenced PeriodIndex is getting dropped before intended, which results in the PeriodEngine receiving a `None` instead of the PeriodIndex.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to use a strong reference instead of a weak reference. This will ensure that the PeriodIndex object is not dropped prematurely and the PeriodEngine receives the intended reference.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Use a strong reference instead of weak reference
    period = self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using a strong reference, we address the issue of the weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped prematurely. This fix should resolve the bug and ensure that the PeriodEngine receives the intended reference.
