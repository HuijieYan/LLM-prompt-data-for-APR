Given the code for the buggy function and the variable runtime values and types inside the function for Buggy case 1, let's analyze how the inputs and output are related.

1. The input `self._values` is a `PeriodArray` containing the periods '2019Q1' and '2019Q2'.
2. The input `self` is a `PeriodIndex` containing the same periods '2019Q1' and '2019Q2'.
3. The input `self._engine_type` is a class object of type `pandas._libs.index.PeriodEngine`.

The function returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, which means it passes a weak reference of `self` and the length of `self` to `_engine_type`.

Given that the inputs are related to time periods ('2019Q1', '2019Q2') and the function call includes passing the length of `self`, it's likely that the purpose of this function is to create an instance of the `PeriodEngine` class to work with time periods.

To identify the bug, we need to consider the specific behavior of the `PeriodEngine` class and how it interacts with the inputs provided. We also need to verify that the weak reference `period` is being used correctly within the `_engine_type` class instantiation.

Further examination of the `PeriodEngine` class and its expected behavior may reveal where the bug lies and why the test cases are failing. Additionally, checking for any side effects caused by the use of weak references and the length of `self` in the context of the `_engine_type` instantiation could help in identifying the source of the issue.
