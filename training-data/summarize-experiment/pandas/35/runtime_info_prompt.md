You're provided with the source code of a buggy function, along with the values of variables captured during its execution. Imagine you're in the middle of debugging, where you've got logs of both the input and output variables' values. These logs come from test cases that didn't pass, showing the types and values of the input parameters as well as the values and types of key variables at the moment the function returns. If an input parameter's value isn't mentioned in the output, you can assume it stayed the same throughout the function's execution. However, be aware that some of these output values may be incorrect.

Your mission is to dive deep into these details, linking the observed variable values with the function's code. By closely examining and referencing specific parts of the buggy code and the variable logs, you'll need to piece together a clear, detailed narrative.

We're looking for a thorough and insightful exploration.

The following is the buggy function code:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))

```

# Variable runtime value and type inside buggy function
## Buggy case 1
### input parameter runtime value and type for buggy function
self._values, value: `<PeriodArray>
['2019Q1', '2019Q2']
Length: 2, dtype: period[Q-DEC]`, type: `PeriodArray`

self, value: `PeriodIndex(['2019Q1', '2019Q2'], dtype='period[Q-DEC]', freq='Q-DEC')`, type: `PeriodIndex`

self._engine_type, value: `<class 'pandas._libs.index.PeriodEngine'>`, type: `type`
