The problematic function `_engine` is a cached read-only function that takes in the input parameters `self` and `self._engine_type`. It creates a weak reference to the `self` parameter and then returns the result of calling `self._engine_type` with the weak reference `period` and the length of `self` as its arguments.

The error message in the test case indicates that the line `assert all(x.is_monotonic for x in idx2.levels)` is causing an `AttributeError` with the message `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`. This suggests that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is being dropped prematurely, resulting in unexpected behavior when checking for monotonicity.

The bug is likely located in the instantiation of `self._engine_type` within the `_engine` function. The weak reference `period` may be losing its reference before it is used within `self._engine_type`, resulting in the unexpected `NoneType` object.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `_engine` function to ensure that the weak reference `period` is maintained until after its usage within the instantiation of `self._engine_type`.

Here is the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(lambda: period, len(self))
```

In the corrected code, the `lambda: period` ensures that the weak reference `period` is maintained until it is used within the instantiation of `self._engine_type`. This should address the premature dropping of the weak reference and resolve the bug.
