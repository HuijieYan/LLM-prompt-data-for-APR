The error occurs because the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object gets dropped before it is intended to, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_engine` function to maintain the weak reference to the `self` object and ensure that it is not dropped prematurely. We can achieve this by storing the weak reference to `self` as an attribute of the `_engine` function to prevent it from being dropped.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Maintain a weak reference to self as an attribute of the function
    if not hasattr(self, '_weakref_period'):
        self._weakref_period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._weakref_period, len(self._values))
```

By storing the weak reference to `self` as an attribute of the `_engine` function, we ensure that the reference is not dropped prematurely, resolving the issue with the weak reference being lost. This corrected version of the function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
