The error message indicates that the PeriodEngine is receiving a None type instead of the expected PeriodIndex, which is causing the AttributeError when trying to access the 'view' attribute. 

The issue seems to be related to the weak reference handling. When the PeriodIndex is weakly referenced, it's being dropped before it should be. This causes the PeriodEngine to receive a None instead of the expected PeriodIndex.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the PeriodIndex is maintained until it's no longer needed by the PeriodEngine. 

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    self._engine = weakref.ref(engine)  # Store the weak reference in _engine attribute
    return engine
```

By storing the weak reference to the engine in the `_engine` attribute, we ensure that the PeriodIndex is not dropped prematurely, and it remains accessible to the PeriodEngine when needed.

This fix should address the weak reference handling issue and resolve the AttributeError.
