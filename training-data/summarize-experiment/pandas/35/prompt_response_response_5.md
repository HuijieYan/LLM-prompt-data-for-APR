The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError because the `PeriodEngine` is receiving a `NoneType` object instead of a `PeriodIndex`. This is likely occurring within the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class.

The bug occurs because the `weakref.ref` being assigned to `period` does not retain a reference to the `self` object, resulting in the `NoneType` being passed to `_engine_type`.

To fix this bug, you can modify the `_engine` method to ensure that a strong reference to `self` is maintained within the weak reference. This can be done by directly passing `self` to the weak reference.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Ensure a strong reference to self is maintained within the weak reference
    period = weakref.ref(self, lambda _: None)  # maintain a strong reference to self
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By maintaining a strong reference to `self` within the weak reference, we ensure that the `PeriodEngine` does not receive a `NoneType` object. This should resolve the AttributeError in the test case.
