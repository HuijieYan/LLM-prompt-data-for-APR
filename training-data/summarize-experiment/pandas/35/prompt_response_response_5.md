The error seems to be present in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. 

The bug seems to be caused by the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` being dropped before intended, resulting in the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` is maintained until after it's used in the `PeriodEngine`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

With this correction, we're maintaining a weak reference to `self` until it's used in creating the `PeriodEngine`, ensuring that it is not dropped prematurely.
