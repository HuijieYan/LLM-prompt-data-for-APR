The provided buggy function is attempting to create an instance of `self._engine_type` using a weak reference to `self` and the length of `self` as arguments. This may lead to unexpected behavior due to the use of weak references and the potential loss of reference before the intended usage.

A potential approach to fixing the bug is to ensure that the weak reference is used correctly and that the `self._engine_type` class instantiation receives the expected input without any loss of reference.

Here's the revised version of the function that addresses the bug:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    length = len(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref, length)
```
