The test function `test_get_level_values_when_periods` is attempting to test functionality related to `PeriodIndex` and the implementation of the `_engine` function within the `MultiIndex` class. 

The `MultiIndex` class has a method called `_get_level_values`. This method is utilized in the test function to create a new `MultiIndex` called `idx2` based on the `PeriodIndex` `idx`. The `idx._get_level_values` method is used in a list comprehension to populate `idx2` with level values for each level within the `MultiIndex`.

The error message indicates that the line `assert all(x.is_monotonic for x in idx2.levels)` is causing an exception during execution. The specific error being raised is an `AttributeError` with the message `'NoneType' object has no attribute 'view'`. This error occurs within the internals of the pandas library and seems to be related to the usage of a method or attribute that does not exist.

In order to diagnose and resolve this issue, it is necessary to review the implementation of the `_engine` function within the `MultiIndex` class. Specifically, the snippet of code within the `_engine` function is trying to create an instance of `self._engine_type` and returning the result. The error message originates from the attribute access in the is_monotonic_increasing method, which is likely related to the instantiation of the engine.

Upon inspection of the `_engine` function, it is evident that `period` is being assigned the value of `weakref.ref(self)`. This `weakref` is then being used to instantiate `self._engine_type` and returning the result. It is crucial to thoroughly analyze the implementation of `self._engine_type` for any potential flaws that might lead to the encountered AttributeError.

In conclusion, the error in the `test_get_level_values_when_periods` function seems to be caused by a flaw or omission in the implementation of the `_engine` method within the `MultiIndex` class. A more in-depth examination of the `_engine` method, particularly the creation of the `self._engine_type` instance, is required to further diagnose and fix the issue.
