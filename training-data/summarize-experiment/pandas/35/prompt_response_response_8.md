The error occurs when the `_engine` function is called on a `PeriodIndex` object. It seems that the weak reference to self is not being retained properly, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the weak reference to self is retained properly and not dropped prematurely. One way to achieve this is to store the weak reference in a separate variable to ensure its retention until it is needed.

Here's the revised version of the function that resolves the issue:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period_weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_weakref, len(self))
```
