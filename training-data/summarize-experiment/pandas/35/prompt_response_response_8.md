The issue with the `_engine` function is that it is creating a weak reference to `self` and passing it directly to `self._engine_type` without using the weak reference to access the original object. This results in the weak reference being lost before the intended use, causing unexpected behavior in the `self._engine_type` instantiation.

To fix this issue, the function should use the weak reference to access the original object and then pass it to `self._engine_type`. This will ensure that the weak reference is not lost prematurely, resolving the issue with the weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped before intended.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In this revised version, the weak reference `period` is called to access the original object before being passed to `self._engine_type`. This ensures that the weak reference is properly utilized and the issue with the weakly referenced PeriodIndex being dropped prematurely is resolved. This corrected code can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.
