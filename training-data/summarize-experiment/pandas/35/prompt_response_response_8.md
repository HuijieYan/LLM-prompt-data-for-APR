The error occurs when the `_engine` function is called, and it seems to be related to weak references not being handled correctly, leading to the `PeriodEngine` getting a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is maintained properly so that it can be used in the `_engine_type` initialization. We should also make sure that the `self._engine_type` function is called correctly with the appropriate arguments.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```

In the corrected code, we are using `len(self._values)` instead of `len(self)` as the length of the `PeriodArray`, and we are maintaining a weak reference to `self` to avoid a reference cycle.

This should resolve the issue by ensuring that the weak reference is maintained correctly and used in the `_engine_type` initialization.
