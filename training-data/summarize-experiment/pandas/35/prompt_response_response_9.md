Based on the provided information and analysis, the bug likely occurs in the `_engine` function within the `PeriodIndex` class. The `weakref` being used to create a reference to `self` is not being handled properly, leading to the weak reference being dropped prematurely. This results in the `PeriodEngine` receiving a `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`, causing the AttributeError during execution.

To fix the bug, the handling of the weak reference `period` and its usage in the instantiation of `self._engine_type` needs to be revised to ensure that the weak reference is maintained until it is no longer needed.

Here is the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period(), len(self))
```

In the revised code, `period` is called as a function `period()` to obtain the original reference, and this reference is passed to `_engine_type`. This ensures that the weak reference is accessed properly and prevents the premature dropping of the reference.

By implementing this fix, the `_engine` function should correctly create an instance of `self._engine_type` with the weak reference `period` and the length of `self` as its arguments, resolving the bug reported on GitHub.
