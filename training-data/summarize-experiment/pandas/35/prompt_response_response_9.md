The bug is occurring in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The function returns `self._engine_type(period, len(self))`, which then calls for the `PeriodEngine` to check if the index is monotonic increasing. However, this process fails with an AttributeError due to a `NoneType` object having no attribute 'view'.

The reason for this bug is that the weakly referenced PeriodIndex is being dropped prematurely, causing the `PeriodEngine` to receive a `None` instead of the intended `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `self` object is maintained until after it is used by the `_engine_type` constructor.

Here's the revised version of the function that resolves the issue by using a weakly referenced `period` object and ensuring that it is maintained until after it is used by the `_engine_type` constructor:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    engine_type = self._engine_type(period, len(self))
    return engine_type

```
