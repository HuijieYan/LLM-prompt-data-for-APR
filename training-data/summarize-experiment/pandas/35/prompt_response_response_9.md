The error occurs in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class. The function attempts to create a weak reference to `self` using `weakref.ref(self)`, but then it uses `self` to create an instance of `_engine_type`. This leads to a reference cycle and the weak reference is not maintained, resulting in the error.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to `self` is properly maintained when creating the engine type instance.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._data))
```

In the corrected code, we use `len(self._data)` instead of `len(self)` to prevent accessing `self` directly and breaking the weak reference. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the weak reference is maintained as intended.
