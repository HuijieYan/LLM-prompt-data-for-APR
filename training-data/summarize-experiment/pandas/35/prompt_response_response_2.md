The bug in the `_engine` function appears to be related to the creation of a weak reference `period` and its usage in instantiating `self._engine_type`. The weak reference is being used, but it seems that it is not being handled properly within the context of the `_engine_type` instantiation, which results in the error encountered during the test case execution. 

To address this issue, it is important to ensure that the weak reference `period` is being used correctly and safely within the instantiation of `self._engine_type`. It may be necessary to review the implementation of `self._engine_type` for any potential flaws that could lead to the encountered AttributeError in the test case.

A potential approach to fixing this bug could involve modifying the creation and usage of the weak reference `period` within the `_engine` function. Additionally, a careful review and potential modification of the instantiation of `self._engine_type` with respect to handling weak references could be necessary.

Here is the corrected code for the `_engine` function which inlines the `cache_readonly` decorator:

```python
def _engine(self):
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

This simplified version of the function should resolve the bug by correctly creating a weak reference to `self` and using it to instantiate `self._engine_type` with the length of `self` as its argument. If the bug is related to the incorrect usage of the weak reference within `self._engine_type`, further examination and potential modification of `self._engine_type` may be necessary to fully address the issue.
