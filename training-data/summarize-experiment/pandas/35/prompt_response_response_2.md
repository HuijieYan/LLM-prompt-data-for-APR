The error occurs in the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class. This method is supposed to return an instance of the `_engine_type` class with a weak reference to the `self` object, but it seems that the weak reference is not being properly handled, leading to a `NoneType` error when trying to access the weakly referenced object.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `self` object is maintained properly. We can use the `weakref.proxy` function to create a weak reference to the `self` object and pass it to the `_engine_type` constructor.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` method:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(weakref.proxy(self), len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy(self)` instead of `weakref.ref(self)`, we ensure that a valid reference to the `self` object is passed to the `_engine_type` constructor, preventing the `NoneType` error.

By implementing this change, we can resolve the bug and ensure that the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` is not dropped prematurely, leading to the expected output in the test case.
