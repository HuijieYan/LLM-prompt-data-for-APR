The error occurs when the `is_monotonic` property is accessed for the `PeriodIndex` levels in the `test_get_level_values_when_periods` test. The error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` is receiving a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`, leading to the `AttributeError`.

The bug is likely in the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class, where a weak reference to `self` is used to avoid a reference cycle when passing it to `_engine_type`. However, the weak reference implementation seems to be incorrect, resulting in `None` being passed to `_engine_type`.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly implement the weak reference and ensure that the `PeriodIndex` is passed as expected to the `_engine_type`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function of the `PeriodIndex` class:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.proxy(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self))
```

By using `weakref.proxy` instead of `weakref.ref`, we will create a weak reference proxy object to `self`. This proxy object behaves like a normal reference when passed to functions and methods but allows the original object to be garbage collected if there are no other references to it. This should resolve the issue of passing `None` to `_engine_type` and fix the bug.
