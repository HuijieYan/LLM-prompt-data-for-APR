The error occurs when the function `is_monotonic_increasing` is called on the `PeriodIndex` object, but the `PeriodEngine` is receiving a `NoneType` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this issue, we need to modify the `_engine` function in `PeriodIndex` class to correctly return the `self._engine_type` using a weak reference.

The buggy `@cache_readonly` function `_engine` should be fixed as follows:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self)) if self._engine_type else None
```

This change ensures that if `self._engine_type` is `None`, then the function will return `None` as the result.

The revised function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.
