Potential Bug Location:

The potential bug location is within the `_engine` method of the `PeriodIndex` class, specifically in the line `return self._engine_type(period, len(self))`. The use of the weak reference `period` and the length of `self` as arguments for `self._engine_type` instantiation might be causing unexpected behavior.

Reasons Behind the Bug:

The bug is likely caused by how the weak reference `period` is being used in the instantiation of `self._engine_type`. The weak reference may not be maintained long enough for the `self._engine_type` to use it effectively, causing it to be garbage collected prematurely.

Additionally, the length of `self` being passed to `self._engine_type` might not be appropriate for the instantiation of the `PeriodEngine`, leading to unexpected behavior.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:

1. Ensure that the weak reference `period` is maintained for the duration of its use in the `self._engine_type` instantiation.
2. Validate whether passing the length of `self` to `self._engine_type` is necessary and appropriate for creating an instance of `PeriodEngine`.
3. Consider alternative approaches for instantiating `PeriodEngine` that do not rely on weak references and the length of `self`.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, pass a weakref of self to _engine_type.
    period = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period, self)
```

In the corrected code, the use of `len(self)` as an argument has been replaced with the reference `self` itself, which removes the need to pass the length of `self`. This change aims to address the potential issue related to passing the length of `self` to `self._engine_type` and simplifies the arguments passed for instantiation.
