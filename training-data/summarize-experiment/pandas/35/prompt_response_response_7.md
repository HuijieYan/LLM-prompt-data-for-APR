The bug occurs in the `_engine` function, which is accessed through the `PeriodEngine` class. The error message suggests that the `self._do_monotonic_check()` call inside the `_engine` function returns a `NoneType` object, leading to an AttributeError. This implies that the `self._values` object is not being weakly referenced as intended, causing it to be dropped before it should.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weakly referenced `self._values` object is preserved until it is no longer needed. This can be achieved by modifying the `_engine` function to properly use weak referencing.

Here's the corrected version of the `_engine` function that addresses the bug:
```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Weakly reference self._values to avoid a reference cycle
    period = weakref.ref(self._values)
    return self._engine_type(period, len(self._values))
```
In this revision, we are weakly referencing `self._values` instead of `self` to avoid the reference cycle, ensuring that it is preserved until it is no longer needed.

The corrected code ensures that weak referencing is correctly used, preventing the premature dropping of the weakly referenced object. This should resolve the bug and allow the `test_get_level_values_when_periods` test case to pass without errors.
