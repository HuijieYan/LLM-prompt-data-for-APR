The bug seems to be occurring within the `PeriodEngine` class when the `is_monotonic_increasing` attribute is accessed. This is likely because the weakly referenced `PeriodIndex` object is getting dropped before it is intended to, resulting in a `NoneType` object being accessed by the `PeriodEngine`.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object is maintained for the lifetime of the `PeriodEngine` object.

We can fix the bug by modifying the `_engine` function to maintain a weak reference to the `PeriodIndex` object throughout the lifetime of the `_engine` object. Here's the corrected function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # Maintain a weak reference to self for the lifetime of the _engine object
    self._weakref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(self._weakref, len(self))
```

By maintaining a weak reference to `self` throughout the lifetime of the `_engine` object, we ensure that the `PeriodEngine` always has a valid reference to the `PeriodIndex` object, preventing the `NoneType` error.

Please replace the original `_engine` function with the corrected version provided above to resolve the bug.
