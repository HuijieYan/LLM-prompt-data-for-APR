The bug occurs in the `_engine` function where a weak reference of `self` is created but it's not being utilized in the subsequent code properly. The error message indicates that the `PeriodEngine` is getting a `None` instead of the expected `PeriodIndex`.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the weak reference is used correctly to avoid reference cycles and properly pass the weakly referenced `self` to the `_engine_type` while creating the `PeriodEngine`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_engine` function:

```python
@cache_readonly
def _engine(self):
    # To avoid a reference cycle, create a weakref of self
    period_ref = weakref.ref(self)
    return self._engine_type(period_ref(), len(self))
```

By using the weakly referenced `self`, we avoid the reference cycle and ensure that the `PeriodEngine` receives the `PeriodIndex` as expected, fixing the bug.

The fix ensures that weakrefs are utilized properly to avoid the issue of lost weakrefs in MultiIndex levels. This addresses the bug and ensures that the `PeriodEngine` receives the intended `PeriodIndex` instead of `None`.
