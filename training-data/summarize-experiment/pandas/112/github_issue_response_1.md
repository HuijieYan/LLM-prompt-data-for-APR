Summary:
The issue describes a situation where the round method fails to work when the columns of a DataFrame are a CategoricalIndex created from an IntervalIndex. The problem occurs when using the pd.cut function, which generates these types of values, and they can be found in columns when using pivot_table. The expected output is that the round method should work as normal, but currently, it results in a TypeError with the message "No matching signature found." This bug negatively impacts the functionality and usability of the pandas library, particularly when dealing with categorical and interval data. Resolving this issue is crucial for ensuring the optimal performance and reliability of the round method when working with CategoricalIndex and IntervalIndex columns.
