The error message "No matching signature found" in the test case `test_round_interval_category_columns` suggests that there is an issue with the `get_indexer` method, which is being used internally by the `round` function. This error is likely related to a mismatch in the signature expectations of the `get_indexer` function, specifically in the types of parameters being passed to it.

Based on the provided information, it seems that the code within the `get_indexer` function performs operations based on the types and values of the input parameters. However, the error message indicates that the method is not receiving the correct arguments, leading to a "No matching signature found" error.

To address this bug, it's important to review the method signature of `get_indexer` and ensure that the correct types of arguments are being provided when it is used internally. This may involve checking the usage of `get_indexer` with the appropriate types of parameters and ensuring that the method is being called with the expected input.

One approach for fixing the bug is to carefully review the usage of the `get_indexer` method throughout the code and verify that the input parameters match the expected types. It may also be necessary to modify the method signature or the way it is called to ensure that the correct arguments are provided.

Here is the corrected code for the `get_indexer` function, addressing the potential signature mismatch issue:

```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if not self.is_overlapping:  # Use "not" instead of "if self.is_overlapping"
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # remaining code remains unchanged

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In this corrected version, the conditional check for `self.is_overlapping` has been updated to use the `not` operator, ensuring that the correct block of code is executed based on the expected condition. Additionally, the logic and operations within the function remain unchanged, as the bug was related to the method signature mismatch.
