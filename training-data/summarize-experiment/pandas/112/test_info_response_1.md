From the test function `test_round_interval_category_columns`, we can see that a DataFrame is created using the `pd.CategoricalIndex` and the `pd.interval_range` functions. The DataFrame is then processed using the `round` function, which is expected to round the columns of the DataFrame to the nearest integer.

The error message is pointing to a problem with the `get_indexer` method. It states, `E   TypeError: No matching signature found`, and the relevant line is inside the `pandas/_libs/intervaltree.pxi` file. This suggests there may be an issue with the signature of the `get_indexer` function used internally by the `round` function.

Looking at the part of the `get_indexer` function that is used here:
```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    ...
```

It seems that the `get_indexer` function has a mismatch in its signature expectations. It is expecting specific method arguments, but when used internally, it's not receiving them correctly.

One potential issue is that the `get_indexer` method is being used with a `scalar_t` type as a parameter. It might be worthwhile to check the appropriate usage of `GetIndexer` and ensure that the correct arguments are provided.

This error might be occurring due to an incorrect type passed to the `get_indexer` method, leading to a "No matching signature found" error. This indicates a type-related issue, and it may be necessary to review the parameter types and how they are used throughout the code related to the `get_indexer` method.
