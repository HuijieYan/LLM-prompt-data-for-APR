The bug in the provided function `get_indexer` is related to the mismatch in signature expectations, which is causing a "No matching signature found" error. This issue is impacting the functionality of the round method when working with CategoricalIndex and IntervalIndex columns, as observed in the test case.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely related to the usage of the `get_indexer` method and its interaction with the CategoricalIndex and IntervalIndex columns. The mismatch in signature expectations may be leading to the TypeError encountered during the execution of the round method.

The bug is occurring due to the incorrect type passed to the `get_indexer` method, resulting in a "No matching signature found" error. This indicates a type-related issue, and it's necessary to review the parameter types and their usage throughout the code related to the `get_indexer` method.

To fix the bug, it is important to ensure that the `get_indexer` method is used with the correct arguments and that the signature expectations are met. The correct parameter types should be provided to the `get_indexer` method to avoid the "No matching signature found" error.

Below is the revised version of the `get_indexer` function that resolves the issue:

```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
    
        common_subtype = find_common_type(
            [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
        )
        if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

        left_indexer = self.left().get_indexer(target_as_index.left())
        right_indexer = self.right().get_indexer(target_as_index.right())
        indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine().get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        indexer = [self.get_loc(key) for key in target_as_index]

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the revised function, some adjustments have been made to ensure that the correct methods are called with appropriate parameters, and the necessary checks are performed as expected. This revised version addresses the type-related issue and resolves the "No matching signature found" error encountered in the original buggy version of the function.
