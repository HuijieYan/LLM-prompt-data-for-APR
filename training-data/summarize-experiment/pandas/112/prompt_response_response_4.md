Based on the test case, the error message, and the runtime variables and types, it appears that the issue lies within the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class. The error message "No matching signature found" suggests that there is a mismatch in the method signature expectations and the actual arguments being passed.

Upon review, it seems that the bug occurs when the `get_indexer` method is used with a `scalar_t` type as a parameter, resulting in a type-related issue. The method expects specific method arguments, but when used internally, it's not receiving them correctly.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `get_indexer` method is invoked with the correct arguments based on its signature. Additionally, we should verify the appropriate usage of `GetIndexer` and review the parameter types and how they are used throughout the code related to the `get_indexer` method.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function that resolves the bug:

def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if not self.is_overlapping:  # Changed from self.is_overlapping to not self.is_overlapping
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

        # different closed or incompatible subtype -> no matches
        common_subtype = find_common_type(
            [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
        )
        if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

        # non-overlapping -> at most one match per interval in target_as_index
        # want exact matches -> need both left/right to match, so defer to
        # left/right get_indexer, compare elementwise, equality -> match
        left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
        right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
        indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        # heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
        # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
        indexer = []
        for key in target_as_index:
            try:
                loc = self.get_loc(key)
            except KeyError:
                loc = -1
            indexer.append(loc)

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected version:
1. The condition to check if `self.is_overlapping` was changed to `if not self.is_overlapping` to properly handle the case when it's not overlapping.
2. No changes were made within the internal blocks of the function, as they seem to be working correctly based on the provided information.
3. The corrected function should now properly handle the input arguments and execute the appropriate operations based on the conditions.

This revised function should address the bug by ensuring that the `get_indexer` method is invoked with the correct arguments and that the logic within the method works as expected.
