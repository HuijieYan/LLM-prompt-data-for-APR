Based on the test case and error message, it seems that the issue is related to the usage of the `get_indexer` method within the `round` function. The error message "No matching signature found" indicates a potential problem with the signature of the `get_indexer` function.

The bug is occurring in the `get_indexer` function due to a potential mismatch in the signature expectations. The function is expecting specific method arguments, but when used internally, it's not receiving them correctly. This may be due to an incorrect type passed to the `get_indexer` method, leading to the "No matching signature found" error. This indicates a type-related issue, and it may be necessary to review the parameter types and how they are used throughout the code related to the `get_indexer` method.

To fix the bug, it is important to ensure that the `get_indexer` function receives the correct method arguments and handles them appropriately. Reviewing the parameter types and their usage throughout the code related to the `get_indexer` method is crucial. Additionally, thorough testing and validation of the logic behind the comparisons and operations performed within the function is necessary to ensure correctness.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function, `get_indexer`:

```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # Equal indexes -> 1:1 positional match
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")

        # Different closed or incompatible subtype -> no matches
        common_subtype = find_common_type(
            [self.dtype.subtype, target_as_index.dtype.subtype]
        )
        if self.closed != target_as_index.closed or is_object_dtype(common_subtype):
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))

        # Non-overlapping -> at most one match per interval in target_as_index
        # Want exact matches -> need both left/right to match, so defer to
        # left/right get_indexer, compare elementwise, equality -> match
        left_indexer = self.left().get_indexer(target_as_index.left())
        right_indexer = self.right().get_indexer(target_as_index.right())
        indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # Homogeneous scalar index: use IntervalTree
        target_as_index_i8 = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine().get_indexer(target_as_index_i8.values, method=method, limit=limit, tolerance=tolerance)
    else:
        # Heterogeneous scalar index: defer elementwise to get_loc
        # (non-overlapping so get_loc guarantees scalar of KeyError)
        indexer = np.array([self.get_loc(key, method=method, tolerance=tolerance) for key in target_as_index], dtype='intp')

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In the corrected code, we have made the following changes:
1. Corrected the usage of `left()` and `right()` functions to obtain the left and right boundary values for comparison.
2. Added appropriate method arguments `method`, `limit`, and `tolerance` when calling the `get_indexer` and `get_loc` methods.
3. Used `np.array` to create an array of indexers in the case of a heterogeneous scalar index.

These changes will ensure that the `get_indexer` function receives the correct method arguments and handles them appropriately. Additionally, it addresses potential issues with type mismatches and ensures the proper handling of different index types.
