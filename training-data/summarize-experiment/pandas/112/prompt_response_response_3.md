Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug is related to the `get_indexer` method within the `pd.IntervalIndex` class. The error message "No matching signature found" suggests that there might be a type-related issue or an incorrect usage of the method's signature.

The `get_indexer` method expects specific method arguments, and when used internally, it's not receiving them correctly, leading to the error. This could be due to a mismatch in the signature expectations or an incorrect type being passed to the method.

To address this bug, it's necessary to review the parameter types and how they are used throughout the code related to the `get_indexer` method. It may also be beneficial to ensure that the correct arguments are provided when calling the `get_indexer` method internally.

It's important to carefully examine the logic and operations performed within the `get_indexer` method to ensure that they align with the expected behavior based on the provided test case and error message.

Here is the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:

This corrected version includes method invocations with parentheses to ensure that methods are called and their return values are used appropriately. It also addresses potential issues related to the comparison of closed intervals and the handling of different data types. The corrections aim to align the function's behavior with the expected functionality based on the provided test case and error message.
