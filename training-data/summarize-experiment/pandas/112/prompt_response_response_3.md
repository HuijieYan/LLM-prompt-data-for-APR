The error in the `get_indexer` function could be due to the mismatch in signature of the functions called within the `get_indexer` function with the specified arguments. This could be causing a TypeError with no matching signature found.

To fix this issue, we need to first ensure that the method calls and comparisons within the `get_indexer` function are consistent with the expected behavior for the given input values. Additionally, it's important to verify that all the methods included in the function are being called with the correct arguments and that the comparisons are being performed appropriately.

A potential approach for fixing the bug is to carefully review the conditions and comparisons within the `get_indexer` function and ensure that they are compatible with the operations being performed. This may involve checking the implementation of each method being called and comparing their expected behavior with the actual behavior seen in the buggy function.

Furthermore, it's important to validate the compatibility of handling interval data and rounding operations in pandas to understand the nature of the type mismatch that leads to the TypeError.

Here's the corrected version of the `get_indexer` function:
