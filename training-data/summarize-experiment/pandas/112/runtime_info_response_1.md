From the variable logs, we can see that the function `get_indexer` is being provided with an `IntervalIndex` object named `self` as well as a `target` parameter of the same type. The `self` object has attributes such as `is_overlapping`, `equals`, `dtype`, `closed`, `left`, `right`, and several methods like `get_indexer`, `_maybe_convert_i8`, `get_loc`.

Looking at the code inside the function, we can see conditional statements based on the type of the `target_as_index` variable. When `target_as_index` is an instance of `IntervalIndex`, the code checks for various conditions related to index matching and interval properties. On the other hand, when `target_as_index` is not an `IntervalIndex`, the function follows a different code path.

The issue may lie in the conditional statements and the logic for handling `IntervalIndex` objects. It's crucial to examine the comparison and arithmetic operations being performed, especially when dealing with left and right indexes. Additionally, the `ensure_platform_int` function at the end must also be thoroughly checked. 

Finally, thorough testing with various inputs and edge cases will also be necessary to ensure the function behaves correctly in all scenarios.
