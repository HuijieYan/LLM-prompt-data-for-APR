From the runtime values and types provided, we can see that the function `get_indexer` takes several input parameters and performs different operations based on the types of those parameters.

First, it checks if `self.is_overlapping` is `False`, and if it is, it proceeds with the operations inside the `if` block. In the provided case, `self.is_overlapping` is indeed `False`, so it enters the block.

Inside the block, it first checks if `target_as_index` is an `IntervalIndex`. Since the `target` variable is an `IntervalIndex`, it enters the first `if` block.

Within the `if` block, it performs operations based on the comparisons of `self` and `target_as_index`. It checks if they are equal, and if not, it compares other attributes. Then, it calculates `left_indexer` and `right_indexer`, and eventually creates an `indexer` based on the values of these two variables.

After this, it returns `ensure_platform_int(indexer)`.

From the provided variables and their types, it seems that the operations are being performed as expected based on the values and types of the variables. However, it's important to note that the correctness of the calculations and comparisons within the function can only be validated through rigorous testing and potentially reviewing the logic behind the comparisons and operations performed within the function.
