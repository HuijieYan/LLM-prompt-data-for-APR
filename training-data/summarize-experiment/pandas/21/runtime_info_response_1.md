From the input value and type for buggy function from the first to the fourth buggy case, we can see that the input parameter key has different types: list, ndarray, Index, and Series. The function first checks if the input key is a slice, DataFrame, tuple, or scalar. If none of these conditions are met, it continues to evaluate the type of the input key to decide whether to treat it as a positional indexer (iloc) or label-based (loc) indexer.

Looking closely at the function, we see that the return for the `loc` and `iloc` attributes is determined by the inferred type of the `key`. Based on the values of `self.loc` and `self.iloc` before the function return in all buggy cases, we can see that the final value of `self.loc` and `self.iloc` are from the truth condition.

If we analyze key_type, it's set to 'string' in all buggy cases. This indicates that the inferred type is not being evaluated correctly and always resulting in 'string'. This leads to an incorrect return from the function, causing the test cases to fail.

The code logic to determine the inferred type of key is flawed. It needs to be revisited and debugged to correctly identify the type of the key, leading to the appropriate return from the function. Without more information about how the `infer_dtype` or `is_bool_indexer` methods are implemented, it's challenging to pinpoint the exact issue. However, this analysis narrows down the problem to the inferred type check and provides a clear direction for further debugging.
