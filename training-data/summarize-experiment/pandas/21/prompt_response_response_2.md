Based on the provided information, it is evident that the `_get_with` function is not handling the various types of input key parameters consistently. This inconsistency leads to unexpected behavior and error messages, especially when the key doesn't match any index in the Series. The bug is likely located within the logic that determines the type of the input key and the subsequent handling of different key types. This inconsistency might be attributed to the conditions used to recognize the key types or the processing of non-list_like types.

To address this bug, it is essential to ensure that the function correctly identifies the type of the input key and processes it accordingly. The function should handle different types of keys consistently to guarantee expected behavior and prevent unexpected errors.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses this bug and ensures consistent handling of different key types:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, np.ndarray) or isinstance(key, pd.Index) or isinstance(key, pd.Series):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    key = list(key)

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the provided fix, the conditions for recognizing the key types have been adjusted to ensure consistent handling. The logic for recognizing slice, array-like, and non-list_like types has been refined to address the bug by ensuring that the function correctly processes different key types. This should lead to consistent and expected behavior when indexing the `ser` Series with various types of keys.
