The issue in the given function `_get_with` lies within the conditional blocks that handle different types of input `key`. The conditions for determining the type of `key` are not effectively capturing all possible types, leading to unexpected behavior and incorrect returns. This is reflected in the test case `test_getitem_no_matches`, where the expectations for different types of input `key` are not consistently met, resulting in the failure to raise a `KeyError`.

The function should be revised to accurately classify and handle the different types of input `key`, ensuring that each conditional block returns the expected result based on the input type. Additionally, the handling of the `reindex` method within the function should be reviewed and potentially revised to ensure it correctly handles the input `key`.

Here's the corrected version of the function `_get_with`:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    key = ensure_index(key)

    if is_bool(key):
        return self.reindex(key)

    if is_integer(key):
        return self.iloc[key]

    if is_object_dtype(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have used the `is_bool`, `is_integer`, and `is_object_dtype` functions to accurately classify and handle different types of `key`. Additionally, we ensure that the input `key` is converted to an Index type using `ensure_index` to ensure consistent handling. The `reindex`, `iloc`, and `loc` methods are used based on the type of `key` to ensure the expected behavior and returns.
