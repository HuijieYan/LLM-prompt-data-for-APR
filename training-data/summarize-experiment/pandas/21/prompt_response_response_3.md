Based on the test case and error message, it appears that the bug is related to the inconsistent behavior of the Series when indexing with different types of keys. The error message indicates that for a list key, the `ser[list(key)]` operation raises a `KeyError` with the message "None of [Index(['C'], dtype='object')] are in the [index]". This inconsistency is not expected, as other indexers of different types do not raise the same error.

Upon analyzing the buggy function, it seems that the issue might be related to the logic for determining the inferred type of the key. The function uses conditional statements to process the key based on its type, and the inferred type determination might be faulty, leading to incorrect behavior when indexing with a list key.

One potential approach to fixing the bug is to review and possibly revise the logic for determining the inferred type of the key. It might be beneficial to ensure that the proper type checking and inference are performed for list-like keys to avoid the unexpected KeyError.

Here's the corrected version of the _get_with function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "boolean":
        # The key_type == "boolean" case should be caught by the
        # com.is_bool_indexer check in __getitem__
        raise KeyError(f"None of [{key}] are in the [index]")

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected version, we have added a check for the key_type "boolean" to raise a KeyError with the appropriate message. This ensures consistent behavior when using different types of keys for indexing the Series.

It's important to thoroughly test the revised function with various types of keys to ensure that the bug has been resolved and that the Series behaves consistently across different types of indexers. Additionally, any associated test cases should be re-run to validate the fix.
