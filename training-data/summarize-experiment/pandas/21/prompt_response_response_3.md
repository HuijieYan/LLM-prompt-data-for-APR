The problematic function `_get_with` appears to handle different types of input parameters and process them accordingly. However, based on the test cases and their related error messages, it seems that the function is not handling non-matching keys correctly, leading to unexpected behavior. This discrepancy in handling list indexers and array-like indexers has resulted in inconsistencies in the behavior of the function.

Upon further analysis, it appears that the root cause of the bug lies within the logic for identifying and handling the type of the input key. The conditions in the function should accurately recognize the type of the input parameter and process it accordingly to ensure consistent behavior across all scenarios.

To resolve this bug, it is necessary to review the logic for identifying the type of the input key and ensure that it is processed correctly based on the identified type. Additionally, any discrepancies in the behavior of list indexers and array-like indexers should be addressed to ensure consistent and logical operation across all cases.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function `_get_with`:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_list_like(key):
        if not is_scalar(key):
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:  # e.g. if input is a scalar that's not recognized by lib.is_scalar
            return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected code:
1. The function checks if the input key is list-like and not a scalar. If it is not a scalar, it proceeds to decide whether to use positional-based or label-based indexing.
2. If the input key is a scalar that is not recognized by `lib.is_scalar`, it falls back to using label-based indexing.

These changes aim to ensure that the input key is processed correctly based on its type, addressing the inconsistencies and potential issues observed in the original function. The revised code should provide a more consistent and logical operation across all scenarios.
