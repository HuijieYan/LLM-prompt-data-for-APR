Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the relevant test cases, it is evident that the function is not handling the different types of input keys correctly. The function is expected to handle slice, DataFrame, tuple, and other list-like types properly. However, the conditions to identify these types and handle them accordingly appear to be flawed.

The repeated outcome of `key_type` being determined as 'string' across all buggy cases signals a potential issue in recognizing the type of the key during runtime. Additionally, the function might not be correctly identifying non-list-like types, leading to unexpected behavior and error messages in the test cases.

To resolve this issue, the function needs to be updated to accurately identify the type of the input key and handle it according to the expected behavior for each type.

Below is the corrected version of the function that addresses the identified issues:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        # _convert_slice_indexer to determine if this slice is positional
        #  or label based, and if the latter, convert to positional
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) and not is_scalar(key):  # Corrected condition
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)  # Moved this line up to handle correct type identification

    else:
        raise TypeError("Unsupported key type")  # Added a catch-all condition for unsupported key types

    if is_bool(key):
        if key_type == "boolean":  # Added condition to handle boolean indexing
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            raise ValueError("Boolean indexing is only supported with boolean Series or DataFrame")  # Added error message for unsupported boolean indexing

    elif is_integer(key):
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]
    
    # Removed handling of key being a list, as it is redundant after previous checks

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected function, the key type identification process has been adjusted to ensure that all types (including non-list-like types) are handled correctly. Additionally, specific conditions and error messages have been added to handle boolean indexing and unsupported key types. This approach aims to resolve the bug in the function by accurately identifying and handling different types of input keys.
