Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the test cases, it appears that the key issue lies in the conditional logic for determining the inferred type of the key. The function consistently sets the inferred type to 'string', causing unexpected behavior and the failure to raise the expected `KeyError` in the test cases. This can be attributed to a flaw in the code logic that determines the inferred type of the key.

To fix the bug, the conditional logic for inferring the type of the key should be revised and debugged to correctly identify the type of the key. This will ensure that the appropriate return is generated from the function, aligning with the expectations from the different types of keys.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
``` 

In the corrected version, the conditional statement for non-list-like keys has been modified to check if the key is a scalar using the `is_scalar` function. This allows for more accurate handling of scalar values. Additionally, the key_type is inferred via the `lib.infer_dtype` function to ensure correct typing.

By making these adjustments, the function now correctly handles different types of keys and should produce the expected behavior in the test cases. This updated version can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy function.
