Based on the analysis, it appears that the potential error location within the `_get_with` function lies in the initial checks for the type of the input parameter. The function should correctly identify the type of the input parameter and handle it accordingly. 

The bug occurs due to the inconsistency in recognizing the type of the key and handling non-list_like types, resulting in the unintended behavior of the function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Reviewing the logic for recognizing the type of the key and ensuring that it accurately identifies the type of the input parameter.
2. Implementing a more robust and consistent handling of different types of input parameters, ensuring that the function behaves predictably with various types of indexers.
3. Modifying the conditional statements and type checks in the function to cover all possible types of valid indexers, ensuring comprehensive handling of each type.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```
This revised version of the function addresses the potential issues with the original implementation by ensuring logical and consistent handling of different types of indexers. It includes appropriate checks and handling for slice, DataFrame, tuple, list-like, and other types of indexers, resulting in a more robust and predictable behavior.
