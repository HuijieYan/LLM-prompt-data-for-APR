Based on the analysis, the bug in the `_get_with` function appears to be related to the incorrect inference of the key type, leading to the wrong return value and causing the test cases to fail.

The issue is specifically related to the conditional handling of the key type and the logic for inferring the type, which results in the function failing to raise the expected `KeyError` when accessing a non-existing key within the Series.

To fix the bug, the logic for inferring the key type needs to be revised to accurately identify the type of the input key and execute the appropriate block of code based on the inferred type.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, pd.DataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        # e.g. scalars that aren't recognized by lib.is_scalar, GH#32684
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError as e:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index") from e
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, pd.Series, pd.Index)):
        if isinstance(key, pd.Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version of the function, the conditional handling of the key type has been revised to accurately infer the type of the input key and execute the appropriate code block based on the inferred type. Additionally, a `KeyError` exception is raised explicitly when accessing a non-existing key within the Series.

This revised function should address the bug by correctly handling the type of the input key and ensuring the proper return value based on the inferred type, resolving the issue that led to the failed test cases.
