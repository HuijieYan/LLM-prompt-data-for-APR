Based on the provided buggy function and the detailed test case analysis, it is evident that the primary issue lies within the conditional branches of the `_get_with` method, particularly in the handling of different types of input `key`. The function is not accurately classifying the types of input `key` and consequently defaults to the last conditional block, resulting in a call to `self.reindex(key)`.

To address this issue, the conditional logic within the function needs to be revised to accurately classify and handle the different types of input `key`, ensuring that each conditional block returns the expected result based on the input type. Additionally, the implementation of `self.reindex` might need to be reviewed and potentially revised to ensure it handles the input `key` correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` method that addresses the identified issues and incorporates the necessary changes based on the detailed analysis:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # handle slice indexer
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    
    # handle DataFrame indexer
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    
    # handle tuple indexer
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    
    # handle non-list-like indexer
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    
    # handle specific types of indexers
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        # handle integer indexer
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        # handle list indexer
        elif isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
    
    # handle reindexing for other cases
    return self.reindex(key)
```

The revised function includes improved conditional checks and handling for different types of input `key`, ensuring that appropriate actions are taken based on the type of the input. This should address the identified issues and ensure that the function behaves as expected for various types of input `key`.

Please note that the corrected function is designed to be a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function. Use the provided corrected code to replace the buggy function in the relevant codebase.
