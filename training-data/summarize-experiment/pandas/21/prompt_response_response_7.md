Based on the given information, it seems that the bug occurs in the `_get_with` function of the `Series` class. The function is intended to handle different types of input keys and perform specific actions based on the type of the key. However, the function has inconsistencies in recognizing the type of the input key, leading to unexpected behavior when indexing the `ser` Series.

The function checks for slice, DataFrame, and tuple types and then proceeds to handle the input based on its type. However, there seems to be a problem in identifying the correct type of the key, leading to the incorrect determination of `key_type` and subsequent unexpected behavior.

To address this bug, the following approaches can be considered:
1. Review the logic for identifying the type of the input key and ensure that it accurately determines whether the key is list-like, scalar, or of a specific type.
2. Ensure that the function's logic for handling different types of input keys is consistent and aligns with the intended behavior.
3. Validate the `key_type` determination process and adjust it to accurately reflect the type of the input key.
4. Test the function with various input key types to verify that it behaves as expected in all cases.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the identified issues:
```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key) or is_dict_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, ABCSeries, Index)):
        return self.reindex(key)

    raise NotImplementedError("Key type not supported for indexing: {}".format(type(key)))
```
Note: The corrected function includes adjustments to the type recognition logic and handles different types of keys as per the intended behavior. The function now explicitly raises an error for unsupported key types, providing a more robust and consistent behavior.
