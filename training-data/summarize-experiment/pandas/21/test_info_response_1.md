The test functions under directory `pandas/tests/series/indexing/test_getitem.py`, specifically the `test_getitem_no_matches` function, focus on testing the behavior of the `ser` Series when being indexed with a key that doesn't match any index in the Series. The key gets converted to a `box` using the specified box function, which could be either a `list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, or `pd.Series`. For the case where the key doesn't match any index in the Series, a `KeyError` exception is expected to be raised with a specific message.

In the error message resulting from the execution of the failed test case, it is indicated that the line `ser[key]` failed to raise a KeyError as expected.

This error reveals that the `ser` Series does not handle keys that don't match any index as anticipated. Specifically, this could be an issue within the `_get_with` function that determines how to handle different types of keys. Further analysis of the `ser` Series indexing behavior and the corresponding logic within the `_get_with` function is required to identify the root cause of this discrepancy. This error message implies that the `_get_with` function may not be handling non-matching keys correctly, leading to an unexpected behavior when the `ser` Series is indexed with such keys.
