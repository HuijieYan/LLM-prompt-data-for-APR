Based on the analysis of the provided information, it is evident that the `_get_with` function is not handling the different types of input key parameters correctly, leading to inconsistent behavior and unexpected outcomes. The potential error location is within the initial series of `if-elif` statements, where the type of the input key is checked and processed. The inconsistent determination of the key type and subsequent handling of the key parameter might be causing the unexpected behavior observed in the test cases.

The bug seems to stem from the incorrect recognition of the input key type, leading to the misinterpretation of whether positional or label-based indexing should be utilized. This results in unexpected KeyError exceptions and inconsistent behavior across different types of indexers.

To address this bug, it is necessary to standardize the handling of different types of input key parameters. This can be achieved by revising the logic for type recognition and indexing approach determination. Additionally, a more consistent and uniform approach to handling various key types is required to ensure reliable and expected behavior in all scenarios.

The corrected code for the `_get_with` function is provided below, with the necessary revisions to address the bug by standardizing the handling of different types of input key parameters and ensuring a more reliable and consistent outcome in all scenarios.

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # handle slice
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    # handle DataFrame
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    # handle tuple
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # handle non-list-like
    elif not is_list_like(key):
        try:
            return self.loc[key]
        except KeyError:
            raise KeyError(f"None of {key} are in the index")

    # handle other cases
    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        if is_bool(key):
            key_type = "boolean"
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    # handle integer type
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    # handle list type
    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    # handle other cases with reindex
    return self.reindex(key)
```

The revised version of the `_get_with` function includes a standardized and more consistent approach to handling different types of input key parameters. It ensures that the recognition of the key type and the determination of the indexing approach are uniform and reliable across all scenarios, addressing the bug causing inconsistent behavior and unexpected KeyError exceptions.
