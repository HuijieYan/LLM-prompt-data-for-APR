This function, `_get_with`, is designed to handle different types of inputs and extract data from a Series object. 

The function takes an input parameter, `key`, and based on its type, executes different logic. The first condition checks if the `key` is a slice, then does necessary conversions and returns the result. The second condition raises a `TypeError` if `key` is of type `DataFrame`. The third condition deals with tuple inputs and retrieves the values based on the key. 

The next block checks if `key` is not list-like and returns the location of the element identified by `key`. If the `key` is not list-like and not an instance of a list, a NumPy array, a pandas ExtensionArray, a Series, or an Index, it converts the `key` to a list. 

After this, it uses the `lib.infer_dtype` method to infer the type of the `key`. If the type is identified as an integer, it determines whether the positional or label-based indexer should be used. If the former applies, the `iloc` method is called with the `key`, otherwise, the `loc` method is used.

Subsequently, it checks if `key` is an instance of a list, and if so, it handles duplicate indexing by returning the location of the elements identified by `key`. Finally, if none of the previous conditions are satisfied, it calls the `reindex` method with the `key` and returns its result.

Based on the expected variable values and types before function return, the function should perform these conditional checks to correctly determine the type of `key,` its appropriate handling, and return the expected results.
