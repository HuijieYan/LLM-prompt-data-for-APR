The _get_with function is responsible for returning data based on the input key. The function has conditional statements that check the type of the input key and execute different blocks of logic accordingly.

1. If the key is of type `slice`, it converts the slice indexer and returns the sliced data from the Series.

2. If the key is of type `ABCDataFrame`, it raises a TypeError since indexing a Series with a DataFrame is not supported.

3. If the key is of type `tuple`, it returns the data based on the provided tuple key.

4. If the key is not list-like, it checks if the key is recognized as a scalar by the library. If not, it returns data based on label indexing using `self.loc`.

5. If the key is of type `list`, it reassigns the key to be a list.

6. If the key is of type `Index`, it determines the type of the key and assigns it to the variable `key_type`. Otherwise, it infers the type and assigns it to `key_type`.

7. If the `key_type` is "integer", it checks whether to treat it as a positional indexer and returns data based on that decision.

8. If the key is of type `list`, it handles the duplicate indexing case and returns the appropriate data.

9. For any other type of the key, it reindexes and returns the data using `self.reindex`.

The function's logic generally relies on checking the type of the input key and processing it differently based on its type, along with handling additional checks such as recognizing scalar values or handling duplicate index cases. The aim is to return the appropriate data from the Series based on the input key.
