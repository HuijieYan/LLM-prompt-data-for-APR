## Functions Used in the Buggy Function
```python# class declaration containing the buggy function
class Series(base.IndexOpsMixin, generic.NDFrame):
    """
    One-dimensional ndarray with axis labels (including time series).
    
    Labels need not be unique but must be a hashable type. The object
    supports both integer- and label-based indexing and provides a host of
    methods for performing operations involving the index. Statistical
    methods from ndarray have been overridden to automatically exclude
    missing data (currently represented as NaN).
    
    Operations between Series (+, -, /, *, **) align values based on their
    associated index values-- they need not be the same length. The result
    index will be the sorted union of the two indexes.
    
    Parameters
    ----------
    data : array-like, Iterable, dict, or scalar value
        Contains data stored in Series.
    
        .. versionchanged:: 0.23.0
           If data is a dict, argument order is maintained for Python 3.6
           and later.
    
    index : array-like or Index (1d)
        Values must be hashable and have the same length as `data`.
        Non-unique index values are allowed. Will default to
        RangeIndex (0, 1, 2, ..., n) if not provided. If both a dict and index
        sequence are used, the index will override the keys found in the
        dict.
    dtype : str, numpy.dtype, or ExtensionDtype, optional
        Data type for the output Series. If not specified, this will be
        inferred from `data`.
        See the :ref:`user guide <basics.dtypes>` for more usages.
    name : str, optional
        The name to give to the Series.
    copy : bool, default False
        Copy input data.

## Test Case Summary
The test function `test_getitem_no_matches` utilizes the `pytest` framework to verify whether a specific error message is raised, and thus covers a critical part of the functionality of the `_get_with` method from the provided buggy function.

The test function is defined within the `test_getitem.py` file located in the `pandas/tests/series/indexing` directory of the project and contains a parameterized unit test, which uses the `@pytest.mark.parametrize` annotation to test different kinds of data structures such as `list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, and `pd.Series` when used as an index to the `ser` Series created within the test function.

The error message resulting from this test failure, `Failed: DID NOT RAISE <class 'KeyError'>`, indicates that when the index `key` is passed to the `ser` Series, it is expected that a `KeyError` will be raised, but it did not happen as expected. This is a critical piece of information for diagnosing the issue within the `_get_with` method.

In the test function, the `ser` Series is defined as `Series(["A", "B"])`, and the key is created using `key = Series(["C"], dtype=object)`. This `key` then undergoes an operation of typecasting via the `box` parameter to test different data structures (`list`, `np.array`, `pd.Index`, and `pd.Series`).

The critical part to notice is the line `ser[key]`, which is expected to raise a `KeyError`, but it failed to do so. This failure is directly tied to the conditional branches throughout the `_get_with` method, particularly those involving `Index`, `list`, and `tuple`.

Therefore, the issue lies within the `conditional` branches within the `_get_with` method where the conditions for handling `key` as different data types are defined. The failure in the test clearly points to a problem either with the conditional checks based on these data types or the actual behavior of the function when handling the given `key` data type. Hence, the root cause of the problem can be narrowed down to these conditional branches.

This detailed analysis will guide the developer to focus directly on the conditional branches within the `_get_with` method, providing a clear path for debugging and resolution.



## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

### Diagnosis and Exploration

The buggy function, `_get_with`, is designed to handle different types of input keys and return the appropriate values from a series. We'll dive into the details of each buggy case and analyze how the variable values at the point of return from the function correspond with the code.

### Buggy Case 1:
In this case, the input parameter `key` is a list `['C']`. The subsequent if-elif-else block checks the type of `key`. It first checks if it is a slice, then if it is a DataFrame, and then if it is a tuple. As none of these conditions are met, the code proceeds to the last conditional block.

At the point of return from the function, the `key_type` is 'string', and the condition `key_type == "integer"` doesn't hold true. This results in returning the output of `self.reindex(key)`.

### Buggy Case 2:
The input parameter `key` in this case is an ndarray, specifically `array(['C'], dtype=object)`. The subsequent if-elif-else block follows the same pattern of checking the type of `key`.

At the point of return from the function, similar to case 1, the `key_type` is 'string'. Consequently, the last conditional block is executed, leading to the return of `self.reindex(key)`.

### Buggy Case 3:
Here, the input parameter `key` is an Index object of type `Index(['C'], dtype='object')`. Again, the conditional block validates the type of `key` and proceeds with a similar execution pattern as Case 1 and 2.

At the point of return from the function, the `key_type` is 'string', and the last conditional block is executed, resulting in the return of `self.reindex(key)`.

### Buggy Case 4:
In this case, the input `key` is a Series object, `0    C
dtype: object`. The type of `key` is not explicitly checked in the conditional blocks, but the subsequent logic handles different types of input.

At the point of return from the function, the `key_type` is 'string', and hence, the last conditional block is executed, leading to the return of `self.reindex(key)`.

### Summary:
In all the buggy cases, the conditional blocks within the function do not provide a specific match for the types or values of the input `key`. As a result, the last conditional block executes, leading to the return of `self.reindex(key)`.

To address this issue, the conditional logic in the function should be re-evaluated to accurately classify and handle the different types of input `key`, ensuring that each conditional block returns the expected result based on the input type.

Furthermore, given that the output from the last conditional block is `self.reindex(key)` in all the buggy cases, there might be a need to review and potentially revise the implementation of `self.reindex` to ensure it handles the input `key` correctly.



## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

This function, `_get_with`, is designed to handle different types of inputs and extract data from a Series object. 

The function takes an input parameter, `key`, and based on its type, executes different logic. The first condition checks if the `key` is a slice, then does necessary conversions and returns the result. The second condition raises a `TypeError` if `key` is of type `DataFrame`. The third condition deals with tuple inputs and retrieves the values based on the key. 

The next block checks if `key` is not list-like and returns the location of the element identified by `key`. If the `key` is not list-like and not an instance of a list, a NumPy array, a pandas ExtensionArray, a Series, or an Index, it converts the `key` to a list. 

After this, it uses the `lib.infer_dtype` method to infer the type of the `key`. If the type is identified as an integer, it determines whether the positional or label-based indexer should be used. If the former applies, the `iloc` method is called with the `key`, otherwise, the `loc` method is used.

Subsequently, it checks if `key` is an instance of a list, and if so, it handles duplicate indexing by returning the location of the elements identified by `key`. Finally, if none of the previous conditions are satisfied, it calls the `reindex` method with the `key` and returns its result.

Based on the expected variable values and types before function return, the function should perform these conditional checks to correctly determine the type of `key,` its appropriate handling, and return the expected results.



# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
API: Series[index_with_no_matches] vs Series[list_with_no_matches]
```

## The associated detailed issue description
```text
We treat list indexers differently from array-like indexers:

ser = pd.Series(["A", "B"])
key = pd.Series(["C"])

>>> ser[key]
C    NaN
dtype: object

>>> ser[pd.Index(key)]
C    NaN
dtype: object

>>> ser[np.array(key)]
C    NaN
dtype: object

>>> ser[list(key)]
Traceback (most recent call last):
[...]
  File "/Users/bmendel/Desktop/pd/pandas/pandas/core/indexing.py", line 1312, in _validate_read_indexer
    raise KeyError(f"None of [{key}] are in the [{axis_name}]")
KeyError: "None of [Index(['C'], dtype='object')] are in the [index]"
Also inconsistent because ser.loc[key] raises for all 4 cases.

Is there a compelling reason for this? I tried making all of these behave like the list case and only one test broke (that test being the example above). The test was added in #5880.
