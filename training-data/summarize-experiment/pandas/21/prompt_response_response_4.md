Based on the analysis, the bug occurs due to incorrect conditional checks and handling of different types of input keys within the `_get_with` function. The function fails to accurately determine the type of the input `key` and thus does not properly handle different types of input.

To address this, the conditional logic in the function needs to be revised to accurately classify and handle the different types of input keys, ensuring that each conditional block returns the expected result based on the input type. Furthermore, the implementation of the `self.reindex` method may need review and potential revision to ensure it handles the input `key` correctly.

Here's the corrected function incorporating the necessary changes:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        elif isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.reindex(key)
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected implementation, the conditional logic has been revised to accurately classify and handle the different types of input keys. Additionally, the handling of scalar values has been included to ensure the correct behavior for non-iterable keys.

This revised function should resolve the issues related to key handling and ensure the expected behavior for different types of input keys.
