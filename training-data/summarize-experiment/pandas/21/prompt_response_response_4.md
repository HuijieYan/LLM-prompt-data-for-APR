The bug in the provided `_get_with` function involves incorrect handling of different types of indexers, leading to inconsistent behavior and failure to raise the expected `KeyError`. The function's conditional logic for determining the inferred type of the key is flawed, always resulting in the 'string' type, and leading to incorrect returns and test failures.

The logic of the function should be revised to ensure it correctly identifies the type of the input key and returns the appropriate data from the Series.

To address this bug, the following steps should be taken:
1. Review the conditional logic in the function to accurately determine the inferred type of the key.
2. Investigate the `infer_dtype` and `is_bool_indexer` methods to understand their implementation and ensure they correctly identify the type of the key.
3. Test the function with different types of keys to verify that it consistently returns the expected data and raises the appropriate exceptions when necessary.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

The corrected function ensures that the inferred type of the key is determined accurately, and the appropriate data is returned from the Series based on the input key. The conditional logic has been revised to handle different key types consistently and address the issues that led to the bug.
