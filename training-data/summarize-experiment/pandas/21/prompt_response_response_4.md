Upon analyzing the test cases and their related error messages, it is apparent that the issue lies within the `_get_with` function. The test cases are designed to evaluate the behavior of the `ser` Series when being indexed with different types of indexers, and the expected outcome is a KeyError with a specific message. However, the actual behavior of the function does not align with these expectations, indicating a potential bug in the `_get_with` function.

The bug appears to be related to the inconsistency in handling different types of indexers. Specifically, the function may not correctly identify the type of the input key and, as a result, does not handle it as expected. The function's logic for determining the key type and subsequently selecting the appropriate processing path seems to be the source of the issue.

To address this bug, the `_get_with` function needs to be modified to accurately identify and handle the different types of indexers as intended. This could involve revisiting the conditions for recognizing the key types and ensuring that the function appropriately processes each type of input key, leading to the expected outcomes in the test cases.

Considering the potential approaches for fixing the bug, it is essential to revise the conditional checks for different types of indexers, validate the logic for determining the key type, and ensure that the function handles each type of input key consistently. Additionally, it may be necessary to review the behavior of `ser.loc[key]` and its consistency with the test cases.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if not isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key = list(key)

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the revised version, the conditional checks for different types of indexers have been reviewed and adjusted to ensure consistent handling. The logic for determining the key type has been validated and modified as needed to accurately classify the input key. Overall, the function has been updated to address the identified bug and align with the expected outcomes in the test cases.
