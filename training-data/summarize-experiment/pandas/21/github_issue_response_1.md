Summary:

The issue revolves around the inconsistent behavior of list indexers and array-like indexers in pandas. The user has observed that when using series with list indexers, it leads to a KeyError, while the same operation with array-like indexers or pd.Index does not result in an error. This inconsistency extends to the behavior of `ser.loc[key]`, which raises an error for all 4 cases.

The user questions if there is a specific rationale behind this discrepancy and attempted to make all cases behave like the list case, which only resulted in one test failure. This specific test was added in a previous update (#5880).

The issue is focused on understanding the underlying reasons for this inconsistency, and potentially aligning the behavior of list indexers and array-like indexers to ensure a more consistent and logical operation across all scenarios.
