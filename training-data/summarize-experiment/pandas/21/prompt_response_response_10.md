Based on the analysis of the provided buggy function and the associated test cases, it appears that the issue lies in the inferred type check and the conditional logic based on the type of the input key. The function's conditional checks and type inference are not functioning as expected, leading to incorrect return values and failed test cases.

The reasons behind the bug are related to the flawed logic for determining the inferred type of the key, always resulting in 'string' instead of accurately identifying the type of the key. This leads to incorrect return values from the function, causing the test cases to fail.

To fix the bug, the conditional checks and type inference logic within the function `_get_with` need to be revised and debugged to accurately identify the type of the key and execute the appropriate logic for each type. The inferred type check should be adjusted to correctly identify the type of the key, leading to the appropriate return from the function. Additionally, the conditional statements and their corresponding logic need to be thoroughly reviewed and tested to ensure they handle different types of keys appropriately.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key) and not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In this corrected version, the conditional checks and type inference have been revised to accurately identify the type of the key and execute the appropriate logic for each type. Additionally, the handling of scalar and non-list-like keys has been improved.

This revised version of the function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version to address the identified issue.
