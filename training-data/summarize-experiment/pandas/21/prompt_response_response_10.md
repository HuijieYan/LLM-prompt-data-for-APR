Based on the test case and error message, it seems that the `_get_with` function is not handling non-matching keys correctly, leading to unexpected behavior when the `ser` Series is indexed with such keys. The bug likely originates from the condition `elif not is_list_like(key)` not correctly identifying the type of the input parameter as list-like, leading to incorrect processing of the key.

A possible approach to fixing the bug is to revise the condition `elif not is_list_like(key)` to accurately identify the type of the input parameter as list-like. This would ensure that the function handles non-matching keys correctly and avoids raising unexpected errors.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_with` function:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_list_like(key) or isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

        elif isinstance(key, list):
            return self.loc[key]

        else:
            return self.reindex(key)

    else:
        raise TypeError("Invalid key type")
```

In the corrected code, the condition `elif not is_list_like(key)` is replaced with a combined check for list-like types and specific array-like types. Additionally, an `else` block is added to handle unrecognized key types and raise a `TypeError`. This revised version of the function should resolve the issue by correctly identifying the type of the input parameter and handling non-matching keys appropriately.
