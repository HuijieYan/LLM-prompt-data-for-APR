Based on the analysis of the test case and the provided function, the bug seems to be located in the conditional logic of the `_get_with` function. The function fails to appropriately handle different types of input keys, leading to incorrect behavior and inconsistent results.

The bug occurs due to the inconsistent treatment of different types of indexers, specifically list indexers versus array-like indexers. This inconsistency results in unexpected behavior and error messages when accessing the Series using different types of indexers.

To address this bug, the conditional logic within the `_get_with` function needs to be revised to ensure consistent and proper handling of different types of input keys. Additionally, the behavior of the `reindex` function may need to be reviewed and potentially revised to ensure it handles the input key correctly.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that resolves the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, (ABCDataFrame, ABCSeries)):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame or Series is not supported, use the appropriate DataFrame or Series column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    if is_scalar(key) or not is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Series, Index)):
        key = key.tolist()

    if isinstance(key, (Index, list)):
        if isinstance(key, Index):
            key_type = key.inferred_type
        else:
            key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This revised version of the function provides consistent handling of different types of input keys and ensures that the appropriate actions are taken based on the type of the key. It also addresses the inconsistency in the treatment of list indexers versus array-like indexers. Additionally, it retains the behavior of raising a TypeError when indexing with a DataFrame or Series, as per the original function.

The corrected code can serve as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.
