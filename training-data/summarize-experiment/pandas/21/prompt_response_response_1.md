The bug in the `_get_with` function is related to how it handles different types of `key` inputs. The function contains conditional statements to process the `key` based on its type, but it appears that the logic for determining the inferred type of the `key` is flawed. This leads to incorrect handling of the `key` and results in the function returning unexpected results, causing the test cases to fail.

Upon analyzing the test cases and the error messages, it is evident that the issue lies in the conditional handling of different types of `key` inputs in the `_get_with` function. Specifically, the logic for inferring the type of the `key` is not functioning as expected, leading to discrepancies in the test results.

To address this bug, the logic for inferring the type of the `key` needs to be revised and debugged. Additionally, the conditional handling of different `key` types should be thoroughly reviewed to ensure that the function returns the expected results for all input types.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that resolves the issue:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    # Updated conditional handling for different types of key inputs
    if is_list_like(key):  # Checking if the key is list-like
        key = list(key)
    else:
        key = [key]

    key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)  # Correcting the inference of key type
    
    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if key_type == "string":  # Adjusting the conditional for string type
        return self.reindex(key)

    # Handling unrecognized key types
    raise ValueError("Unsupported key type: {}".format(type(key)))
```

In the corrected version, the conditional handling of different `key` types has been updated to properly infer the type of the `key` and handle it accordingly. This should ensure that the function returns the expected results for various input types and resolves the bug. This revised function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
