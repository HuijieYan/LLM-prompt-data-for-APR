Based on the analysis of the buggy function `_get_with`, the issue lies within the conditional branches that handle different types of input `key`. The function does not accurately classify and handle the different types of input `key`, leading to the execution of the last conditional block and the return of `self.reindex(key)` in all cases.

The error message from the test case, `Failed: DID NOT RAISE <class 'KeyError'>`, indicates that the expected `KeyError` is not being raised for certain types of input `key`, highlighting the inconsistency in the behavior of the function.

To fix the bug:
1. Re-evaluate the conditional logic in the function to accurately classify and handle different types of input `key`.
2. Ensure that each conditional block returns the expected result based on the input type.
3. Review and potentially revise the implementation of `self.reindex` to ensure it handles the input `key` correctly.
4. Consider the relationship between the input key and the function's handling of duplicate indexing.

The corrected code for the `_get_with` function is provided below:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif isinstance(key, Series):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif is_list_like(key) and not is_scalar(key):
        key = list(key)
    elif isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Index)):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.loc[key]
        else:
            return self.iloc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

In the corrected code:
1. The handling of input `key` types has been revised to classify and handle different types accurately.
2. The condition for handling `key` as a Series has been added to return the location of the elements identified by `key`.
3. The condition for checking if `key` is list-like and not a scalar has been added to ensure appropriate handling.
4. The logic for identifying the type of `key` and deciding whether to treat it as a positional indexer or label-based has been revised to address the bug.
5. The handling of duplicate indexing remains consistent with the original implementation.

The revised function provides accurate type classification and handling, ensuring the correct behavior for different types of input `key`. This corrected version can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy function.
