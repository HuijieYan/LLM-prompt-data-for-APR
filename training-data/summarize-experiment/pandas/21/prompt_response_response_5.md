Based on the provided details, the bug in the `_get_with` function occurs due to incorrect handling of different types of input keys. The conditional blocks within the function do not accurately match the types of input keys, leading to the execution of the last conditional block and the return of `self.reindex(key)` in all cases.

To address this issue, the conditional logic in the function needs to be re-evaluated to accurately classify and handle the different types of input keys, ensuring that each conditional block returns the expected result based on the input type. Additionally, the implementation of `self.reindex` may need to be reviewed and potentially revised to ensure it correctly handles the input keys.

To resolve the bug, the following revised code for the `_get_with` function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)
    elif is_list_like(key):
        return self.loc[key]
    elif isinstance(key, (list, np.ndarray, ExtensionArray, Series, Index)):
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)
        if key_type == "integer":
            if not self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
                return self.loc[key]
            else:
                return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.loc[key]
    else:
        return self.reindex(key)
```

This revised version of the function includes updated conditional logic to accurately classify and handle different types of input keys, ensuring the expected behavior for each type. Additionally, the ordering of conditions has been adjusted to prioritize handling specific types before falling back on the general reindexing approach.

By using the corrected `_get_with` function, the issues identified in the test cases and the associated GitHub issue can be addressed, leading to consistent and expected behavior when using different types of indexers with a Series object.
