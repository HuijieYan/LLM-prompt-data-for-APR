Based on the analysis of the provided function and the associated test cases, as well as the runtime variables and expected parameters, the bug in the `_get_with` function is likely caused by the incorrect inference of the type of the input key, which always results in 'string'. This leads to an incorrect return from the function and causes the test cases to fail.

To fix this bug, the conditional block that determines the type of the key and assigns it to `key_type` needs to be revised. The function should correctly infer the type of the input key and then execute the appropriate logic based on that type, ensuring that the returned data matches the expected behavior for different types of keys.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_with` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _get_with(self, key):
    # other: fancy integer or otherwise
    if isinstance(key, slice):
        slobj = self.index._convert_slice_indexer(key, kind="getitem")
        return self._slice(slobj)
    elif isinstance(key, ABCDataFrame):
        raise TypeError(
            "Indexing a Series with DataFrame is not "
            "supported, use the appropriate DataFrame column"
        )
    elif isinstance(key, tuple):
        return self._get_values_tuple(key)

    elif not is_list_like(key) and not isinstance(key, (np.ndarray, Index)):
        return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, Index):
        key_type = key.inferred_type
    else:
        key_type = lib.infer_dtype(key, skipna=False)

    if key_type == "integer":
        if self.index._should_fallback_to_positional():
            return self.iloc[key]
        else:
            return self.loc[key]

    if isinstance(key, list):
        return self.loc[key]

    return self.reindex(key)
```

This corrected version addresses the bug by updating the conditional block that determines the type of the input key and assigns it to `key_type`. It also adjusts the logic to handle different types of keys appropriately, ensuring that the function returns the expected data based on the type of the input key.

This revised function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version to resolve the issue.
