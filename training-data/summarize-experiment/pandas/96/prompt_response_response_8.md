The provided buggy function is trying to adjust a given timestamp based on a set of custom business hours. The issue might lie in one of the conditional blocks or in the calculation and adjustment of business days and remaining hours within the business time intervals.

It seems like the frequency validation is failing with a ValueError. The frequency check is reporting that the "Inferred frequency None from passed values does not conform to passed frequency CBH". This indicates that the bug might be within the frequency validation logic, specifically in the inference process of the frequency. The bug could be related to the DateOffset or CustomBusinessHour classes where the frequency is being misinterpreted or inferred incorrectly.

To fix the bug, you will need to thoroughly investigate the frequency validation related code and any inference mechanisms that exist within the DateOffset and CustomBusinessHour classes. Also, review the implementation and logic around custom business hour handling to provide more insights when fixing the identified bug.

Here's the corrected version of the buggy function:

```python
from datetime import timedelta

class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... (other necessary imports and class code)

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # ... (other function components)

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = CustomBusinessHour(n=bd)  # Fix the instantiation
            # midnight business hour may not on BusinessDay
            if not self.is_on_offset(other):  # Fix the function call
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = (
                    self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                )
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    # go to next business time interval
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if (
                    bhour_remain > bhour
                    or bhour_remain == bhour
                    and nanosecond != 0
                ):
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    # go to next business time interval
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(
                        self._next_opening_time(
                            other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                        )
                    )

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
