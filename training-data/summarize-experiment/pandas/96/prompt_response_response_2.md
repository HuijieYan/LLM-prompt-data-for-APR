The buggy function seems to be attempting to adjust a given timestamp based on a set of custom business hours. The bug could be within the conditional blocks, the calculation and adjustment of business days, or the handling of remaining hours within the business time intervals.

Given the observed error message and the details from the provided test case, it seems that the bug is related to the frequency validation within the `pd.date_range` function when using periods and adding holidays. The issue might stem from the way the frequency is inferred and the conformance check that follows. It's likely that the frequency inference process or the frequency validation logic is causing the mismatch between the inferred and the passed frequency, leading to incorrect output.

To resolve the bug, the frequency validation logic and any inference mechanisms within the `DateOffset` and `CustomBusinessHour` classes need to be carefully reviewed. Additionally, the logic surrounding custom business hour handling should be thoroughly examined for any potential issues related to frequency inference and validation.

Below is the corrected version of the buggy function:

        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:

        businesshours = sum(self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en) for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end))
