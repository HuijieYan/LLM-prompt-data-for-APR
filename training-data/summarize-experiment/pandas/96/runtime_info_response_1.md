In the provided buggy code of the `apply` function, we can see that it takes two parameters, `self` and `other`. `other` is expected to be an instance of the `datetime` class. The function then performs various operations on the `other` parameter and returns the modified value.

To diagnose the issues and understand the buggy behavior, we will analyze the input parameter values and the variable values just before the function returns for each buggy case.

### Buggy case 1
- The input `other` is of type `Timestamp` and has the value `Timestamp('2020-11-25 15:00:00')`.
- After the function execution, `other` is expected to have a value of `datetime.datetime(2020, 11, 27, 16, 0)`.
- Notably, the parameters `self` and `n` are an instance of the class `CustomBusinessHour` and have the values of `<3 * CustomBusinessHours: CBH=15:00-17:00>` and `3` respectively.

### Buggy case 2
- The input `other` is of type `Timestamp` and has the value `Timestamp('2020-11-25 15:00:00')`.
- After the function execution, `other` is expected to have a value of `datetime.datetime(2020, 11, 25, 16, 0)`.
- The parameters `self` and `n` have the values `<CustomBusinessHour: CBH=15:00-17:00>` and `1` respectively.

### Buggy case 3
- The input `other` is of type `Timestamp` and has the value `Timestamp('2020-11-25 16:00:00')`.
- After the function execution, `other` is expected to have a value of `datetime.datetime(2020, 11, 27, 15, 0)`.
- The parameters `self` and `n` have the values `<CustomBusinessHour: CBH=15:00-17:00>` and `1` respectively.

### Buggy case 4
- The input `other` is of type `Timestamp` and has the value `Timestamp('2020-11-27 15:00:00')`.
- After the function execution, `other` is expected to have a value of `datetime.datetime(2020, 11, 27, 16, 0)`.
- The parameters `self` and `n` have the values `<CustomBusinessHour: CBH=15:00-17:00>` and `1` respectively.

### Buggy case 5
- The input `other` is of type `Timestamp` and has the value `Timestamp('2020-11-25 15:00:00', freq='CBH')`.
- After the function execution, `other` is expected to have a value of `Timestamp('2020-11-27 16:00:00')`.
- The parameters `self` and `n` have the values `<3 * CustomBusinessHours: CBH=15:00-17:00>` and `3` respectively.

### Buggy case 6
- The input `other` is of type `Timestamp` and has the value `Timestamp('2020-11-25 15:00:00', freq='CBH')`.
- After the function execution, `other` is expected to have a value of `datetime.datetime(2020, 11, 25, 16, 0)`.
- The parameters `self` and `n` have the values `<CustomBusinessHour: CBH=15:00-17:00>` and `1` respectively.

### Buggy case 7
- The input `other` is of type `Timestamp` and has the value `Timestamp('2020-11-25 16:00:00')`.
- After the function execution, `other` is expected to have a value of `datetime.datetime(2020, 11, 27, 15, 0)`.
- The parameters `self` and `n` have the values `<CustomBusinessHour: CBH=15:00-17:00>` and `1` respectively.

### Buggy case 8
- The input `other` is of type `Timestamp` and has the value `Timestamp('2020-11-27 15:00:00')`.
- After the function execution, `other` is expected to have a value of `datetime.datetime(2020, 11, 27, 16, 0)`.
- The parameters `self` and `n` have the values `<CustomBusinessHour: CBH=15:00-17:00>` and `1` respectively.

By analyzing the provided input values and the changes in variable values before the function return, we can debug and understand the behavior of the buggy `apply` function in different scenarios. It is important to further inspect the logic inside the `apply` function with respect to the observed variable values to identify and fix the bugs.
