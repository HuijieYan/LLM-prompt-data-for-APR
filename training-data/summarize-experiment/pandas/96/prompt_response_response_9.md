The buggy function is the `apply` method, which is intended to apply business hour constraints to a given `datetime` object. However, it appears that the adjustments made within the function are interfering with the frequency validation being performed. This leads to a mismatch between the adjusted dates and the specified frequency, resulting in the propagation of a `ValueError` and ultimately causing a test failure.

It seems that the adjustments and calculations within the function are not consistent with the specified business hour frequency, leading to unexpected behavior and test failures. The issue appears to stem from the handling of business day adjustments, remaining business hours, and the overall adjustment logic for positive offsets.

To resolve this issue, the adjustments and conditional logic within the function need to be thoroughly reviewed and potentially restructured to ensure accurate adjustments based on the specified business hours and provided offsets. Additionally, a review of the business day and business hour handling logic will be crucial to address the inconsistencies and inaccuracies observed in the function's behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function that addresses the aforementioned issues:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if not isinstance(other, datetime):
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
        
    n = self.n
    
    businesshours = sum(
        self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
        for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
    )
    
    bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
    if n < 0:
        bd, r = -bd, -r
    
    adjusted_datetime = other

    if bd != 0:
        skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
        adjusted_datetime = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_datetime)
        if not self._is_on_offset(adjusted_datetime):
            adjusted_datetime = self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_datetime)
            adjusted_datetime = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_datetime)
            adjusted_datetime = self._get_closing_time(adjusted_datetime)
        adjusted_datetime += skip_bd
        
    bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)
    
    if n >= 0:
        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_datetime)) - adjusted_datetime
            if bhour_remain < bhour:
                adjusted_datetime += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                adjusted_datetime = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_datetime + bhour)
    else:
        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            bhour = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_datetime) - adjusted_datetime
            if bhour_remain > bhour:
                adjusted_datetime += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                bhour_remain -= bhour
                adjusted_datetime = self._get_closing_time(
                    self._next_opening_time(
                        adjusted_datetime + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)
                    )
                )

    return adjusted_datetime
```

In this revised version, the adjustment and conditional logic has been reviewed and corrected to ensure accurate adjustments based on the specified business hours and provided offsets. The adjustments based on business days and remaining business hours have been restructured to address the inconsistencies and inaccuracies observed in the original function's behavior. This corrected version should resolve the issues and prevent the propagation of the `ValueError`, ultimately leading to the successful execution of the `apply` function.
