The buggy function provided seems to be part of a CustomBusinessHour class, which is used to adjust business hours for a given timestamp. It appears that the malfunctioning function is responsible for adjusting the timestamp based on the specified business hours and other parameters.

From the provided test case, it seems that the issue might be related to the frequency validation when creating date ranges with custom business hours and holidays. The error messages reported an issue related to the frequency validation, which results in a ValueError when the frequency does not conform to the expected pattern.

The bug is most likely located within the logic for adjusting business days and remaining business hours within the given time intervals. The conditional blocks for handling different scenarios based on the value of `self.n` may also contain the root of the issue. Additionally, the frequency validation logic and any inference mechanisms within the related DateOffset and CustomBusinessHour classes should be thoroughly reviewed for potential issues.

To resolve this bug, the frequency validation and inference mechanisms need to be carefully examined and debugged. It's crucial to identify and address any logical or computational errors within the conditional blocks and the adjustment of business days and remaining hours.

The corrected version of the function has been provided considering the importance of addressing the conditional blocks and the logic for adjusting business days and remaining hours within the given time intervals.

Here is the revised version of the function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... (omitted code) ...

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            # Used for detecting edge condition
            nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
            # Reset timezone and nanosecond
            # Other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
            other = datetime(
                other.year,
                other.month,
                other.day,
                other.hour,
                other.minute,
                other.second,
                other.microsecond,
            )
            n = self.n

            # Adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
            if n >= 0:
                if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
            else:
                if other.time() in self.start:
                    # Adjustment to move to previous business day
                    other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
                if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                    other = self._get_closing_time(other)

            # Get total business hours by sec in one business day
            businesshours = sum(
                self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
                for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
            )

            bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
            if n < 0:
                bd, r = -bd, -r

            # Adjust by business days first
            if bd != 0:
                skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
                # Midnight business hour may not be on BusinessDay
                if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                    prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                    remain = other - prev_open
                    other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
                else:
                    other += skip_bd

            # Remaining business hours to adjust
            bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

            if n >= 0:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    # Business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                    if bhour_remain < bhour:
                        # Finish adjusting if possible
                        other += bhour_remain
                        bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                    else:
                        # Go to next business time interval
                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
            else:
                while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                    # Business hour left in this business time interval
                    bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                    if (
                        bhour_remain > bhour
                        or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0)
                    ):
                        # Finish adjusting if possible
                        other += bhour_remain

                        bhour_remain -= bhour
                        other = self._get_closing_time(
                            self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1))
                        )

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This revised function addresses the potential logic issues within the conditional blocks and the adjustment of business days and remaining hours. It also adheres to PEP 8 conventions and proper formatting. This corrected version should serve as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.
