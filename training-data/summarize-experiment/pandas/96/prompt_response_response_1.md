Based on the analysis, the issue seems to be with the `apply` function, which is not correctly adjusting the input timestamp based on the defined business hours and offset. The conditional blocks for business day adjustments and remaining business hours seem to be prone to errors, resulting in incorrect output.

To resolve this issue, the adjustment and conditional logic in the `apply` function should be thoroughly reviewed and potentially restructured to ensure accurate adjustments based on the specified business hours and provided offsets. Additionally, a review of the business day and business hour handling logic will be crucial to address the inconsistencies and inaccuracies observed in the function's behavior.

Here's the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        adjusted_time = other

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if adjusted_time.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(adjusted_time):
                adjusted_time = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_time)
        else:
            if adjusted_time.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                adjusted_time -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(adjusted_time):
                adjusted_time = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_time)
                adjusted_time = self._get_closing_time(adjusted_time)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            # midnight business hour may not be on BusinessDay
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(adjusted_time):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_time)
                remain = adjusted_time - prev_open
                adjusted_time = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                adjusted_time = adjusted_time + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                # business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = (
                    self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(adjusted_time)) - adjusted_time
                )
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    adjusted_time += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:

        else:

                # business hour left in this business time interval
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(adjusted_time) - adjusted_time
                if (
                    bhour_remain > bhour
                    or bhour_remain == bhour
                ):
                    # finish adjusting if possible
                    adjusted_time += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
