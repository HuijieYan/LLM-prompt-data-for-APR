## Test Functions and Error Messages Summary
The followings are test functions under directory `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py` in the project.
```python
def test_date_range_with_custom_holidays():
    # GH 30593
    freq = pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour(start="15:00", holidays=["2020-11-26"])
    result = pd.date_range(start="2020-11-25 15:00", periods=4, freq=freq)

        ],
        freq=freq,
    )
    tm.assert_index_equal(result, expected)
```

Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:
In reviewing the provided code, we have identified that the function in question, `apply`, is a method intended to apply some business hour constraints to a given `datetime` object. This function iterates through the input date while making adjustments based on specific business hour constraints. However, it seems there are some deficiencies in the implementation which might be leading to unexpected behavior, resulting in the failure of the corresponding test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.

Starting with the test function, we note that it is an instantiation of a `CustomBusinessHour` object, which is a subclass of the `DateOffset` object in pandas. This object specifies a periodic frequency for business hours, and that frequency is configured to represent business hours from 15:00 to 17:00, with an identified holiday on "2020-11-26".

The error message provided is quite detailed and provides a substantial amount of information regarding the point at which the execution has failed. From this message, it is evident that the failure is taking place in methods related to frequency validation for `DatetimeArray` and `CustomBusinessHour`. The failure appears to be related to the "inferred frequency" from passed values not conforming to the passed frequency. This incompatibility appears to be originating from the `_validate_frequency` method, where an attempted comparison of the inferred frequency with the provided frequency leads to a `ValueError`.

Crucially, it seems that the `inferred frequency` is coming out as `None`, and this does not conform to the passed frequency, which is identified as "CBH". This mismatch in frequency results in the propagation of the `ValueError`, ultimately leading to a test failure.

Upon analyzing the function `apply`, it appears that the adjustments made within the function might not be compatible with the frequency validation being performed. Specifically, it adjusts the input date/time based on business hour constraints, possibly leading to a mismatch between the adjusted date and the originally specified frequency.

The adjustments made in the `apply` function indicate a comprehensive manipulation of the input `other` if it is a `datetime` object, based on a variety of conditions. These adjustments involve offset manipulations, including a check for business days, the computation of business hours, and multiple while loops for handling business hour adjustments.

Having established the aforementioned observations, it is clear that the adjustments within the function might be interfering with frequency validation, as the adjusted dates might no longer conform to the initially specified CustomBusinessHour frequency. Consequently, the observed test failure is a direct result of this mismatch between adjusted dates and the frequency constraint that is being imposed.

In conclusion, further steps are required to ensure the adjustments made within the `apply` function remain consistent with the specified business hour frequency and does not hinder the frequency validation logic. Revisiting the requirements and expected behavior of these functions will be essential in resolving the issues pertaining to the failure of the test case. Additional tests and validations that encompass the adjusted dates and take into account the specified frequency will be imperative. Errors related to the propagation of `ValueError` within the frequency validation should be closely examined and suitably handled to ensure that the adjusted dates conform to the specified business hour frequency.



## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

Looking at the buggy code and the variable logs, it seems that the `apply` function is intended to calculate the adjusted datetime based on business hours with some specific offset conditions. However, there seem to be some issues with the adjustments and calculations. Let's analyze the cases where the function exhibited unexpected behavior.

Case 1:

In this case, the initial timestamp `other` is `Timestamp('2020-11-25 15:00:00')` and the adjusted timestamp after the function returns is `Timestamp('2020-11-27 16:00:00')`.

The value of the variable `n` is 3, which indicates a positive offset.

The function is supposed to adjust the provided timestamp based on the business hours defined by `self` (which is an instance of `CustomBusinessHours`). However, it's observable that the adjustment is not applied correctly, leading to the incorrect result.

It seems that the function is incorrectly handling the offset and adjustment logic. Specifically, there seems to be an error in the conditional blocks for adjusting the timestamp based on the offset.

Case 2:

In this case, the initial timestamp `other` is `Timestamp('2020-11-25 15:00:00')` and the adjusted timestamp after the function returns is `datetime.datetime(2020, 11, 25, 16, 0)`.

The value of the variable `n` is 1, which indicates a positive offset.

Similar to the previous case, the function fails to correctly adjust the timestamp according to the offset and defined business hours. The error seems to stem from inconsistencies in handling the business day adjustment and the remaining business hours to adjust.

From the logs, it's evident that the logic for adjusting based on business days and remaining business hours is not working as intended, leading to incorrect results.

Case 3:

The details of this case reveal that the behavior of the function is consistent with the previous cases, displaying a failure to adjust the timestamp as expected based on the provided business hours and offset. The issues with adjustments, especially in scenarios with positive offsets, are indicative of a broader problem in the handling of business day adjustments and remaining business hours.

Case 4:

This case further confirms the inconsistencies in the adjustment logic for positive offsets, as the function once again fails to adjust the timestamp properly, resulting in an incorrect output.

Cases 5, 6, 7, and 8:

An examination of these additional cases reinforces the pattern of the function failing to accurately adjust the timestamp based on positive offsets and defined business hours.

Based on the provided cases, it's evident that there are critical issues with how the function handles adjustments for positive offsets. Specifically, the conditional blocks for business day adjustments and remaining business hours are prone to errors, resulting in incorrect output.

To solve this issue, the function's adjustment and conditional logic need to be thoroughly reviewed and potentially restructured to ensure accurate adjustments based on the specified business hours and provided offsets. Additionally, a review of the business day and business hour handling logic will be crucial to address the inconsistencies and inaccuracies observed in the function's behavior.

Pandas date_range does not work when using periods and adding holiday

              freq=pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour(start='10:00'))
but if I add holidays then it produces more than 14 periods

pd.date_range(start='2020-11-25 10:00',periods=14,
              freq=pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour(start='10:00',holidays=['2020-11-26']))

If I replace periods with the corresponding end then everything works fine.

I am not sure why date_range has this weird behavior. Appreciate any help.
