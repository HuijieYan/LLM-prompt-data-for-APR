## Test Functions and Error Messages Summary
The followings are test functions under directory `pandas/tests/indexes/datetimes/test_date_range.py` in the project.
```python
def test_date_range_with_custom_holidays():
    # GH 30593
    freq = pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour(start="15:00", holidays=["2020-11-26"])
    result = pd.date_range(start="2020-11-25 15:00", periods=4, freq=freq)
    expected = pd.DatetimeIndex(
        [
            "2020-11-25 15:00:00",
            "2020-11-25 16:00:00",
            "2020-11-27 15:00:00",
            "2020-11-27 16:00:00",
        ],
        freq=freq,
    )
    tm.assert_index_equal(result, expected)
```

Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:
The test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is designed to test the `pd.date_range` with custom business hours. The error message indicates that there is a `ValueError` encountered when validating the frequency of the index with a custom business hour frequency. The error message provides a traceback, indicating that the problem occurs during the validation process.

To understand the context of this issue, the following section of the buggy function becomes relevant:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    ...
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n
```
Based on this section, the `apply` function is receiving a `datetime` object called `other`, which is then reset without considering the timezone and nanosecond attributes. This manipulation of the `other` datetime object could potentially lead to inconsistencies in the frequency validation with respect to `CustomBusinessHour` as observed from the error messages.

The next step would be to analyze the test function. In the test function, `pd.date_range` is used to generate a sequence of dates with a custom business hour frequency. This sequence is then compared with `expected` to check if the result matches the expected output. Here's the relevant part of the test function:
```python
def test_date_range_with_custom_holidays():
    ...
        expected = pd.DatetimeIndex(
            [
                "2020-11-25 15:00:00",
                "2020-11-25 16:00:00",
                "2020-11-27 15:00:00",
                "2020-11-27 16:00:00",
            ],
            freq=freq,
        )
    tm.assert_index_equal(result, expected)
```
The test checks if the frequency returned by `pd.date_range` with custom business hours matches the expected frequency. However, the error message indicates that the validation of this frequency results in a `ValueError`.

Based on the error message and the code analysis, the issue is likely due to the `apply` function's manipulation of the `datetime` object `other`, which results in a mismatch with the passed frequency `CBH` (CustomBusinessHour). This mismatch triggers a `ValueError` during the frequency validation process.

To resolve the issue, the `apply` function should be modified to ensure that when resetting the `other` `datetime` object, the timezone and nanosecond attributes are maintained to align with the custom business hour frequency. Additionally, the implementation of the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency needs to be validated against the modified `other` instance to accurately handle scenarios involving custom business hours.



## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

In the provided buggy code of the `apply` function, we can see that it takes two parameters, `self` and `other`. `other` is expected to be an instance of the `datetime` class. The function then performs various operations on the `other` parameter and returns the modified value.

To diagnose the issues and understand the buggy behavior, we will analyze the input parameter values and the variable values just before the function returns for each buggy case.

### Buggy case 1
- The input `other` is of type `Timestamp` and has the value `Timestamp('2020-11-25 15:00:00')`.
- After the function execution, `other` is expected to have a value of `datetime.datetime(2020, 11, 27, 16, 0)`.
- Notably, the parameters `self` and `n` are an instance of the class `CustomBusinessHour` and have the values of `<3 * CustomBusinessHours: CBH=15:00-17:00>` and `3` respectively.

### Buggy case 2
- The input `other` is of type `Timestamp` and has the value `Timestamp('2020-11-25 15:00:00')`.
- After the function execution, `other` is expected to have a value of `datetime.datetime(2020, 11, 25, 16, 0)`.
- The parameters `self` and `n` have the values `<CustomBusinessHour: CBH=15:00-17:00>` and `1` respectively.

### Buggy case 3
- The input `other` is of type `Timestamp` and has the value `Timestamp('2020-11-25 16:00:00')`.
- After the function execution, `other` is expected to have a value of `datetime.datetime(2020, 11, 27, 15, 0)`.
- The parameters `self` and `n` have the values `<CustomBusinessHour: CBH=15:00-17:00>` and `1` respectively.

### Buggy case 4
- The input `other` is of type `Timestamp` and has the value `Timestamp('2020-11-27 15:00:00')`.
- After the function execution, `other` is expected to have a value of `datetime.datetime(2020, 11, 27, 16, 0)`.
- The parameters `self` and `n` have the values `<CustomBusinessHour: CBH=15:00-17:00>` and `1` respectively.

### Buggy case 5
- The input `other` is of type `Timestamp` and has the value `Timestamp('2020-11-25 15:00:00', freq='CBH')`.
- After the function execution, `other` is expected to have a value of `Timestamp('2020-11-27 16:00:00')`.
- The parameters `self` and `n` have the values `<3 * CustomBusinessHours: CBH=15:00-17:00>` and `3` respectively.

- The parameters `self` and `n` have the values `<CustomBusinessHour: CBH=15:00-17:00>` and `1` respectively.

### Buggy case 7
- The input `other` is of type `Timestamp` and has the value `Timestamp('2020-11-25 16:00:00')`.
- After the function execution, `other` is expected to have a value of `datetime.datetime(2020, 11, 27, 15, 0)`.
- The parameters `self` and `n` have the values `<CustomBusinessHour: CBH=15:00-17:00>` and `1` respectively.

### Buggy case 8
- The input `other` is of type `Timestamp` and has the value `Timestamp('2020-11-27 15:00:00')`.
- After the function execution, `other` is expected to have a value of `datetime.datetime(2020, 11, 27, 16, 0)`.
- The parameters `self` and `n` have the values `<CustomBusinessHour: CBH=15:00-17:00>` and `1` respectively.

By analyzing the provided input values and the changes in variable values before the function return, we can debug and understand the behavior of the buggy `apply` function in different scenarios. It is important to further inspect the logic inside the `apply` function with respect to the observed variable values to identify and fix the bugs.



## Summary of the GitHub Issue Related to the Bug

Summary:
The issue describes a problem with the `pd.date_range` function in Pandas when using custom business hours and adding holidays. When using the `pd.date_range` function with a specified start date, number of periods, custom business hour frequency, and holidays, the output includes more periods than specified. The example provided demonstrates that when holidays are added, the function produces an unexpected result with more periods than specified. However, when using the corresponding end date instead of periods, the function works fine. The user is seeking help to understand and resolve this unexpected behavior.
