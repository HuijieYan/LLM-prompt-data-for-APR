Please correct the malfunctioning function provided below by using the relevant information listed to address this bug. Then, produce a revised version of the function that resolves the issue. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python

from pandas._libs.tslibs.offsets import ApplyTypeError, BaseOffset, _get_calendar, _is_normalized, _to_dt64, apply_index_wraps, as_datetime, roll_yearday, shift_month

## Test Case Summary
The provided test_date_range_with_custom_holidays() test function seems to be used to test the functionality of creating date ranges with custom business hours and holidays. The method instantiates a CustomBusinessHour object with a start of "15:00" and specifies a holiday for a specific date. Then, it creates a date range that starts at "2020-11-25 15:00" and has a frequency of the previously instantiated CustomBusinessHour object. The expected result is a DatetimeIndex with the corresponding dates and times based on the provided parameters.

The error messages reported an issue related to the frequency validation. It seems like the frequency check failed with a ValueError. Specifically, the ValueError is related to the frequency's conformance. The message provided in the error clearly states that the "Inferred frequency None from passed values does not conform to passed frequency CBH".

This infers that the bug is likely within the frequency validation logic. The location of the bug is identified on line 286 of pandas/core/indexes/datetimes.py, where the _validate_frequency() method is called. Within that method, the bug is identified specifically on line 419 of pandas/core/arrays/datetimes.py, when the cls._validate_frequency() method is called and the ValueError is raised.

The key part of the bug might be the way the frequency is inferred and the conformance check that follows. There seems to be an issue with the inference of the frequency, leading to a mismatch between the inferred and the passed frequency. Therefore, the root issue causing the test to fail is likely within the method apply() as examples of merged holiday dates typically require complex logic to handle. However, the exact fix would require further examination of the logic involving the frequency validation and the inference process. The bug may also lie within the DateOffset or CustomBusinessHour classes where the frequency is being misinterpreted or inferred incorrectly.

To tackle this issue, one should thoroughly investigate the frequency validation related code and any inference mechanisms that exist within the DateOffset and CustomBusinessHour classes. Additionally, reviewing the implementation and logic around custom business hour handling may provide more insights when fixing the identified bug.



## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

From the provided buggy function code and the variable logs, it appears that the function is attempting to adjust business hours for a given timestamp. There are several components in the function that handle different cases and adjust the timestamp accordingly.

Let's break down the components that seem most relevant to the observed variable values:
1. The components for adjusting the timestamp based on business days and remaining business hours:
    - `bd` and `r` are derived from the value of `self.n`, which represents the number of business hours to adjust the timestamp by.
    - The `skip_bd` custom business day object seems to be used to skip business days when adjusting the timestamp.
    - The variables `bhour_remain` and `bhour` seem to be used to adjust the remaining hours within the business time intervals.

2. The conditional blocks for handling different scenarios depending on the value of `self.n`:
    - The conditional blocks that check if `n` is greater than or equal to 0 or less than 0 seem to be deciding which sub-blocks of code are executed to handle adjustments to the timestamp.

Based on these preliminary observations, it seems that the buggy function is trying to adjust a given timestamp based on a set of custom business hours. The issue might lie in one of the conditional blocks or in the calculation and adjustment of business days and remaining hours within the business time intervals.

Further analysis and debugging would involve carefully examining these components in the code to identify any logical or computational errors that could be causing the function to produce incorrect output. Additionally, tracing through the code based on the provided variable logs for each buggy case will help in identifying which specific parts of the function are responsible for the incorrect output.



# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
Pandas date_range does not work when using periods and adding holiday
```

## The associated detailed issue description
```text
This code works fine

pd.date_range(start='2020-11-25 10:00',periods=14,
              freq=pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour(start='10:00'))
but if I add holidays then it produces more than 14 periods

pd.date_range(start='2020-11-25 10:00',periods=14,
              freq=pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour(start='10:00',holidays=['2020-11-26']))
Output:

DatetimeIndex(['2020-11-25 10:00:00', '2020-11-25 11:00:00',
               '2020-11-25 12:00:00', '2020-11-25 13:00:00',
               '2020-11-25 14:00:00', '2020-11-25 15:00:00',
               '2020-11-25 16:00:00', '2020-11-27 10:00:00',
               '2020-11-27 11:00:00', '2020-11-27 12:00:00',
               '2020-11-27 13:00:00', '2020-11-27 14:00:00',
               '2020-11-27 15:00:00', '2020-11-27 16:00:00',
               '2020-11-30 10:00:00', '2020-11-30 11:00:00',
               '2020-11-30 12:00:00', '2020-11-30 13:00:00',
               '2020-11-30 14:00:00', '2020-11-30 15:00:00',
               '2020-11-30 16:00:00', '2020-12-01 10:00:00',
               '2020-12-01 11:00:00', '2020-12-01 12:00:00',
               '2020-12-01 13:00:00', '2020-12-01 14:00:00',
               '2020-12-01 15:00:00', '2020-12-01 16:00:00',
               '2020-12-02 10:00:00', '2020-12-02 11:00:00',
               '2020-12-02 12:00:00'],
              dtype='datetime64[ns]', freq='CBH')
If I replace periods with the corresponding end then everything works fine.

pd.date_range(start='2020-11-25 10:00',end='2020-11-27 16:00:00',
              freq=pd.offsets.CustomBusinessHour(start='10:00',holidays=['2020-11-26']))
I am not sure why date_range has this weird behavior. Appreciate any help.
