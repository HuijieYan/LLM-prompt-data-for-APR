The potential error location within the buggy function is likely related to the logic for adjusting the timestamp based on the number of business hours (`self.n`). There might be issues with the conditional blocks and the calculation of business days and remaining hours within the business time intervals. Additionally, the method might not be handling the presence of holidays correctly, leading to unexpected behavior when generating date ranges.

The bug occurs due to the interaction between the date_range function and the CustomBusinessHour frequency, especially when holidays are introduced. The frequency validation seems to fail, leading to a mismatch between the inferred frequency and the passed frequency. This results in unexpected output when using periods with the CustomBusinessHour and adding holidays.

To fix the bug, the logic for adjusting the timestamp based on business days and remaining business hours needs to be thoroughly reviewed. Additionally, the handling of holidays within the date_range function and the frequency validation mechanism should be carefully examined. Addressing these areas may help resolve the bug and ensure that the date_range function works as expected when using periods with the CustomBusinessHour frequency and adding holidays.

Below is the revised version of the function that resolves the issue:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from pandas.tseries.offsets import ApplyTypeError, CustomBusinessHour
import pandas as pd

class CustomBusinessHour(CustomBusinessHour):

    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            if self.holidays is not None and other in self.holidays:
                raise ApplyTypeError("Specified holiday date")
            
            n = self.n
            businesshour = timedelta(hours=1)

            if n > 0:
                while n >= businesshour:
                    other += businesshour
                    n -= businesshour
                    while other.weekday() > 4 or other in self.holidays:
                        other += timedelta(days=1)
            else:
                n = -n
                while n >= businesshour:
                    other -= businesshour
                    n -= businesshour
                    while other.weekday() > 4 or other in self.holidays:
                        other -= timedelta(days=1)
            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")

# Test the revised code
holidays = [datetime(2020, 11, 26)]
custom_bh = CustomBusinessHour(start='10:00', holidays=holidays)

print(pd.date_range(start='2020-11-25 10:00', periods=14, freq=custom_bh))
```

In this revised code:
1. The logic for adjusting the timestamp based on business days and remaining business hours has been simplified and refined.
2. The presence of holidays is now directly checked within the `apply` method and raises an error if the timestamp falls on a holiday.
3. The adjustment process now considers holidays and skips them while adjusting the timestamp.

This revised code should address the bug and allow the date_range function to work correctly when using periods with the CustomBusinessHour frequency and adding holidays.
