Based on the given information and analysis, the buggy function `apply` is causing inconsistencies in validating the frequency with respect to `CustomBusinessHour`, resulting in a `ValueError` during the frequency validation process. The issue stems from the manipulation of the `other` datetime object without considering the timezone and nanosecond attributes, which mismatches the custom business hour frequency.

To address this issue, the `apply` function needs to be modified to ensure that when resetting the `other` datetime object, the timezone and nanosecond attributes are maintained to align with the custom business hour frequency. Additionally, the implementation of the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency needs to be validated against the modified `other` instance to accurately handle scenarios involving custom business hours.

Based on the identified issue and the nature of the bug, below is the corrected version of the `apply` function:

```python
class BusinessHourMixin(BusinessMixin):
    # ... omitted code ...

    @apply_wraps
    def apply(self, other):
        if isinstance(other, datetime):
            n = self.n

            # Adjust the time while preserving timezone and nanosecond
            other = other.replace(hour=0, minute=0, second=0, microsecond=0)

            # Reset other to the start of the business hour
            other = self._next_opening_time(other)

            # Skip business days if necessary
            business_days_to_skip = n // 9 if n >= 0 else -((-n) // 9)

            # Move to the next business day if not on the offset
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other + timedelta(days=1))

            # Adjust for skipped business days
            other += timedelta(days=business_days_to_skip)

            # Calculate remaining business hours
            remaining_hours = n % 9 * 60

            # Adjust by remaining business hours
            while remaining_hours > 0:
                closing_time = self._get_closing_time(other)
                time_till_closing = closing_time - other

                if remaining_hours < time_till_closing.seconds // 60:
                    other += timedelta(minutes=remaining_hours)
                    remaining_hours = 0
                else:
                    remaining_hours -= time_till_closing.seconds // 60
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + time_till_closing)

            return other
        else:
            raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

In the corrected version of the `apply` function:
- The `other` datetime object is adjusted to the start of the business hour while preserving its timezone and nanosecond attributes.
- Business days are skipped based on the value of `n` to account for skipped business hours.
- Remaining business hours are computed and adjusted properly within the business time intervals.

This corrected version of the `apply` function should resolve the bug by ensuring proper alignment with the custom business hour frequency and the handling of scenarios involving different business hour increments.
