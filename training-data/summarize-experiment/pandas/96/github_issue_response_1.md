Summary:
The issue describes a problem with the `pd.date_range` function in Pandas when using custom business hours and adding holidays. When using the `pd.date_range` function with a specified start date, number of periods, custom business hour frequency, and holidays, the output includes more periods than specified. The example provided demonstrates that when holidays are added, the function produces an unexpected result with more periods than specified. However, when using the corresponding end date instead of periods, the function works fine. The user is seeking help to understand and resolve this unexpected behavior.
