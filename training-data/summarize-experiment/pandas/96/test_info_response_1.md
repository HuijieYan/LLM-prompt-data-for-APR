In reviewing the provided code, we have identified that the function in question, `apply`, is a method intended to apply some business hour constraints to a given `datetime` object. This function iterates through the input date while making adjustments based on specific business hour constraints. However, it seems there are some deficiencies in the implementation which might be leading to unexpected behavior, resulting in the failure of the corresponding test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays`.

Starting with the test function, we note that it is an instantiation of a `CustomBusinessHour` object, which is a subclass of the `DateOffset` object in pandas. This object specifies a periodic frequency for business hours, and that frequency is configured to represent business hours from 15:00 to 17:00, with an identified holiday on "2020-11-26".

The error message provided is quite detailed and provides a substantial amount of information regarding the point at which the execution has failed. From this message, it is evident that the failure is taking place in methods related to frequency validation for `DatetimeArray` and `CustomBusinessHour`. The failure appears to be related to the "inferred frequency" from passed values not conforming to the passed frequency. This incompatibility appears to be originating from the `_validate_frequency` method, where an attempted comparison of the inferred frequency with the provided frequency leads to a `ValueError`.

Crucially, it seems that the `inferred frequency` is coming out as `None`, and this does not conform to the passed frequency, which is identified as "CBH". This mismatch in frequency results in the propagation of the `ValueError`, ultimately leading to a test failure.

Upon analyzing the function `apply`, it appears that the adjustments made within the function might not be compatible with the frequency validation being performed. Specifically, it adjusts the input date/time based on business hour constraints, possibly leading to a mismatch between the adjusted date and the originally specified frequency.

The adjustments made in the `apply` function indicate a comprehensive manipulation of the input `other` if it is a `datetime` object, based on a variety of conditions. These adjustments involve offset manipulations, including a check for business days, the computation of business hours, and multiple while loops for handling business hour adjustments.

Having established the aforementioned observations, it is clear that the adjustments within the function might be interfering with frequency validation, as the adjusted dates might no longer conform to the initially specified CustomBusinessHour frequency. Consequently, the observed test failure is a direct result of this mismatch between adjusted dates and the frequency constraint that is being imposed.

In conclusion, further steps are required to ensure the adjustments made within the `apply` function remain consistent with the specified business hour frequency and does not hinder the frequency validation logic. Revisiting the requirements and expected behavior of these functions will be essential in resolving the issues pertaining to the failure of the test case. Additional tests and validations that encompass the adjusted dates and take into account the specified frequency will be imperative. Errors related to the propagation of `ValueError` within the frequency validation should be closely examined and suitably handled to ensure that the adjusted dates conform to the specified business hour frequency.
