The test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is designed to test the `pd.date_range` with custom business hours. The error message indicates that there is a `ValueError` encountered when validating the frequency of the index with a custom business hour frequency. The error message provides a traceback, indicating that the problem occurs during the validation process.

To understand the context of this issue, the following section of the buggy function becomes relevant:
```python
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    ...
        # reset timezone and nanosecond
        # other may be a Timestamp, thus not use replace
        other = datetime(
            other.year,
            other.month,
            other.day,
            other.hour,
            other.minute,
            other.second,
            other.microsecond,
        )
        n = self.n
```
Based on this section, the `apply` function is receiving a `datetime` object called `other`, which is then reset without considering the timezone and nanosecond attributes. This manipulation of the `other` datetime object could potentially lead to inconsistencies in the frequency validation with respect to `CustomBusinessHour` as observed from the error messages.

The next step would be to analyze the test function. In the test function, `pd.date_range` is used to generate a sequence of dates with a custom business hour frequency. This sequence is then compared with `expected` to check if the result matches the expected output. Here's the relevant part of the test function:
```python
def test_date_range_with_custom_holidays():
    ...
        expected = pd.DatetimeIndex(
            [
                "2020-11-25 15:00:00",
                "2020-11-25 16:00:00",
                "2020-11-27 15:00:00",
                "2020-11-27 16:00:00",
            ],
            freq=freq,
        )
    tm.assert_index_equal(result, expected)
```
The test checks if the frequency returned by `pd.date_range` with custom business hours matches the expected frequency. However, the error message indicates that the validation of this frequency results in a `ValueError`.

Based on the error message and the code analysis, the issue is likely due to the `apply` function's manipulation of the `datetime` object `other`, which results in a mismatch with the passed frequency `CBH` (CustomBusinessHour). This mismatch triggers a `ValueError` during the frequency validation process.

To resolve the issue, the `apply` function should be modified to ensure that when resetting the `other` `datetime` object, the timezone and nanosecond attributes are maintained to align with the custom business hour frequency. Additionally, the implementation of the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency needs to be validated against the modified `other` instance to accurately handle scenarios involving custom business hours.
