The issue that needs to be addressed is related to the error message and the conditional structure in the `pivot` function. The `test_pivot_columns_none_raise_error` test function checks if the `pivot` method raises a `TypeError` with the message "pivot() missing 1 required argument: 'columns'" when the `columns` argument is not provided. However, the current behavior does not align with this expectation, and it instead raises a KeyError with a confusing error message, "None of [None] are in the columns".

The problematic section within the `pivot` function is likely related to the conditional structure and variable handling when `values` is provided. The conditional structure needs to be clearer and the flow between `index`, `columns`, and `values` must be properly handled to avoid the KeyError when trying to access `data[columns]` in the `MultiIndex.from_arrays` call.

To address this, it is recommended to review the conditional branching within the `pivot` function and ensure that the handling of `values`, `index`, and `columns` is consistent and correct. This may involve clearer logic for handling cases where `values` is not None and better interactions between the `index`, `columns`, and `values` flow. It would also be beneficial to update the error message to inform users that the `columns` argument is required.

Here is the corrected version of the `pivot` function:

```python
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot"], indents=1)
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if columns is None:
        raise TypeError("pivot() missing 1 required argument: 'columns'")

    if values is None:
        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.set_index(cols, append=append)
    else:
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        else:
            index = data[index]
        index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])

        if is_list_like(values) and not isinstance(values, tuple):
            # Exclude tuple because it is seen as a single column name
            indexed = data._constructor(
                data[values].values, index=index, columns=values
            )
        else:
            indexed = data._constructor_sliced(data[values].values, index=index)
    return indexed.unstack(columns)
``` 

In this corrected version, an explicit check for `None` value for `columns` is added, and a `TypeError` is raised if it is not provided. The rest of the logic remains intact. With this correction, the `pivot` function should now raise the expected `TypeError` with the correct message when the `columns` argument is not provided.
