Based on the test case and associated error message, the bug is occurring when the `columns` argument is set to `None` in the `pivot` method of the `pandas` module. The error message indicates that the expected behavior is to raise a `TypeError` with the message "pivot() missing 1 required argument: 'columns'", but instead, a `KeyError` is being raised.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the conditional structure and variable assignments where the `index` and `columns` arguments are handled. Specifically, the issue may arise when `values` is not None and the `index` and `columns` are not explicitly provided.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the conditional structure in the `pivot` function is unclear when `values` is not None. This leads to incorrect handling of the `index` variable, which causes a `KeyError` when trying to access the `data[columns]` in the `MultiIndex.from_arrays` call.

To fix the bug, the conditional structure and variable assignments in the `pivot` function need to be modified to provide clearer logic for handling cases where `values` is not None. Additionally, better interactions between the `index`, `columns`, and `values` flow need to be established to ensure correct variable assignments and prevent the occurrence of a `KeyError`.

Here's the corrected code for the `pivot` function:

```python
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot"], indents=1)
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if values is None:
        if columns is None:
            raise TypeError("pivot() missing 1 required argument: 'columns'")
        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.set_index(cols, append=append)
    else:
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        else:
            index = data[index]
        index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])

        if is_list_like(values) and not isinstance(values, tuple):
            # Exclude tuple because it is seen as a single column name
            indexed = data._constructor(
                data[values].values, index=index, columns=values
            )
        else:
            indexed = data._constructor_sliced(data[values].values, index=index)
    return indexed.unstack(columns)
``` 

This revised version of the `pivot` function includes an additional check to raise a `TypeError` if the `columns` argument is None when `values` are also None. This ensures that the required argument 'columns' is not missing and aligns with the expected behavior outlined in the error message.
