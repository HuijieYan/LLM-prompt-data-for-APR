The error message indicates that a `KeyError` occurred in the `pandas/_libs/index.pyx:136` file, precisely at the line `return self.mapping.get_item(val)`. Additionally, it states that a `KeyError: None` exception occurred at `pandas/_libs/hashtable_class_helper.pxi:1622`.

From the test function `test_pivot_columns_none_raise_error` under the `test_pivot.py` file, we gather that it is aimed at testing the behavior of the `pivot` function when the `columns` argument is set to `None`. This is evident from the fact that the `pivot` function is invoked with `columns=None` as seen in the `df.pivot(index="col1", values="col3")` line in the test case. The function is expected to raise a `TypeError` with a message indicating that the 'columns' argument is missing.

However, the error message returned is not a `TypeError` as expected from the test case, but rather a `KeyError` for `None` which can be traced back to the `pandas/core/reshape/pivot.py` file and its corresponding line where `MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])` is invoked, based on the stack trace included in the error message.

The crucial discrepancy lies in the fact that the error indicates a `KeyError: None` stemming from the `get_item` method of the `pandas/_libs/hashtable_class_helper` class, whereas the test case was intended to trigger a `TypeError` based on a missing 'columns' argument. This points to the understanding that the issue is not necessarily with the misinterpretation of the test result, but rather an underlying bug within the `pivot` function itself.

Therefore, the cause of the error and the root of this bug likely originate from the incorrect handling of `None` or missing values being passed to the `columns` parameter within the `pivot` function. The incorrect handling would then lead to an unintended exception, causing the test to fail and the code to raise a `KeyError` exception. Hence, the root cause of the bug in the `pivot` function should be thoroughly investigated and corrected.
