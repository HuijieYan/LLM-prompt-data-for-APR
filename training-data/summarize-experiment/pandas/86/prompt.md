Please correct the malfunctioning function provided below by using the relevant information listed to address this bug. Then, produce a revised version of the function that resolves the issue. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
from pandas.util._decorators import Appender, Substitution
from pandas.core.dtypes.common import is_integer_dtype, is_list_like, is_scalar
from pandas.core.frame import _shared_docs
from pandas.core.indexes.api import Index, MultiIndex, get_objs_combined_axis
```

The following is the buggy function that you need to fix:
```python
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot"], indents=1)
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if values is None:
        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.set_index(cols, append=append)
    else:
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        else:
            index = data[index]
        index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])

        if is_list_like(values) and not isinstance(values, tuple):
            # Exclude tuple because it is seen as a single column name
            indexed = data._constructor(
                data[values].values, index=index, columns=values
            )
        else:
            indexed = data._constructor_sliced(data[values].values, index=index)
    return indexed.unstack(columns)
```



## Test Functions and Error Messages Summary
The followings are test functions under directory `pandas/tests/reshape/test_pivot.py` in the project.
```python
def test_pivot_columns_none_raise_error(self):
    # GH 30924
    df = pd.DataFrame(
        {"col1": ["a", "b", "c"], "col2": [1, 2, 3], "col3": [1, 2, 3]}
    )
    msg = r"pivot\(\) missing 1 required argument: 'columns'"
    with pytest.raises(TypeError, match=msg):
        df.pivot(index="col1", values="col3")
```

Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:
This error message is crucial in diagnosing the issues present in the `pivot` function in the `pandas` module.

Firstly, let's break down the test function. The `test_pivot_columns_none_raise_error` function is used for testing the pivot method under specific conditions. In this case, the method is tested with a DataFrame `df` that contains the columns 'col1', 'col2', and 'col3'. The pivot method is called on `df` with the `index` argument set to "col1" and the `values` argument set to "col3". According to the error message, the expected outcome is a `TypeError` with the message "pivot() missing 1 required argument: 'columns'". This indicates that the `pivot` method is expected to raise an exception if the `columns` argument is not provided.

Moving to the actual error message, it is important to note that the error occurs in the `pivot` method at line 441 of the pivot.py file. Specifically, the issue arises when `index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])` is executed. Looking further into the error traceback, it is revealed that the exception is related to `KeyError: None` within the `pandas/_libs` and `pandas/core` files. This points to an issue with key indexing and implies that the `columns` argument is unable to be located or is identified as `None`.

Now, going back to the `pivot` function code provided at the beginning, the way the `index` and `columns` arguments are being handled may be the cause of the failure. The `pivot` function has conditional branches checking for `index` and `columns`, and in the case where `index` is provided, it uses `data[index]` to assign to `index`. However, if `values` is also provided, the conditional structure seems to be unclear, and it may be setting the `index` variable incorrectly leading to the KeyError when trying to access the `data[columns]` in the `MultiIndex.from_arrays` call.

To address the issue, modifications to the conditional structure and variable assignments in the `pivot` function may be necessary. This could involve clearer logic for handling cases where `values` is not None and better interactions between the `index`, `columns`, and `values` flow. The error message and the test function play a crucial role in identifying the problem and possible resolution paths for the issue.



# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
BUG: Wrong error message is raised when columns=None in df.pivot
```

## The associated detailed issue description
```text
From docstring, index and values can be optional in df.pivot, but columns is not

https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.DataFrame.pivot.html
index : string or object, optional
Column to use to make new frame’s index. If None, uses existing index.

columns : string or object
Column to use to make new frame’s columns.

However, the error message is confusing now, should raise columns is not optional.

Code example:
>>> df = pd.DataFrame({"foo": ['one', 'one', 'two', 'two'],"bar": ['A', 'A', 'B', 'C'],"baz": [1, 2, 3, 4]})
>>> df.pivot(columns=None)

KeyError: 'None of [None] are in the columns'
```
