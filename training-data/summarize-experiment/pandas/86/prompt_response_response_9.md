Based on the provided information, it seems that the issue is related to the `pivot` function in the pandas module, specifically when the `columns` argument is set to None. The test case `test_pivot_columns_none_raise_error` indicates that the `pivot` method should raise a `TypeError` with the message "pivot() missing 1 required argument: 'columns'" when the `columns` argument is not provided.

The error occurs in the `pivot` function at the line `index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])` and the traceback indicates a `KeyError: None` related to the handling of the `columns` argument.

To address this issue, the conditional structure and variable assignments in the `pivot` function need to be examined. The resolution may involve clearer logic for handling cases where `values` is not None and better interactions between the `index`, `columns`, and `values` flow.

Here is a possible approach for fixing the bug:
- Revise the conditional structure to ensure that when `columns` is None, a `TypeError` is raised indicating that `columns` is a required argument.
- Update the variable assignments to handle cases where `values` is not None and ensure that the interaction between `index`, `columns`, and `values` is correctly handled.

The corrected code for the `pivot` function is as follows:

```python
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot"], indents=1)
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if columns is None:
        raise TypeError("pivot() missing 1 required argument: 'columns'")
    
    if values is None:
        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.set_index(cols, append=append)
    else:
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        else:
            index = data[index]
        index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])

        if is_list_like(values) and not isinstance(values, tuple):
            # Exclude tuple because it is seen as a single column name
            indexed = data._constructor(
                data[values].values, index=index, columns=values
            )
        else:
            indexed = data._constructor_sliced(data[values].values, index=index)
    return indexed.unstack(columns)
```

This corrected code provides a clear validation for the `columns` argument and ensures that it is handled appropriately when `None`. Additionally, the conditional structure and variable assignments have been revised to ensure correct handling of `values` in relation to `index` and `columns`. This revised version should resolve the issue and align with the expected behavior indicated by the test case and error message.
