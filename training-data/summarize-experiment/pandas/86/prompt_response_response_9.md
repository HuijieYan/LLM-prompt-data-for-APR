Based on the analysis of the test function and the runtime variables in the buggy `pivot` function, as well as the reported GitHub issue, it is evident that the bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the `columns` parameter being set to None. This results in a misleading error message and does not accurately convey that the 'columns' parameter is mandatory.

To fix this bug, the 'pivot' function needs to be modified to explicitly check for the presence of the 'columns' parameter and raise a TypeError if it is missing. Additionally, the error message raised in this scenario should be updated to clearly indicate that the 'columns' parameter is required.

Here is the corrected version of the 'pivot' function:

```python
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot"], indents=1)
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if columns is None:
        raise TypeError("pivot() missing 1 required argument: 'columns'")
    
    if values is None:
        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.set_index(cols, append=append)
    else:
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        else:
            index = data[index]
        index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])

        if is_list_like(values) and not isinstance(values, tuple):
            # Exclude tuple because it is seen as a single column name
            indexed = data._constructor(
                data[values].values, index=index, columns=values
            )
        else:
            indexed = data._constructor_sliced(data[values].values, index=index)
    return indexed.unstack(columns)
```

In this corrected code, an additional check has been included to verify the presence of the 'columns' parameter. If it is found to be None, a TypeError is raised with a clear and informative message. This addresses the core issue identified in the bug.

This revised 'pivot' function can now serve as a drop-in replacement for the previous buggy version, resolving the issue and providing a more user-friendly experience when using the function.
