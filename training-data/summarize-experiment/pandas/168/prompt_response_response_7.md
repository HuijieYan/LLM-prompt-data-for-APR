Based on the analysis, it appears that the issue lies within the logic of how the 'key' parameter is processed in the _get_grouper function. The unnecessary conversion of a string key to a list might be the root cause of the KeyError.

To resolve the bug, the function logic related to the handling and processing of the 'key' variable should be reviewed and streamlined. Additionally, the logic governing the evaluation of the flags such as `is_tuple`, `match_axis_length`, `any_callable`, `any_groupers`, `any_arraylike` should be thoroughly examined.

Potential approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Simplifying the processing of the 'key' variable to avoid unnecessary conversions.
2. Ensuring consistent and accurate evaluation of flags to reflect the intended behavior.

Here is the corrected version of the _get_grouper function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if level is not None:
        # Simplified logic for handling level
        if isinstance(group_axis, MultiIndex):
            if is_list_like(level):
                level = level[0]
            if key is None:
                key = group_axis.get_level_values(level)
                level = None
        else:
            if is_list_like(level):
                nlevels = len(level)
                if nlevels == 1:
                    level = level[0]
                elif nlevels == 0:
                    raise ValueError("No group keys passed!")
                else:
                    raise ValueError("multiple levels only valid with MultiIndex")

            if isinstance(level, str) and obj.index.name != level:
                raise ValueError(
                    "level name {} is not the name of the index".format(level)
                )
            elif level > 0 or level < -1:
                raise ValueError("level > 0 or level < -1 only valid with MultiIndex")

            level = None
            key = group_axis

    # ... (existing logic for Grouper and BaseGrouper)

    if not isinstance(key, list):
        keys = [key]
        match_axis_length = False
    else:
        keys = key
        match_axis_length = len(keys) == len(group_axis)

    # Simplified logic for evaluating flags
    any_callable = any(callable(g) or isinstance(g, dict) for g in keys)
    any_groupers = any(isinstance(g, Grouper) for g in keys)
    any_arraylike = any(
        isinstance(g, (list, tuple, Series, Index, np.ndarray)) for g in keys
    )

    # ... (remaining logic)

    # Corrected internals grouper creation
    grouper = BaseGrouper(group_axis, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

By simplifying the processing of the 'key' variable and ensuring consistent flag evaluations, the fixed version of the _get_grouper function aims to address the identified bug.
