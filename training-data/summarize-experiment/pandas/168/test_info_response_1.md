The key information about the bug in the `_get_grouper` function and the corresponding test case is as follows:

From the test case, the following information is revealed:
- The test function test_groupby_axis_1 is described in the error message.
- It is being tested with input `group_name = ['x']`.
- The main operation being run is `df.groupby(group_name, axis=1).sum()`.

From the error message, the following information can be derived:
- It explains that a KeyError occurred in the `df.groupby(group_name, axis=1).sum()` operation.
- The location where the error occurred is specified as line 615 in the `pandas/core/groupby/grouper.py` file.

In addition, the error message provides a traceback of the function call stack:
```
File "pandas/tests/groupby/test_groupby.py", line 1874, in test_groupby_axis_1
```
This indicates the location in the test file where the error occurred, providing a reference to the specific test function that triggers the error.

Now, to dive deeper into the specifics of the error: 
- The error message indicates that a `KeyError` was raised.
- The key causing the error is identified as 'x'.
- This `KeyError` is raised at line 615 of `pandas/core/groupby/grouper.py`.

The key 'x' causing the `KeyError` suggests that there is an issue with the 'x' key when it is passed to the `groupby` function. The source of the problem is obscure and requires further investigation into the implementation of the `_get_grouper` function and how the 'x' key is being handled by the `groupby` operation, potentially in relation to the axis specified.

To resolve the bug, a detailed analysis of the `_get_grouper` function is needed to understand the handling of the key and its relation to the `groupby` operation with a focus on the axis specified. Additionally, the `groupby` implementation in `pandas/core/groupby/grouper.py` where the `KeyError` occurs in line 615 will need to be examined to determine how the 'x' key is being processed in this context.
