From the test case provided, it is clear that the `test_groupby_axis_1` method is attempting to perform a groupby operation using the `group_name` variable as a key. This key, which is passed on to the `groupby()` method on a DataFrame, is expected to provide the resultant groups based on the key along the `axis=1`. The error indicated that there is a `KeyError: 'x'`, which typically means that the specified key 'x' is not present in the object (DataFrame in this case). 

In terms of the function `_get_grouper`, the purpose of this function is to construct and return a BaseGrouper, which is used as an internal mapping for creating grouper indexers. Based on the detailed error message, the function starts by retrieving the `group_axis` from the input object `obj` using the specified `axis`. It then proceeds to validate the `level` as being compatible with the passed axis of the object.

The error message signals the point of failure at the line `raise KeyError(gpr)` within the section that checks whether the grouper is present in the object. The error clearly states that it encountered a KeyError for the specified grouper 'x'. This indicates that the issue is with the existence of the key 'x' within the passed object.

To address the issue, it would be essential to verify that the key 'x' is present in the object (DataFrame) when the `groupby` operations are being performed. Further in-depth analysis is required to determine the specific context and how the key 'x' is being used within the `groupby` operation.

Based on the content confirmation and exploration of the `test_groupby_axis_1` method and `_get_grouper` function, it appears that 'x' is being referenced as the key for the `groupby` operation in the DataFrame and is expected to be present within the DataFrame itself. Hence, the failure occurring at the line `raise KeyError(gpr)` within the `_get_grouper` function suggests that 'x' is missing from the DataFrame, thus leading to a KeyError.

Resolving this issue would require a thorough understanding of the context in which 'x' is expected to be present within the DataFrame, which will allow for debugging and rectifying errors accordingly.

In summary, the provided error message and test function point to the `KeyError: 'x'` issue within the `_get_grouper` function when performing a `groupby` operation within the DataFrame. The resolution would involve validating the presence of the key 'x' in the DataFrame and ensuring its appropriateness for the `groupby` operation.
