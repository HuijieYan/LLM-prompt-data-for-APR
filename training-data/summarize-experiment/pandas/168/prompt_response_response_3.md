Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug is occurring within the `_get_grouper` function when attempting to perform a `groupby` operation using the axis=1 parameter and column names as the grouping key. The error message indicates a KeyError for the specified column name, suggesting that the column could not be found within the DataFrame.

The potential error location within the `_get_grouper` function is likely in the section that checks whether the specified grouper (column name) is present in the object (DataFrame). The KeyError is raised at this point, indicating that the specified column name is not found in the DataFrame.

The bug is likely occurring due to the way the function handles the specified column name when attempting to group by axis=1. It's possible that the function is not correctly identifying the specified column name within the DataFrame, leading to the KeyError.

To address this bug, it's important to review how the function processes the specified column name when performing the groupby operation along axis=1. The function should accurately identify and retrieve the specified column name from the DataFrame for grouping and aggregation.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to ensure that the function accurately retrieves the specified column name from the DataFrame when performing the groupby operation along axis=1. Additionally, proper validation and handling of the specified column name are necessary to avoid the KeyError.

Here is the corrected code for the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing function logic)

    # Identify the group_axis based on the specified axis
    group_axis = obj._get_axis(axis)

    if axis == 1:  # If grouping along axis=1 (columns)
        if key is not None and isinstance(key, str):
            if key in obj.columns:  # Check if the specified key is present in columns
                key = obj[key]  # Retrieve the specified column from the DataFrame

    # ... (remaining function logic without changes)

    return grouper, exclusions, obj
```

In this corrected code, when the function identifies that the grouping is being performed along axis=1, it checks if the specified key is a string (column name) and if it exists in the DataFrame's columns. If the key is found, it retrieves the specified column from the DataFrame for further processing. This adjustment ensures that the function correctly handles grouping by column names when using the groupby() method with axis=1.
