The bug is in the function `_get_grouper` in the pandas library. It seems that the function is not appropriately handling the grouping by columns for the `axis=1` parameter, causing a KeyError to be raised when attempting to group by column names.

Upon analyzing the test case, it is clear that the intention is to group by columns using the 'x' column label. It is expected that the `groupby(by="x", axis=1).sum()` operation should group and sum the columns [10, 20]. However, an unexpected KeyError is raised, indicating an issue with the grouping process when using the `axis=1` parameter.

Based on the error message and the provided test cases, it is likely that the bug is occurring in the logic related to handling the `axis=1` parameter within the `_get_grouper` function.

The bug appears to be primarily related to the processing and handling of the 'key' variable, specifically when attempting to group by columns using the `axis=1` parameter. It seems that the function is not correctly interpreting the key as a column label when grouping by columns.

To address this bug, it is necessary to review the logic within the `_get_grouper` function related to handling the `axis=1` parameter and ensure that the key is appropriately interpreted as a column label for grouping by columns.

After identifying the potential source of the bug and the reasons behind its occurrence, a possible approach for fixing the bug involves revisiting the conditional checks and logic related to determining the axis and handling the key for grouping. It may also require updating the processing related to the 'key' variable specifically for the `axis=1` parameter to ensure proper interpretation of column labels for grouping.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
# Corrected function _get_grouper
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    """
    create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal
    mapping of how to create the grouper indexers.
    This may be composed of multiple Grouping objects, indicating
    multiple groupers

    ... (remaining docstring remains unchanged)

    """
    # Revisit the logic related to determining axis and handling the key for grouping
    if axis == 1:
        if key is None:
            key = obj.columns
        else:
            if isinstance(key, str):
                key = [key]
            # Handle groupby by column labels when axis=1
            if set(key).issubset(obj.columns):
                pass  # No action needed, key is valid column label
            else:
                raise KeyError(f"{key} is not a valid column label")

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

This corrected version of the function includes a specific condition to handle the `axis=1` parameter, ensuring that the key is appropriately interpreted as a column label for grouping by columns. This change aims to address the bug related to the KeyError raised when attempting to group by columns using the `axis=1` parameter.
