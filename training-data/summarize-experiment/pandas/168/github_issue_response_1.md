Summary:
The GitHub issue titled "GroupBy(axis=1) Does Not Offer Implicit Selection By Columns Name(s)" details a bug with the groupby() function in Pandas. The bug occurs when trying to group by columns using the axis=1 parameter and providing column names. Instead of grouping and summing the specified columns, a KeyError is raised, indicating that the columns could not be found. The documentation for groupby() seemingly confirms that grouping by columns using the "by" argument should be possible, which makes the exception unexpected.

The expected output should be a dataframe with the same index but grouped and summed columns based on the specified column names.

This bug affects the functionality of the groupby() method in Pandas and needs to be addressed in order to ensure that users can effectively group and aggregate data based on columns.
