Please correct the malfunctioning function provided below by using the relevant information listed to address this bug. Then, produce a revised version of the function that resolves the issue. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.

## Test Case Summary
Analyzing the portion of the buggy function code that raised the error, the `_get_grouper` function appears to be designed to create and return a `BaseGrouper`, which is an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers. It can be composed of multiple `Grouping` objects, indicating multiple groupers. The function takes in multiple arguments, including the object `obj`, a `key`, an `axis`, a `level`, a `sort` parameter, an `observed` flag, a `mutated` flag, and a `validate` flag. The function contains conditional logic and complex processing to handle different cases and input types.

Based on the error message from the failed test case, it appears that the issue occurs when invoking `df.groupby(group_name, axis=1).sum()` method. The error message indicates that a `KeyError` is raised with the message `"KeyError: 'x'"`.

Reviewing the test function code, it is evident that `group_name` is being set to `['x']` as part of the parameterized test cases. The `df.groupby(group_name, axis=1).sum()` method is then called with `group_name` as an argument, specifying the axis as 1.

Considering the inputs and the error specifically indicating a `KeyError: 'x'`, it is reasonable to focus on the section of the `_get_grouper` function dealing with the `key` parameter and the case that specifically handles the processing when `key` is encountered.

Referring to the `_get_grouper` function, there are several logical branches based on the data types or structure of the provided `key`. The issue could potentially be related to how the function handles a `key` value that is passed as `['x']` and how it fails to process this specific input as expected.

Given the context of the test function invoking `groupby` with a `group_name` argument of `['x']`, the issue may stem from how the `_get_grouper` function processes this input, resulting in a `KeyError` when trying to use `'x'` as a key.

In summary, the critical information extracted from the test function and the error message is related to the specific input value `['x']` passed as `group_name` to the `df.groupby(group_name, axis=1).sum()` method, leading to the `KeyError: 'x'` error during the execution of the `groupby` operation. The cause of the error is linked to the way the `_get_grouper` function handles this input, potentially resulting in a failure to process the input key correctly. Further investigation of the processing logic in the `_get_grouper` function specific to handling the `key` input, especially when it is an array `['x']`, is necessary to pinpoint the root cause of the failure and resolve the bug.



## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

Looking into the buggy function and the variable logs for the multiple test cases, the issues appear to be with the reference to the columns and indices, as well as the logic of identifying whether the input parameters are single or multiple levels. Let's break down the common problems and how they manifest in each buggy case.

1. In Buggy cases 1, 2, 5, and 6, the `level` parameter is getting altered in an unexpected manner. The discrepancies with using single or multiple levels are causing confusions in the function. This is evident in the runtime values for the `keys` and `match_axis_length`.

2. The code logic inside the function related to checking whether a certain parameter or value is within the axis is flawed and can cause unintended behavior. This is represented by the emergence of multiple if-else conditions and the functions `is_in_axis` and `is_in_obj` not functioning as intended.

3. There seems to be inconsistent logic being applied in the function when handling the `'key'` parameter, especially when handling tuples. Specifically, the warning message about interpreting  a tuple `'by'` differently is being issued, suggesting that the logic for handling tuples as keys is flawed.

4. The function is not consistently handling MultiIndex instances, as can be seen from the runtime values of `group_axis` and `level`. The `level` is getting transformed inappropriately, and this lack of consistent treatment indicates problems with MultiIndex operations in the function.

To correct these issues, the code in the function `_get_grouper` should be re-evaluated to ensure consistent handling of single and multiple levels, improve the handling of MultiIndex instances across the function, and sanitize the code to ensure proper checks for parameters and values within the axis.

It's evident that the current function lacks the necessary logic to handle multi-level indices and columns appropriately, and the conditional checks are not consistent across different cases, allowing for unexpected behaviors. Improvements or additional checks in these areas will likely resolve the issues encountered in the test cases.



## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

The function `_get_grouper` is responsible for creating and returning a `BaseGrouper`, an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers. It does this by creating a composition of multiple `Grouping` objects, indicating multiple groupers. The groupers are ultimately index mappings, originating from index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers.

The function starts by retrieving the `group_axis` from the object using the specified `axis`. It then proceeds with validations based on the provided `level` and `key` parameters. It also checks for `observed`, and if `validate` is True, then it validates key/level overlaps.

It uses a series of conditional checks for different types of input parameters. The function logic includes processing different types of input scenarios for the `level` and `key` parameters, handling single and multiple levels, and ensuring that the appropriate input is used for grouping.

It then constructs the `groupings` and `exclusions` based on the input and returns the final `grouper`, along with the `exclusions` and the input `obj`.

The other parts of the function involve checks, like validating if the length of the grouper and axis must be the same, and creating the internal grouper based on the provided groupings.

The expected return value in tests comprises the expected output based on specific test cases or different scenario inputs. The information includes the expected values and types of variables before the function returns. This involves meticulously examining the variable logs and correlating them with the source code to construct a coherent understanding of the function's behavior and logic.



# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
GroupBy(axis=1) Does Not Offer Implicit Selection By Columns Name(s)
```

## The associated detailed issue description
```text
Code Sample, a copy-pastable example if possible
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

df = pd.DataFrame(np.arange(12).reshape(3, 4), index=[0, 1, 0], columns=[10, 20, 10, 20])
df.index.name = "y"
df.columns.name = "x"

print df

print
print "Grouped along index:"
print df.groupby(by="y").sum()

print
print "Grouped along columns:"
# The following raises a KeyError even though  "x" is a column name
# (like "y" above, which is an index name):
df.groupby(by="x", axis=1).sum()
Problem description
The exception at the end is surprising: the intent is clearly to group by columns, on the "x" column label.

Furthermore, the documentation for groupby() seems to confirm this, as it states for the "by" argument that "A str or list of strs may be passed to group by the columns in self".

Expected Output
A dataframe with index [0, 1, 0] but grouped (and summed) columns [10, 20].

I wasn't able to test with the latest Pandas version, sorry!
