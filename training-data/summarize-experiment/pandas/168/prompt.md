Please correct the malfunctioning function provided below by using the relevant information listed to address this bug. Then, produce a revised version of the function that resolves the issue. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.

```

Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:
The key information about the bug in the `_get_grouper` function and the corresponding test case is as follows:

From the test case, the following information is revealed:
- The test function test_groupby_axis_1 is described in the error message.
- It is being tested with input `group_name = ['x']`.
- The main operation being run is `df.groupby(group_name, axis=1).sum()`.

From the error message, the following information can be derived:
- It explains that a KeyError occurred in the `df.groupby(group_name, axis=1).sum()` operation.
- The location where the error occurred is specified as line 615 in the `pandas/core/groupby/grouper.py` file.

In addition, the error message provides a traceback of the function call stack:
```
File "pandas/tests/groupby/test_groupby.py", line 1874, in test_groupby_axis_1
```
This indicates the location in the test file where the error occurred, providing a reference to the specific test function that triggers the error.

Now, to dive deeper into the specifics of the error: 
- The error message indicates that a `KeyError` was raised.
- The key causing the error is identified as 'x'.
- This `KeyError` is raised at line 615 of `pandas/core/groupby/grouper.py`.

The key 'x' causing the `KeyError` suggests that there is an issue with the 'x' key when it is passed to the `groupby` function. The source of the problem is obscure and requires further investigation into the implementation of the `_get_grouper` function and how the 'x' key is being handled by the `groupby` operation, potentially in relation to the axis specified.

To resolve the bug, a detailed analysis of the `_get_grouper` function is needed to understand the handling of the key and its relation to the `groupby` operation with a focus on the axis specified. Additionally, the `groupby` implementation in `pandas/core/groupby/grouper.py` where the `KeyError` occurs in line 615 will need to be examined to determine how the 'x' key is being processed in this context.



## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

After carefully analyzing the function code and the input/output variable values for different cases, it's clear that the primary issue lies in the logic of processing the 'key' and 'level' parameters within the `_get_grouper` function code.

Here are the observations and specific issues identified for each case:

##### Buggy case 1:
- The key variable is initialized with a string value 'x', but it is later transformed into a list containing the same string. This change does not appear to have any specific logic or purpose associated with it.
- The `is_tuple` and `match_axis_length` booleans are both computed as `False`, which may be indicative of an underlying issue in handling tuple-like objects.
- The `any_callable`, `any_groupers`, and `any_arraylike` flags are all evaluated to False, suggesting that the function logic related to these checks might be problematic.

##### Buggy case 2:
- The same redundant conversion of a string key into a list is observed in this case as well.
- Similar issues with the `is_tuple`, `match_axis_length`, and `any_callable`, `any_groupers`, `any_arraylike` flags being set to False are observed.

##### Buggy case 3:
- A recurring pattern of redundant string-to-list conversion for the 'key' variable is seen in this case too.
- The flags `is_tuple`, `match_axis_length`, `any_callable`, `any_groupers`, `any_arraylike` all evaluated as False, pointing towards inconsistent logic.

##### Buggy case 4:
- Once again, the 'key' variable is converted from a string to a list unnecessarily.
- Consistent issues with the `is_tuple`, `match_axis_length`, `any_callable`, `any_groupers`, `any_arraylike` flags being set to False are noticed.

##### Buggy case 5:
- The same redundant string-to-list conversion for the 'key' variable is evident.
- Similar findings in the evaluation of the `is_tuple`, `match_axis_length`, `any_callable`, `any_groupers`, `any_arraylike` flags as False continue.

##### Buggy case 6:
- Repetition of unnecessary string-to-list conversion for the 'key' variable is found.
- Consistent patterns of evaluating the `is_tuple`, `match_axis_length`, `any_callable`, `any_groupers`, `any_arraylike` flags as False are present.

##### Buggy case 7:
- Redundant operations of converting the 'key' variable from a string to a list are recurring.
- Consistent issues related to the flags `is_tuple`, `match_axis_length`, `any_callable`, `any_groupers`, `any_arraylike` being set to False are visible.

##### Buggy case 8:
- Redundant pattern of converting a string key to a list is observed once more.
- Similar issues with the `is_tuple`, `match_axis_length`, `any_callable`, `any_groupers`, `any_arraylike` flags being set to False are noticed.

Based on these observations, the recurring redundancy in operations suggests that the processing of the 'key' variable, specifically the unnecessary conversion from a string to a list, is the main issue affecting all test cases. Additionally, the inconsistent behavior of the flags `is_tuple`, `match_axis_length`, `any_callable`, `any_groupers`, `any_arraylike` suggests flaws in the logic governing their evaluation.

To resolve the issues, it's essential to review and streamline the logic related to the handling and processing of the 'key' variable, and further investigate the logic governing the flags mentioned above. This will likely involve correcting the unnecessary string-to-list conversion within the function and ensuring a consistent evaluation of the flags to reflect the intended behavior. Once these issues are addressed, retesting the function with the sample cases should provide valuable feedback on the effectiveness of the changes.



## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

Based on the source code of the `_get_grouper` function and the detailed information on the expected inputs and outputs for the function, it can be summarized that the core logic of the function involves creating and returning a `BaseGrouper`, which is an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers. This may be composed of multiple `Grouping` objects, indicating multiple groupers.

The function first initializes the `group_axis` variable by calling the `_get_axis` method of the `obj`. It then goes through a series of condition checks and processes to determine which "groupings" should be created. This involves validating the passed single level, managing key and level values, checking for categorical groupers, and handling different types of keys such as Grouper, BaseGrouper, and tuple.

The function loops through the keys and levels, checking if the grouper should be created based on the data axis, the object itself, or the presence of a Grouper object. It also handles cases where groupings are empty or have no group keys passed.

Finally, the function creates the `BaseGrouper` object based on the determined groupings, and returns it along with a list of exclusions and the original object.

The core logic revolves around processing the input parameters to create the appropriate Grouping objects and then using these objects to create a BaseGrouper, which is then returned as the output of the function.



# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
GroupBy(axis=1) Does Not Offer Implicit Selection By Columns Name(s)
```

## The associated detailed issue description
```text
Code Sample, a copy-pastable example if possible
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

df = pd.DataFrame(np.arange(12).reshape(3, 4), index=[0, 1, 0], columns=[10, 20, 10, 20])
df.index.name = "y"
df.columns.name = "x"

print df

print
print "Grouped along index:"
print df.groupby(by="y").sum()

print
print "Grouped along columns:"
# The following raises a KeyError even though  "x" is a column name
# (like "y" above, which is an index name):
df.groupby(by="x", axis=1).sum()
Problem description
The exception at the end is surprising: the intent is clearly to group by columns, on the "x" column label.

Furthermore, the documentation for groupby() seems to confirm this, as it states for the "by" argument that "A str or list of strs may be passed to group by the columns in self".

Expected Output
A dataframe with index [0, 1, 0] but grouped (and summed) columns [10, 20].

I wasn't able to test with the latest Pandas version, sorry!
