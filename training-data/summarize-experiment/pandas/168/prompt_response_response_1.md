Based on the test case and error message provided, it appears that the bug in the `_get_grouper` function is causing a KeyError when attempting to perform a `groupby` operation with the `axis=1` parameter. The error is related to the inability to find the specified columns when grouping by column names.

The potential error location within the `_get_grouper` function is likely in the section where it checks for the presence of the specified key ('x') in the object (DataFrame). This could be in the code segment that handles the determination of whether the grouper is within the object's axis and whether the grouper is the object itself.

The bug occurs because the function encounters a KeyError when attempting to find the specified columns for the groupby operation. This indicates that the specified key 'x' is not present in the object, leading to the failure of the groupby process.

To fix the bug, the `_get_grouper` function should be modified to ensure that the specified key is present in the object (DataFrame) before attempting the groupby operation. This may involve validating the existence of the specified key within the object and handling scenarios where the key is not found.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_grouper` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # Existing code remains unchanged
    # ...

    # Validate that the specified key is present in the object before proceeding
    if key not in obj.columns:
        raise ValueError("Key '{}' not found in the object".format(key))

    # Continue with the rest of the function's logic, ensuring that the specified key exists

    # ... (rest of the function's code)

    # Return the corrected grouper and other relevant values
```

In the corrected code, an additional check is introduced to validate the existence of the specified key within the columns of the object. If the key is not found in the object, a ValueError is raised to indicate that the key is not present.

By incorporating this validation, the bug related to the KeyError when performing a `groupby` operation with the `axis=1` parameter and providing column names should be resolved. This ensures that the specified key is checked for its presence in the object before further processing takes place.
