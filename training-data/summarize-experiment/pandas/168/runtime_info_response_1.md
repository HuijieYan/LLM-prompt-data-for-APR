Looking into the buggy function and the variable logs for the multiple test cases, the issues appear to be with the reference to the columns and indices, as well as the logic of identifying whether the input parameters are single or multiple levels. Let's break down the common problems and how they manifest in each buggy case.

1. In Buggy cases 1, 2, 5, and 6, the `level` parameter is getting altered in an unexpected manner. The discrepancies with using single or multiple levels are causing confusions in the function. This is evident in the runtime values for the `keys` and `match_axis_length`.

2. The code logic inside the function related to checking whether a certain parameter or value is within the axis is flawed and can cause unintended behavior. This is represented by the emergence of multiple if-else conditions and the functions `is_in_axis` and `is_in_obj` not functioning as intended.

3. There seems to be inconsistent logic being applied in the function when handling the `'key'` parameter, especially when handling tuples. Specifically, the warning message about interpreting  a tuple `'by'` differently is being issued, suggesting that the logic for handling tuples as keys is flawed.

4. The function is not consistently handling MultiIndex instances, as can be seen from the runtime values of `group_axis` and `level`. The `level` is getting transformed inappropriately, and this lack of consistent treatment indicates problems with MultiIndex operations in the function.

To correct these issues, the code in the function `_get_grouper` should be re-evaluated to ensure consistent handling of single and multiple levels, improve the handling of MultiIndex instances across the function, and sanitize the code to ensure proper checks for parameters and values within the axis.

It's evident that the current function lacks the necessary logic to handle multi-level indices and columns appropriately, and the conditional checks are not consistent across different cases, allowing for unexpected behaviors. Improvements or additional checks in these areas will likely resolve the issues encountered in the test cases.
