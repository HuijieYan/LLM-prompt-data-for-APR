Based on the given information, the bug seems to be related to the handling of the 'key' parameter and the specified axis in the `_get_grouper` function. The key 'x' is intended to be used for grouping along the columns, but it is resulting in a KeyError instead.

The potential error location within the `_get_grouper` function is likely related to the processing of the 'key' parameter and its interaction with the 'axis' parameter, specifically when the specified axis is 1.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is most likely due to the inconsistency in handling the 'key' parameter for column-wise grouping (axis=1). The function may not be correctly interpreting the 'key' value when used for grouping along the columns.

To fix the bug, the processing of the 'key' parameter for column-wise grouping needs to be reviewed and adjusted to ensure that it correctly identifies and handles the column labels. Additionally, the logic for axis-specific handling of the 'key' parameter should be double-checked for any inconsistencies.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_grouper` function:

```python
# Corrected _get_grouper function
def _get_grouper(
    obj,
    key=None,
    axis=0,
    level=None,
    sort=True,
    observed=False,
    mutated=False,
    validate=True,
):
    # ... (existing function code)

    if axis == 1 and is_list_like(key):
        # Check if the key refers to column names
        if set(key).issubset(obj.columns):
            # Create the BaseGrouper for column-wise grouping
            groupings = [Grouping(obj, obj[key])]
            grouper = BaseGrouper(obj, groupings, sort=sort, mutated=mutated)
            return grouper, [], obj

    # ... (existing function code)
```

The corrected code includes a specific check for column-wise grouping (axis=1) and ensures that the 'key' parameter, when a list, is correctly interpreted as column labels. If the specified 'key' refers to columns, it proceeds to create a BaseGrouper for column-wise grouping.

This fix should address the issue related to the KeyError when using the 'key' parameter for grouping along the columns (axis=1).
