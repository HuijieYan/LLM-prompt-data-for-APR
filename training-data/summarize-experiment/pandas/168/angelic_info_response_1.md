Based on the provided function code and the expected return values and types for different test cases, we can summarize the core logic as follows:

The `_get_grouper` function is designed to create and return a BaseGrouper, which is an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers. The function attempts to figure out different passed-in references and then creates a Grouping for each one, combined into a BaseGrouper.

The function processes multiple input parameters such as `obj`, `key`, `axis`, `level`, `sort`, `observed`, `mutated`, and `validate`. It subsequently performs various operations based on the specific values and types of these input parameters.

The logic of the function involves conditional checks, conversions, and error handling based on the input parameters. It handles scenarios where the `key` can be a single level, a list-like object, or a tuple. The function also deals with cases where `key` is already a Grouper or a BaseGrouper instance.

The function performs checks for compatibility of the passed single level with the object's axis and handles MultiIndex and non-MultiIndex cases differently. It allows for level to be a length-one list-like object and performs validations based on the type and value of `level`.

Further, the function processes different scenarios involving `key` and its type. It processes tuples, arrays, and other non-specific inputs. There are also checks to determine if `key` is hashable and whether it refers to an index replacement.

The core logic also involves operations related to creating the sought-after Grouping, managing exclusions, and handling categorical data types. Additionally, it defines functions to determine whether the grouper is within the object's axis and whether the grouper is the object itself.

Based on the state of input parameters, the function constructs groupings, exclusions, and the internals grouper before returning these values. The function's flow is highly dependent on the types and values of input parameters and dynamically adjusts its internal operations based on these factors.
