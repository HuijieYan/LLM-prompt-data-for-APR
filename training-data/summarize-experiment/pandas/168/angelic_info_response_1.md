The function `_get_grouper` is responsible for creating and returning a `BaseGrouper`, an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers. It does this by creating a composition of multiple `Grouping` objects, indicating multiple groupers. The groupers are ultimately index mappings, originating from index mappings, keys to columns, functions, or Groupers.

The function starts by retrieving the `group_axis` from the object using the specified `axis`. It then proceeds with validations based on the provided `level` and `key` parameters. It also checks for `observed`, and if `validate` is True, then it validates key/level overlaps.

It uses a series of conditional checks for different types of input parameters. The function logic includes processing different types of input scenarios for the `level` and `key` parameters, handling single and multiple levels, and ensuring that the appropriate input is used for grouping.

It then constructs the `groupings` and `exclusions` based on the input and returns the final `grouper`, along with the `exclusions` and the input `obj`.

The other parts of the function involve checks, like validating if the length of the grouper and axis must be the same, and creating the internal grouper based on the provided groupings.

The expected return value in tests comprises the expected output based on specific test cases or different scenario inputs. The information includes the expected values and types of variables before the function returns. This involves meticulously examining the variable logs and correlating them with the source code to construct a coherent understanding of the function's behavior and logic.
