Based on the source code of the `_get_grouper` function and the detailed information on the expected inputs and outputs for the function, it can be summarized that the core logic of the function involves creating and returning a `BaseGrouper`, which is an internal mapping of how to create the grouper indexers. This may be composed of multiple `Grouping` objects, indicating multiple groupers.

The function first initializes the `group_axis` variable by calling the `_get_axis` method of the `obj`. It then goes through a series of condition checks and processes to determine which "groupings" should be created. This involves validating the passed single level, managing key and level values, checking for categorical groupers, and handling different types of keys such as Grouper, BaseGrouper, and tuple.

The function loops through the keys and levels, checking if the grouper should be created based on the data axis, the object itself, or the presence of a Grouper object. It also handles cases where groupings are empty or have no group keys passed.

Finally, the function creates the `BaseGrouper` object based on the determined groupings, and returns it along with a list of exclusions and the original object.

The core logic revolves around processing the input parameters to create the appropriate Grouping objects and then using these objects to create a BaseGrouper, which is then returned as the output of the function.
