Based on the explanations and analysis provided, it seems that the issue with the `_try_convert_to_date` function lies in its handling of boolean values and the conversion to datetime. The function should be updated to handle boolean values gracefully and ensure that they are not mistakenly passed to the `to_datetime` function.

To resolve the bug in the `_try_convert_to_date` function, the following approaches can be taken:
1. Add a type check for boolean values and handle them appropriately before any conversion attempts.
2. Ensure that boolean values are not inadvertently passed to the `to_datetime` function, as they cannot be converted to datetime.

Here's the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function with the bug fixed:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray-like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    if not len(data):  # no conversion on empty
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    elif new_data.dtype == "bool":  # handle boolean values
        new_data = new_data.astype("int64")

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

In this corrected version, the function now handles boolean values by converting them to "int64" before any operation that could involve datetime. This prevents boolean values from being passed to the `to_datetime` function, resolving the issue that caused the TypeError. This corrected version can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy function to ensure that the issue is resolved.
