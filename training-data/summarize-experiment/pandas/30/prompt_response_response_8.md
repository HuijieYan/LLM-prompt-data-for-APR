Based on the given information, the error is occurring when attempting to convert boolean values into datetime objects in the `try_convert_to_date` function. To address this issue, the function needs to be modified to check the type of the input data before attempting to convert it to datetime objects.

Here is a revised version of the function that resolves the issue:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray-like object into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    else:
        return data, False

    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

In this revised version, we added a check for the type of the input data before attempting any conversion. If the data is not of type "object," the function immediately returns the input data and a boolean value of False, indicating that the parsing was not successful.

This modification ensures that the function does not attempt to convert non-object data types into datetime objects, resolving the TypeError issue that was occurring.
