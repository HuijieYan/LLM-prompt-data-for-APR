The error message indicates that the TypeError occurred in the `array_to_datetime_object` method in the `_libs/tslib.pyx` file. Specifically, it states that `<class 'bool'>` is not convertible to datetime, suggesting that there is an issue with the conversion of boolean values to datetime in the `_try_convert_to_date` method of the `_json.py` file.

The failing test function `test_readjson_bool_series` uses the `read_json` method to parse the JSON string `"[true, true, false]"` into a series. The expected result is a Pandas Series containing boolean values `[True, True, False]`.

The error message stemming from the failed test indicates that boolean values are not convertible to datetime, which points to an issue within the `read_json` function's parsing mechanism, especially regarding boolean data types.

The `read_json` method is calling the `_try_convert_to_date` method during its internal operations. This function's purpose is to try to parse a given array-like object into a date column, coercing object types to integer if possible and then checking if the provided data is in an acceptable range. Lastly, it attempts to convert the data to datetime using the `to_datetime` function.

However, the error message indicates that the `to_datetime` method is encountering a boolean (presumably the value "True" or "False") that is not convertible to a datetime. The conversion of boolean values to datetime is incorrect, as pointed out by the error message, and likely results from the initial parsing of the boolean values from the input JSON string.

To fix the bug, the `_try_convert_to_date` method should perform type checks or handle boolean values gracefully before attempting to convert them to datetime. This should prevent the `to_datetime` method from encountering boolean values that it cannot convert to datetime. The `read_json` method also needs to handle boolean values correctly during the parsing of the input. These adjustments will ensure that boolean values are appropriately converted without triggering the TypeError as indicated in the error message.
