The error message originates from the test function `test_readjson_bool_series` located in the `test_pandas.py` file. The error occurs during the execution of the `read_json` function when the input data "[true, true, false]" is being processed. Specifically, the TypeError states that the type `<class 'bool'>` is not convertible to datetime, and originates from the pandas/core/tools/datetimes.py file at line 747. 

The cause of the error message is deeply related to the `_try_convert_to_date` function in the `pandas/io/json/_json.py` file. 

Looking at the `_try_convert_to_date` function, it appears that this function tries to parse an ndarray-like data structure into a date column. However, the first condition checks if the data parameter is empty and simply returns the parameter and False if it's empty.

The subsequent check operates on the `new_data` which appears to be the input parameter. If the datatype of the `new_data` is "object", then it is attempted to be converted to "int64" using the `astype` method. If this operation fails, a catch block is invoked which does nothing, and the `new_data` is essentially left unchanged.

Subsequently, there is a check to ignore numbers that are out of range using the `min_stamp` value which is not provided in the shared portion of code. It tries to convert `new_data` to datetime using units specified from the `self.date_unit` or `_STAMP_UNITS`. If attempting the conversion with the `to_datetime` function yields a ValueError or OverflowError, it continues to the next unit and tries the conversion again, and so on until all units are exhausted.

The error message indicates that the type `bool` is not convertible to datetime, suggesting that boolean values are present within the input data. The actual issue seems to be with the test data. The function `read_json` is called with the input data "[true, true, false]", which includes boolean values, and the typical behavior of the `to_datetime` function is to raise a TypeError when it encounters a data type that cannot be converted to a datetime.

Therefore, the root cause of the error lies in the input data being passed to the `read_json` function in the `test_readjson_bool_series` test function. The issue could be resolved by changing the input data to not include boolean values, as the `to_datetime` function cannot convert boolean values to datetime.
