The specific section of the test function `test_readjson_bool_series` in `pandas/tests/io/json/test_pandas.py` is making use of the `read_json` method to parse a JSON string into a series and check the output against an expected series using `assert_series_equal`.

The error message that corresponds to this test function shows that there is a `TypeError: <class 'bool'> is not convertible to datetime` which occurs during the execution of the `read_json` method at line 1665 of the test file.

Upon analyzing the error and the provided code, it seems that the error is stemming from the attempt to parse a JSON string containing boolean values into a series and coerce these values into datetime objects.

This issue originates from the `try_convert_to_date` function which is called from `read_json` when attempting to convert provided data to datetime objects. Specifically, the error occurs in the following section of `try_convert_to_date`:
```python
for date_unit in date_units:
    try:
        new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
    except (ValueError, OverflowError):
        continue
    return new_data, True
```
It is clear that the function is performing a direct conversion of the incoming values to datetime objects, and it does not account for situations where the input dataset contains boolean values instead of date representations. This leads to the `TypeError` being raised when attempting to convert the boolean values.

In conclusion, the error in the provided code is due to the attempt to coerce boolean values into datetime objects, which is invalid. To fix this, the `try_convert_to_date` function needs to be adjusted to account for non-date values to avoid such conversion attempts. An efficient fix might be to check the type of the data before attempting to convert it to datetime objects, skipping the conversion entirely if the data is not a compatible type.
