Please correct the malfunctioning function provided below by using the relevant information listed to address this bug. Then, produce a revised version of the function that resolves the issue. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
import numpy as np
from pandas._libs.tslibs import iNaT
from pandas import DataFrame, MultiIndex, Series, isna, to_datetime
```

The following is the buggy function that you need to fix:
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False

## Test Functions and Error Messages Summary
The followings are test functions under directory `pandas/tests/io/json/test_pandas.py` in the project.
```python
def test_readjson_bool_series(self):
    # GH31464
    result = read_json("[true, true, false]", typ="series")
    expected = pd.Series([True, True, False])
    tm.assert_series_equal(result, expected)
```

Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:
The error message originates from the test function `test_readjson_bool_series` located in the `test_pandas.py` file. The error occurs during the execution of the `read_json` function when the input data "[true, true, false]" is being processed. Specifically, the TypeError states that the type `<class 'bool'>` is not convertible to datetime, and originates from the pandas/core/tools/datetimes.py file at line 747. 

The cause of the error message is deeply related to the `_try_convert_to_date` function in the `pandas/io/json/_json.py` file. 

Looking at the `_try_convert_to_date` function, it appears that this function tries to parse an ndarray-like data structure into a date column. However, the first condition checks if the data parameter is empty and simply returns the parameter and False if it's empty.

The subsequent check operates on the `new_data` which appears to be the input parameter. If the datatype of the `new_data` is "object", then it is attempted to be converted to "int64" using the `astype` method. If this operation fails, a catch block is invoked which does nothing, and the `new_data` is essentially left unchanged.

Subsequently, there is a check to ignore numbers that are out of range using the `min_stamp` value which is not provided in the shared portion of code. It tries to convert `new_data` to datetime using units specified from the `self.date_unit` or `_STAMP_UNITS`. If attempting the conversion with the `to_datetime` function yields a ValueError or OverflowError, it continues to the next unit and tries the conversion again, and so on until all units are exhausted.

The error message indicates that the type `bool` is not convertible to datetime, suggesting that boolean values are present within the input data. The actual issue seems to be with the test data. The function `read_json` is called with the input data "[true, true, false]", which includes boolean values, and the typical behavior of the `to_datetime` function is to raise a TypeError when it encounters a data type that cannot be converted to a datetime.

Therefore, the root cause of the error lies in the input data being passed to the `read_json` function in the `test_readjson_bool_series` test function. The issue could be resolved by changing the input data to not include boolean values, as the `to_datetime` function cannot convert boolean values to datetime.



## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

Looking at the given code and the variable values at runtime, let's address each buggy case:

## Buggy Case 1:
1. The input parameter `data` is of type `RangeIndex` and is not empty.
2. It is attempted to convert `data` to the int64 dtype using `astype` method. However, the result of the `astype` method is not producing the expected type change.
3. The variable `new_data` remains a `RangeIndex` even after the attempted type conversion.
4. The condition `if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number)` is not satisfied since the dtype of `new_data` is still `int64`. This condition doesn't check if the dtype is already numeric.
5. `in_range` is an array of booleans to denote if each element in `new_data` is within a specific range. In this case, it incorrectly says that all elements are out of range.
6. The returned value from the function should be `new_data` and `True` if the date parsing is successful, but it's not succeeding.

## Buggy Case 2:
1. The input parameter `data` is a Series of boolean values.
2. It is attempted to convert `data` to the bool dtype using `astype` method. However, the result of the `astype` method is not producing the expected type change.
3. The variable `new_data` remains a Series of boolean values even after the attempted type conversion.
4. The for-loop attempts to convert `new_data` to datetime using different units, but it is not successful in any of the attempts.
5. The returned value from the function should be `data` and `False` since the date parsing is not successful, and that's what is observed.

## Common issues in both buggy cases:
1. The attempted type conversion using `astype` is not affecting `new_data`. This is because the `astype` method is not being called properly. It should be `new_data = new_data.astype("int64")` rather than `data.astype("int64")`.
2. The logic to check if the dtype is numeric before performing range checks is incorrect. It should simply check if the dtype is numeric rather than attempting coercion first.
3. The conditions for checking the range and updating the value of `in_range` are not correctly evaluating if the elements are within range. This needs to be reviewed and updated.

In summary, the issues observed in both cases are due to how the `astype` method is being applied and the incorrect range checks that are being performed. These need to be fixed to ensure the expected behavior of the function.



# Expected return value in tests
## Expected case 1
### Input parameter value and type
data, value: `RangeIndex(start=0, stop=3, step=1)`, type: `RangeIndex`

data.astype, value: `<bound method Index.astype of RangeIndex(start=0, stop=3, step=1)>`, type: `method`

self.min_stamp, value: `31536000`, type: `int`

self, value: `<pandas.io.json._json.SeriesParser object at 0x1150d86d0>`, type: `SeriesParser`

self._STAMP_UNITS, value: `('s', 'ms', 'us', 'ns')`, type: `tuple`

### Expected variable value and type before function return
new_data, expected value: `RangeIndex(start=0, stop=3, step=1)`, type: `RangeIndex`

new_data.dtype, expected value: `dtype('int64')`, type: `dtype`

in_range, expected value: `array([False, False, False])`, type: `ndarray`

new_data._values, expected value: `array([0, 1, 2])`, type: `ndarray`



# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
read_json with typ="series" of json list of bools results in timestamps/Exception
```

## The associated detailed issue description
```text
Code Sample, a copy-pastable example if possible
import pandas as pd
pd.read_json('[true, true, false]', typ="series")

results in the following Pandas Series object in older Pandas versions:
0   1970-01-01 00:00:01
1   1970-01-01 00:00:01
2   1970-01-01 00:00:00
dtype: datetime64[ns]

Since 1.0.0 it raises TypeError: <class 'bool'> is not convertible to datetime

Problem description
The expected output would be a Pandas Series of bools. Note that
with typ="frame" it works and the result is a dataframe with one column with bool values
with convert_dates set to False correctly outputs a Series of boolean values

This is a problem because
users would expect a Series of bools (and neither an exception nor a series of timestamps)
it is inconsistent with the "frame" case

Expected Output
Output of pd.show_versions()
[paste the output of pd.show_versions() here below this line]
