Looking at the given code and the variable values at runtime, let's address each buggy case:

## Buggy Case 1:
1. The input parameter `data` is of type `RangeIndex` and is not empty.
2. It is attempted to convert `data` to the int64 dtype using `astype` method. However, the result of the `astype` method is not producing the expected type change.
3. The variable `new_data` remains a `RangeIndex` even after the attempted type conversion.
4. The condition `if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number)` is not satisfied since the dtype of `new_data` is still `int64`. This condition doesn't check if the dtype is already numeric.
5. `in_range` is an array of booleans to denote if each element in `new_data` is within a specific range. In this case, it incorrectly says that all elements are out of range.
6. The returned value from the function should be `new_data` and `True` if the date parsing is successful, but it's not succeeding.

## Buggy Case 2:
1. The input parameter `data` is a Series of boolean values.
2. It is attempted to convert `data` to the bool dtype using `astype` method. However, the result of the `astype` method is not producing the expected type change.
3. The variable `new_data` remains a Series of boolean values even after the attempted type conversion.
4. The for-loop attempts to convert `new_data` to datetime using different units, but it is not successful in any of the attempts.
5. The returned value from the function should be `data` and `False` since the date parsing is not successful, and that's what is observed.

## Common issues in both buggy cases:
1. The attempted type conversion using `astype` is not affecting `new_data`. This is because the `astype` method is not being called properly. It should be `new_data = new_data.astype("int64")` rather than `data.astype("int64")`.
2. The logic to check if the dtype is numeric before performing range checks is incorrect. It should simply check if the dtype is numeric rather than attempting coercion first.
3. The conditions for checking the range and updating the value of `in_range` are not correctly evaluating if the elements are within range. This needs to be reviewed and updated.

In summary, the issues observed in both cases are due to how the `astype` method is being applied and the incorrect range checks that are being performed. These need to be fixed to ensure the expected behavior of the function.
