In the provided buggy function, `_try_convert_to_date`, there are a few areas where issues could arise. Let's analyze the function and the variables to understand why the test cases might be failing.

First, we observe that the function takes in a parameter called `data`. In the first buggy case, the input parameter `data` is a `RangeIndex` type with the value `RangeIndex(start=0, stop=3, step=1)`. We can see that this input is empty, as the length of the `data` is 3. As a result, the condition `if not len(data):` is False, and the function moves on to the `new_data` assignment.

In the first buggy case, `new_data` is assigned the same `RangeIndex` type as the input `data`. Then, we see that the `new_data` is being checked for its dtype, and if it is of type "object", an attempt is made to convert it to "int64". We see that this attempt does not change `new_data` into "int64", as its dtype remains `dtype('int64')`.

Moving on, the function checks if `new_data` contains numbers that are out of range. This check seems to be incorrect, as `new_data` contains `RangeIndex` values (0, 1, 2), and the condition doesn't seem to accurately capture the intent of the comparison.

In the second buggy case, the input parameter `data` is of type `Series` with boolean values. Similar to the first case, the steps to convert `new_data` from "object" to "int64" and then check its range are followed. However, the specific values and types of variables change.

It's worth noting that in the original function, there is a loop that attempts to convert the `new_data` to a date format using different units (`self.date_unit`). If any of the conversions inside the loop are successful, the function will return the converted `new_data` and a boolean value, indicating the success of the conversion.

Upon analyzing the function's code and the variable logs, it's evident that there are several issues. The condition checks for empty data might need to be revisited. Additionally, the comparison related to checking the range of data also seems problematic.

To fix the issues, it would be essential to revisit the logic for converting and checking the range of data in the function. Furthermore, a review of the loop that attempts to convert `new_data` to a date format may be necessary to ensure that it is functioning as intended.

In conclusion, a thorough debugging session is required to address the issues at hand. This would involve closely inspecting the function's logic alongside the specific variable values and types to pinpoint and rectify the discrepancies.
