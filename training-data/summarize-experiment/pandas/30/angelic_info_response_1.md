Based on the provided code and expected return values, here is a summary of the core logic of the function:

The function `_try_convert_to_date` attempts to parse a given `data` ndarray-like input into a date column. The function first checks if the input data is empty and returns it along with a boolean `False` if it is.

If the input `data` is not empty, the function attempts to coerce object types into `int64` using the `astype` method. If successful, the `new_data` variable is updated.

Next, the function checks if the data type of `new_data` is a number type. It then creates a boolean array `in_range` to identify elements that are out of range based on comparison with a minimum stamp value and a special value `iNaT`. If any elements are out of range, the original `data` is returned along with `False`.

If all elements are within range, the function iterates through different date units and attempts to convert `new_data` to datetime objects. If successful, it returns the transformed `new_data` along with `True`. If all attempts fail, it returns the original `data` along with `False`.

In conclusion, the function tries to convert the input `data` into a date column, handling different data types and date units, and returning a boolean indicating whether the parsing was successful.
