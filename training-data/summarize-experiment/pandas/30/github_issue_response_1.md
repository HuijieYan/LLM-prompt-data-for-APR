Summary:
The issue relates to the `read_json` function in Pandas, specifically when using the `typ="series"` parameter with a JSON list of bools. Prior to version 1.0.0, the function would return a Pandas Series object with datetime timestamps instead of boolean values. However, since version 1.0.0, it now raises a TypeError stating that the class `<class 'bool'>` is not convertible to datetime.

This behavior is inconsistent with the `typ="frame"` case, where the result is a dataframe with one column of bool values. Additionally, setting `convert_dates` to False correctly outputs a Series of boolean values, indicating that the issue lies with the behavior of `read_json` when `typ="series"` is specified.

The expected output should be a Pandas Series of bools, and this issue presents a problem for users who would expect a consistent behavior across different `typ` parameters.

To help with the debugging process, the output of `pd.show_versions()` has been provided, indicating that the issue occurs in Pandas version 1.0.0 in a Python 3.8.1 environment.

This comprehensive analysis of the bug provides a clear understanding of the problem, its impact, and the specific conditions under which it occurs, which can aid in the efficient resolution of the issue.
