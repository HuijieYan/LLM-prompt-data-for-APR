Based on the provided information and the analysis of the buggy function, it seems that the issue lies in the attempt to convert boolean values to datetime. This leads to a TypeError being raised when the `to_datetime` function encounters boolean values in the input data.

To resolve this issue, we need to modify the `_try_convert_to_date` function to handle boolean values gracefully, and to properly perform type conversions and range checks.

Here's the corrected version of the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
class Parser():
    # ... (other code) ...

    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
            except AttributeError:
                pass

        if new_data.dtype == "bool":
            new_data = new_data.astype('int64')

        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data._values)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data._values == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```


In the corrected version, we added a specific check for boolean values in the input data. If the dtype of `new_data` is boolean, then it is converted to `int64` using the `astype` method. Additionally, we made changes to the exception handling by adding a `try except` block for the AttributeError, as it might occur when attempting `astype` on boolean values. We also handled the scenario where boolean values are present in the input data by converting them to `int64` before performing the range checks and datetime conversion. This should address the TypeError raised when boolean values are encountered.

By making these changes, the function should now handle boolean values properly and perform the necessary type conversions and range checks before attempting to convert the data to datetime, thereby resolving the issue and allowing the function to work as expected.

The corrected function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
