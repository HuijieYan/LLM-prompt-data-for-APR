Based on the analysis of the test case, the error is occurring when the function attempts to unstack a MultiIndex using a tuple name, such as `("A", "a")`. The error message indicates that the level "A" is not found, leading to a KeyError.

The potential error location within the function is likely related to how the function handles the input tuple names for unstacking the MultiIndex. It seems that the function may not be correctly parsing the tuple names to access the levels and perform the unstacking operation.

The bug occurs because the function does not handle tuple names correctly when unstacking a MultiIndex. The function is unable to extract the individual levels from the tuple names, leading to the KeyError when attempting to access a level that is not found.

To fix the bug, the function `_unstack_multiple` needs to be updated to correctly handle tuple names when unstacking a MultiIndex. This involves parsing the tuple names to extract individual levels, and then performing the unstacking operation based on these levels.

Here's the corrected version of the function `_unstack_multiple`:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    clevels = [index.get_level_values(i) for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.get_level_values(i) for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        unstacked = data.unstack(clevels, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clevels, fill_value=fill_value)
        
    return unstacked
```

In the revised version of the function, the correct levels are extracted from the input tuple names using the `get_level_values` method. The unstacking operation is then performed using these levels, ensuring that the function can handle tuple names and unstack the MultiIndex appropriately.
