The function `_unstack_multiple` has been provided with the expected inputs and outputs for a specific case to aid the analysis. Based on this information, we will break down and summarize the core logic of the function.

1. The function performs various index manipulations, including the extraction of levels and codes from a multi-index structure.
2. It partitions the input data and index based on the specified column levels (`clocs`).
3. The function handles different cases based on the type of the `data` input. If `data` is a `Series`, certain operations are performed, such as creating a dummy index, copying the data, and unstacking based on the dummy index.
4. In the case that `data` is not a `Series`, the function further processes the data to create new levels, names, and codes based on the result of unstacking.
5. At the end, the function sets the index or columns of the unstacked data based on the newly created levels and codes.

The function performs multiple index-related operations, including unstacking and creating new multi-index structures. The conditional logic based on the type of the input data influences the specific operations and transformations performed.

Overall, the function appears to be tailored for operations involving multi-level indexing and reshaping of the input data based on specified column levels.
