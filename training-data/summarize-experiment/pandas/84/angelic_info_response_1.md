The function `_unstack_multiple` is designed to handle unstacking of a DataFrame when the given input parameters meet certain criteria. The core process of the function is to manipulate the input data and utilize its index structure to unstack the DataFrame and create a new, appropriately formatted DataFrame.

The function starts by checking the length of the input `clocs`. If it's found to be zero, the original `data` is returned as is. Otherwise, the function initializes and structures different variables based on the existing index of the `data`.

The `index` is procured from the input `data`, and specific parts of this index are then extracted based on logic related to `clocs`. These parts include `clevels`, `ccodes`, and `cnames`. Similarly, `rlocs`, `rlevels`, `rcodes`, and `rnames` are derived based on the index structure and the extracted `clocs`.

With these preparatory steps in place, the function then processes the `data` based on its type. If it's a Series, it operates on the `dummy` version of the data; otherwise, it directly works with the `data`.

The unstacking process is carried out and new levels, names, and codes are assigned to the unstacked data based on the earlier derived variables. Finally, the index of the unstacked data is updated based on its type, and the function returns the unstacked data.

Overall, the function seems to be built to handle complex, multi-leveled index data and performs a series of operations to appropriately unstack the data, create a new index, and return the result.
