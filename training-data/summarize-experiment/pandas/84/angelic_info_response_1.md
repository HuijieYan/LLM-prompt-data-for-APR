Based on the detailed information provided on various expected input and output values, and with the accompanied source code and expected variable value and type before function return, the following is a summary of the core logic of the function, `_unstack_multiple`:

1. If the length of the `clocs` is 0, return the `data` as is.

2. Get the `index` from `data`.

3. Convert the `clocs` values to their corresponding level numbers in the `index`.

4. Get the `rlocs`, which are the levels that are not present in `clocs`.

5. Create separate lists for `clevels`, `ccodes`, `cnames`, `rlevels`, `rcodes` and `rnames` from the `index` using the level numbers obtained from `clocs` and `rlocs`.

6. Determine the shape from the lengths of the `clevels`.

7. Perform operations to obtain `comp_ids`, `obs_ids`, and `recons_codes` by invoking specific helper functions such as `get_group_index`, `compress_group_index`, and `decons_obs_group_ids` with relevant parameters.

8. Create a `dummy_index` based on conditions and whether the `data` is a Series or DataFrame.

9. Modify and set the index for the `dummy` data based on the `dummy_index`.

10. If the `data` is a Series, perform an unstack operation and set the new levels, names, and codes. Otherwise, if `data` is a DataFrame, a series of operations involving unstacking, obtaining new levels, names, and codes are performed.

11. Finally, create new columns based on the updated level, names, and codes and set the final index or columns of the unstacked data based on whether it is a Series or DataFrame.

This summary intends to provide a detailed analysis of the core logic of the function by examining its source code and correlating specific variable values noted during the function's execution. It also aims to offer a comprehensive and insightful investigation into the function's behavior and logic.
