Based on the test cases and error messages provided, it seems that the issue lies in the function's handling of multi-index data and its unstacking process. There are two error messages that point towards the `_get_level_number` method, indicating that the specified level is not found in the multi-index names. This could be due to incorrect handling of the hierarchical data and the unstacking operations.

The potential error location within the function is when it attempts to extract the level numbers using `index._get_level_number(i)`. This operation is causing KeyError when the specified levels are not found in the multi-index names.

To fix this bug, it's important to ensure that the function correctly handles the multi-level indices and their associated names. Additionally, the unstacking process needs to be reviewed to ensure it accurately unstacks the data without causing KeyErrors.

One approach to fixing the bug would be to validate the level names and their presence in the multi-index before using them in the unstacking process. Additionally, the function should handle hierarchical data more robustly to avoid errors when processing multi-level indices.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=index.levels[rlocs] + [obs_ids],
            codes=index.codes[rlocs] + [comp_ids],
            names=index.names[rlocs] + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```
