Based on the provided information and the error messages, it is clear that the bug occurs when the `_get_level_number()` method is called on the `index` within the `_unstack_multiple` function. The error indicates that the specified level is not found in the names of the MultiIndex. This suggests that the problem lies in how the function handles MultiIndex data and the unstacking process.

The key reason behind the bug is likely an inconsistency in handling the specified level within the MultiIndex structure. The function might not be correctly identifying the specified level within the MultiIndex, leading to a KeyError or ValueError during the unstacking operation.

To fix this bug, it is necessary to ensure that the function correctly handles the hierarchical nature of the MultiIndex and accurately identifies the specified level for unstacking. This may involve updating the logic for extracting index properties and performing the unstacking operation in a way that is consistent with the multi-level structure of the index.

The corrected function that addresses the bug is provided below:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clevel_numbers = [index.names.index(c) if c in index.names else None for c in clocs]

    if None in clevel_numbers:
        raise KeyError("Specified level not found in the MultiIndex names")

    rlevel_numbers = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clevel_numbers]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clevel_numbers]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clevel_numbers]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clevel_numbers]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlevel_numbers]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlevel_numbers]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlevel_numbers]

    # rest of the implementation remains unchanged
    # ... (unstacking process and handling data based on its type)

    return unstacked
```

In the revised function, instead of directly using `_get_level_number()`, we use a list comprehension to obtain the level numbers for the specified levels. We then check for any `None` values in `clevel_numbers` before further processing, and raise a `KeyError` if the specified level is not found in the MultiIndex names.

This revised implementation addresses the bug by ensuring that the function correctly identifies the specified level within the MultiIndex and handles the unstacking process accordingly.
