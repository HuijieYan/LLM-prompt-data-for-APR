From the error message we can observe that the error is thrown from within the `_get_level_number` method when attempting to proceess a level from the `MultiIndex`. Specifically, it tries to retrieve the index of a level from a Tuple, but encounters a `ValueError` because the level name is not found. Below is the code snippet that showcases the error:

```python
def _get_level_number(self, level) -> int:
    count = self.names.count(level)
    if (count > 1) and not is_integer(level):
        raise ValueError(
            f"The name {level} occurs multiple times, use a level number"
        )
    try:
        level = self.names.index(level)
    except ValueError:
        if not is_integer(level):
            raise KeyError(f"Level {level} not found")
```

The `test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex` is one of the test functions that triggers this error. This test case feeds a hierarchical column index (a MultiIndex) into the `.unstack()` function. The index is set using the `from_product` method, but with mistaken use of a Tuple within the `names` parameter which leads to a situation where the method for extracting the level number, `_get_level_number`, is forced to operate on a Tuple rather than a string. As a result, it encounters the `KeyError`.

By sifting through the error message, we can gain a deeper understanding of how exactly the input data led to this error point in the code and ultimately to the raised exception. Understanding and extracting relevant details from the error message helps in diagnosing and resolving the error.
