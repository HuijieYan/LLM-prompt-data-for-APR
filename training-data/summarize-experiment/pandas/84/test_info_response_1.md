After reviewing the function `_unstack_multiple` it seems that the issue arises from the usage of a `MultiIndex`, particularly in the function `level = self.names.index(level)` that leads to the error `ValueError: 'A' is not in list` in the class `MultiIndex` in the file pandas/core/indexes/multi.py. This error is caused by the failure in indexing the upward level `A` within the `names` attribute of the MultiIndex.

Taking a look at the test function `test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex(self)`, where a `MultiIndex` named `idx` is created with the following signature: `pd.MultiIndex.from_product( [["a", "b", "c"], [1, 2, 3]], names=[("A", "a"), ("B", "b")] )`. This test function then tries to unstack the MultiIndex using the first level's MultiIndex name `("A", "a")` as `unstack_idx`, which is a valid input for unstack.

The test code includes the error message:
```
E ValueError: 'A' is not in list
    pyscript/pandas/core/indexes/multi.py:1286
E KeyError: 'Level A not found'
    pyscript/pandas/core/indexes/multi.py:1289
```
These error messages indicate that an incorrect level (`("A", "a")`) is passed into the _get_level_number method within the pandas/core/reshape/reshape.py file. Consequently, the method cannot locate the name 'A' in the `names` attribute of the MultiIndex instance and must raise a ValueError or KeyError exception appropriately.

As a result, the test case `test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex` ends in a failure as it tries to index on a level that is not available in the `names` attribute of the `MultiIndex`. The subsequent test function `test_unstack_mixed_type_name_in_multiindex` also might go wrong, although further analysis is needed to provide more concrete insights.

To solve the issue, the `MultiIndex` class could be modified to handle the situation when the input names are tuples and make certain that the levels are accessed correctly. Additionally, inserting some print statements in the `_unstack_multiple` method could help in understanding the issue further.
