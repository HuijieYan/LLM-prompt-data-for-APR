Upon analyzing the test function `test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex`, it can be broken down as follows:
1. A multi-index structure is created with index labels identifying 'A', 'a' and 'B', 'b'.
2. A dataframe is populated with two columns 'd' and 'e' and is indexed using the multi-index 'idx'.
3. The dataframe is then unstacked, where the level `"A", "a"` is specified and the unstacked dataframe is compared to an expected dataframe

The error messages indicate that there is an error when the `idx._get_level_number()` method is called in the `_unstack_multiple` function, and that the error is raised at `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]`. Specifically, the error states that 'A' is not in the list of names of the multi-index.

Analyzing the `test_unstack_mixed_type_name_in_multiindex` function, it can be broken down as follows:
1. A multi-index structure is created with index labels identifying `("A", "a")`, `"B"`, and `"C"`.
2. A dataframe is populated with two columns 'd' and 'e' and is indexed using the multi-index structure created in the previous step.
3. The dataframe is then unstacked and compared to an expected dataframe for two test cases.

Further analysis shows that the pytest error indicates that the 'Level A not found' is raised. 

From the analysis of the error messages, the problem lies with the unstacking operation and the _get_level_number method. The error occurs because the specified level `'A'` is not found in the names of the multi-index, which is inconsistent with the expected behavior in the unstacking operation. Therefore, it is important for the `idx._get_level_number()` to correctly handle the multi-index in the test functions.
