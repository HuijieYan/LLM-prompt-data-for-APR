In this buggy function, we have the following sequence of operations:

1. After some initial checks, the function extracts the `index` from the `data` variable and retrieves its properties such as `levels`, `codes`, and `names`.

2. It goes on to construct a `dummy_index` and a `dummy` DataFrame based on certain conditions.

3. Then, it unstacks the `dummy` DataFrame to obtain the `unstacked` DataFrame. If needed, it updates the levels, names, and codes.

4. Finally, it assigns the new columns to the `unstacked` DataFrame and returns it.

Upon analyzing the provided buggy cases, it is observed that the function uses hierarchical indices (a MultiIndex) and conditionally manipulates the input `data` variable to obtain the unstacked DataFrame. 

Examining the first buggy case:
- The input variable `clocs` is initially a tuple `('A', 'a')`.
- The `index` has two levels.
- Various operations are performed using the `index` properties and the `data` variable, eventually resulting in the `unstacked` DataFrame. 

On comparing this with the expected output, it seems that the `unstacked` variable doesnâ€™t match the expected output, which could be due to an erroneous operation while handling the `data` variable or in the process of unstacking. Further debugging is required to identify the specific issue in the code's logic or implementation.

For the second and third buggy cases, similar issues in handling MultiIndex data and unstacking techniques might be causing discrepancies between the expected and actual outputs.

To pinpoint the exact problem, a thorough review of the complex hierarchical data handling and the unstacking process within the function is essential. This could involve examining the conditions for constructing the `dummy` DataFrame, ensuring correct handling of indices, and accurate unstacking of the `dummy` DataFrame to obtain the final `unstacked` DataFrame. Additionally, validating the operations based on the input parameters and the hierarchical nature of the MultiIndex data is crucial.
