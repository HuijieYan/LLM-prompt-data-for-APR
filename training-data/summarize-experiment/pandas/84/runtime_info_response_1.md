From the provided details, we can see that the `_unstack_multiple` function is intended to unstack MultiIndex data. However, there are issues causing it to fail. We'll start by analyzing the different bug cases to understand the specific problems in each.

#### Bug Case 1
The input `clocs` seems to be a tuple with the value `('A', 'a')`, indicating that the function is attempting to unstack the level with names 'A' and 'a'. The `data` input is a DataFrame with a MultiIndex having levels 'A' and 'a'. The relevant variables (`index`, `clevels`, `ccodes`, etc.) have been populated accordingly.

Upon closer inspection, we notice that the bug might be related to wrongly constructing the `dummy_index`, variables `new_levels`, `new_names`, and `new_codes`. Specifically, the creation of `new_levels` and `new_codes` seems to reflect incorrect restructuring of the column levels and codes. Further, the construction of `new_columns` and subsequent assignment to `unstacked.index` or `unstacked.columns` may be impacted as well.

#### Bug Case 2
Similar to Bug Case 1, this scenario also shows the usage of a tuple value for `clocs` as `('A', 'a')`. The `data` input is a DataFrame with a MultiIndex having levels 'A', 'a', 'B', and 'C'. The relevant variables are populated to reflect this input appropriately.

Upon inspection, it appears that similar issues arise in the construction of `new_levels`, `new_columns`, and the subsequent assignment to `unstacked.index` or `unstacked.columns`.

#### Bug Case 3
In this situation, the `clocs` input has the value `(('A', 'a'), 'B')`, indicating an attempt to unstack levels 'A', 'a', and 'B'. The `data` input is a DataFrame with a MultiIndex having levels 'A', 'a', 'B', and 'C', and the relevant variables are initialized accordingly.

Upon analyzing the variables, we once again encounter similar issues with the construction of `new_levels`, `new_columns`, and their respective assignments.

In all these bug cases, it seems that the reorganization of column levels, names, and codes may not be happening correctly. Additionally, the assignment of `unstacked.index` or `unstacked.columns` might not be carried out appropriately. These issues contribute to the failure of the function in correctly unstacking the data.

_In the next step of the debugging process, it would be essential to assess the relevant parts of the function's code, specifically the construction of `new_levels`, `new_columns`, and their assignments, to understand the root cause of the issues observed across these bug cases._
