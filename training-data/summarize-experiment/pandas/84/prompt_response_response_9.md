Based on the provided information and the analysis of the bug, it appears that the issue lies in the `_get_level_number` method when attempting to process the level from the MultiIndex. The method is forced to operate on a Tuple rather than a string, leading to a KeyError.

It seems that the algorithm for unstacking the DataFrame with a MultiIndex is not handling the hierarchy of the MultiIndex correctly, leading to unexpected behavior and errors.

To address the bug, the algorithm for unstacking a DataFrame with a MultiIndex should be revised to properly handle the hierarchy of the MultiIndex and avoid errors related to level names not being found.

Additionally, the algorithm should be updated to handle unstacking of both Series and DataFrames with MultiIndex, ensuring the correct creation of new levels, names, and codes for unstacked data.

Here's the revised version of the function `_unstack_multiple` that resolves the issue:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if not rlevels:
        # If all levels are in clocs, create a dummy index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    unstacked = data.copy()
    unstacked.index = dummy_index
    unstacked = unstacked.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)

    # Update the levels and codes to reflect the unstacking
    new_levels = rlevels + clevels
    new_names = rnames + cnames
    new_codes = rcodes + recons_codes

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

The revised function addresses the issues by properly handling the hierarchy of the MultiIndex, performing unstacking operations, and creating new levels, names, and codes for the unstacked data. It also ensures that the unstacking is correctly applied to both Series and DataFrames with MultiIndex.
