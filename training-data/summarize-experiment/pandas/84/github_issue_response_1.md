## Bug Summary
The bug is related to the unstack method of a pandas Series with a MultiIndex. When trying to unstack the Series using the names of the individual levels of the MultiIndex (specified as a tuple), it results in a KeyError. This occurs when attempting to unstack the Series using the levels specified as ("A", "a"), causing the unstacking operation to fail and raise a KeyError due to the level 'A' not being found.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Create a MultiIndex from the product of two lists, with specific names for the levels ('A', 'a') and ('B', 'b').
2. Create a Series with the previously created MultiIndex.
3. Attempt to unstack the Series using the names of the levels as a tuple, such as s.unstack(("A", "a")).

## Expected Behavior
The unstack operation should successfully reorganize the Series into a DataFrame with 'A' as the columns and 'a' as the index, in accordance with the specified level names.

## Observed Behavior
The unstack operation fails and raises a KeyError, specifically indicating that 'Level A not found'.

## Environment
- Python version: Not specified
- pandas version: Not specified

## Additional Comments
The bug has been reported to a couple of individuals for further investigation.
