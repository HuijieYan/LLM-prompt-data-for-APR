Based on the analysis of the provided information, it appears that the issue in the `_unstack_multiple` function arises from incorrect handling of column levels and names, particularly when using tuples as input for unstacking.

The bug originates from the method `_get_level_number` in the pandas MultiIndex class, which fails to locate the specified level based on the input names. This leads to a `ValueError` and a subsequent `KeyError` when attempting to unstack the data.

To resolve this issue, the `_unstack_multiple` function should be modified to correctly handle the tuple names when unstacking MultiIndex data. Additionally, the code should ensure that the levels, names, and codes are reconstructed accurately based on the unstacked data.

Here's the revised version of the function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    dummy = data.copy()
    dummy.index = dummy_index

    unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
    new_levels = clevels
    new_names = cnames
    new_codes = recons_codes

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

This revised function correctly handles the tuple names when unstacking MultiIndex data and ensures that the column levels, names, and codes are reconstructed accurately based on the unstacked data. It should resolve the issues observed in the provided test cases and address the root cause of the bug.
