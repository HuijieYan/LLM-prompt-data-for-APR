Based on the given information and analysis, the bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function seems to be related to the process of unstacking a Series or DataFrame with a MultiIndex. The bug may stem from issues in handling the levels and names of the MultiIndex, resulting in unsuccessful unstacking operations and changes to the original structure of the data.

To address this bug, the following steps can be taken:

1. Review the extraction and handling of level names and numbers from the MultiIndex to ensure that the correct levels are being accessed.

2. Verify the generation of the new levels, names, and codes when unstacking the data to maintain the original structure.

3. Double-check the conditions for creating a new dummy index and handling operations based on whether the input data is a Series or DataFrame.

4. Ensure that the new columns are created and assigned correctly to the unstacked data, taking into consideration the original structure.

5. Verify the use of helper functions and operations to compress, decompress, and reconstruct group indices to guarantee the accurate unstacking of the data.

Here is the corrected and revised version of the `_unstack_multiple` function that addresses the identified issues:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if not isinstance(i, int) else i for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    # group_index, comp_ids, obs_ids, recons_codes
    comp_ids, obs_ids = get_compressed_ids(ccodes, shape, xnull=False)

    if not rlocs:
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the identified issues by ensuring that level numbers, names, and codes are properly handled, and the unstacking process maintains the original structure of the input data. It also includes verification of the conditions for creating a new dummy index and appropriate operations for unstacking Series or DataFrames with a MultiIndex.
