Based on the test cases and error messages, the issue seems to be with the handling of MultiIndex data and unstacking operations within the `_unstack_multiple` function. The error is raised when the `clocs` are used to retrieve the level numbers from the index. This is likely due to the incorrect handling of multi-level indices.

It appears that the code is not appropriately handling hierarchical columns, resulting in errors when unstacking. The code is also not handling the `fill_value` parameter correctly during unstacking, which is indicated in the test cases provided.

To resolve the bug, the function needs to accurately handle the hierarchical columns and properly account for the `fill_value` parameter during unstacking. Additionally, the index level retrieval needs to be based on the level names of the MultiIndex.

Here is the corrected version of the function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Check if data is a Series
    if isinstance(data, Series):
        # Unstack the series
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        # Unstack the DataFrame based on location or names
        unstacked = data.unstack(level=clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

This revised function simplifies the unstacking operation for both Series and DataFrames. It accurately handles the `clocs` parameter and the `fill_value` for unstacking. This should resolve the bug and ensure proper handling of MultiIndex data during unstacking.
