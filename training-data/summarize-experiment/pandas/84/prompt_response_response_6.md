The issue in the function `_unstack_multiple` seems to stem from incorrectly handling multi-level indexing and unstacking operations. The issues arise primarily from the construction of `dummy_index`, `new_levels`, `new_names`, and `new_codes`, as well as the subsequent assignment to `unstacked.index` or `unstacked.columns`. These issues are identified across multiple bug cases and are likely responsible for the failure of the function in correctly unstacking the data.

To address the bug, it is important to revise the logic for constructing `dummy_index`, `new_levels`, `new_names`, and `new_codes` appropriately. Additionally, the way that `unstacked.index` or `unstacked.columns` is assigned should be carefully reviewed to ensure correct reshaping of the data.

Here is the revised code for the `_unstack_multiple` function that resolves the identified issues:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
            unstcols = unstacked.index
        else:
            unstcols = unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [unstcols.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.index.names[0]] + cnames

        new_codes = [unstcols.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(unstcols.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

In this revised version of the function, the construction of `dummy_index`, `new_levels`, `new_names`, and `new_codes` has been updated to ensure correct reshaping of the data. Additionally, the assignments to `unstacked.index` or `unstacked.columns` have been modified to reflect the correct reshaping of the data. This revised function should now address the identified issues and correctly unstack the input data.
