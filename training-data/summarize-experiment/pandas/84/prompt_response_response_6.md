Based on the information provided, it seems that the bug is likely to be in the portion of the function that deals with hierarchical columns and unstacking. The error message indicates that the level name is not found when attempting to retrieve the level number from a Tuple, resulting in a KeyError. This suggests that there may be an issue with how the function is handling the hierarchical columns and their names when performing the unstack operation.

To address the bug, the following approaches can be considered:
1. Ensure that the function correctly handles hierarchical columns and their names when performing unstack operations.
2. Validate the input parameters and their compatibility with the unstack operation to prevent KeyError or other similar exceptions.
3. Refactor the code to improve the handling of MultiIndex and hierarchical columns, taking into account the specific behavior that led to the KeyError.

Here's the revised version of the function that addresses the potential bug by handling hierarchical columns and their names when performing unstack operations:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, (str, int)) else index.names.index(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        output_index = unstacked.index if isinstance(unstacked, Series) else unstacked.columns
        new_levels = [output_index.levels[0]] + clevels
        new_names = [data.columns.name] + cnames

        new_codes = [output_index.codes[0]]
        for rec in recons_codes:
            new_codes.append(rec.take(output_index.codes[-1]))

    new_columns = MultiIndex(
        levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
    )

    if isinstance(unstacked, Series):
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        unstacked.columns = new_columns

    return unstacked
```

In this revised version, the function includes additional checks to ensure that hierarchical columns and their names are handled appropriately when performing unstack operations, aiming to prevent the occurrence of a KeyError. This approach focuses on refining the handling of MultiIndex and hierarchical columns to address the potential bug noted in the original function.
