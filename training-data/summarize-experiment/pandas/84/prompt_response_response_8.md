The bug is likely occurring due to issues in handling the hierarchical columns when unstacking the DataFrame. This seems to cause errors when accessing level numbers and can result in KeyErrors or ValueErrors.

To resolve this bug, the handling of the multi-level index within the `_unstack_multiple` function needs to be revisited. It's important to ensure that proper level numbers are being determined and used for unstacking operations. Additionally, the construction and manipulation of the `dummy` DataFrame, as well as the assignment of new levels, names, and codes need to be carefully handled to align with the expected behavior.

Here is the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Extract the index from the data
    index = data.index
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = index
    else:
        dummy_index = index.reorder_levels(rlocs + clocs)

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.reindex(dummy_index)
        unstacked = dummy.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

In the corrected code, the handling of the multi-level index and unstacking process has been simplified and made more consistent. The `reorder_levels` method is used to appropriately reorder the levels in the index based on the given `clocs`. This allows for a more straightforward approach to unstacking the data.

This revised function should address the bug and provide accurate unstacking results for hierarchical column structures, resolving the issues identified in the provided test cases.
