Based on the test function `test_unstack_tuplename_in_multiindex`, it seems that the error is occurring in the `_get_level_number` method of the index. The error message indicates that 'A' is not in the list of names of the multi-index.

In the function `_unstack_multiple`, the line `clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]` is used to get the level number for each item in `clocs`. This is where the error is occurring, as it fails to find 'A' in the list of names for the multi-index.

The reason for this bug is that the `_get_level_number` method is not handling the multi-index with tuple names properly. It is failing to identify the tuple names like `('A', 'a')` and `('B', 'b')`. This is causing the error when trying to unstack the dataframe based on these tuple names.

To fix this bug, the `_get_level_number` method needs to be updated to correctly handle tuple names in the multi-index. This may involve iterating over the tuple names and retrieving the corresponding level number.

Here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function that addresses this bug:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clevels = []
    ccodes = []
    cnames = []
    rlevels = []
    rcodes = []
    rnames = []

    for loc in clocs:
        if isinstance(loc, tuple):
            # Handle tuple names in MultiIndex
            try:
                clevel = index.names.index(loc)
                clevels.append(index.levels[clevel])
                ccodes.append(index.codes[clevel])
                cnames.append(index.names[clevel])
            except ValueError:
                raise KeyError(f'Level {loc} not found')
        else:
            clevel = index._get_level_number(loc)
            clevels.append(index.levels[clevel])
            ccodes.append(index.codes[clevel])
            cnames.append(index.names[clevel])

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clevels]

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    # ...
```

This corrected version of the function includes a conditional check for handling tuple names in the MultiIndex. If the `loc` in `clocs` is a tuple, it retrieves the level number by checking the index names. If it is a single name, it proceeds with the original approach.

By adding this conditional handling, the function should now be able to correctly identify the level numbers for tuple names in the MultiIndex and address the error observed in the provided test case.
