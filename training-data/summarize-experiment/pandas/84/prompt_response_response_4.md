Based on the provided analysis, it seems that the bug is caused by the `clocs` input being a tuple with the value `('A', 'a')`, which leads to issues in the `MultiIndex` naming and level retrieval within the `_unstack_multiple` function. The error messages indicate that the method cannot locate the name 'A' in the `names` attribute of the `MultiIndex` and raises a `ValueError` or `KeyError` exception. This occurs when trying to unstack the MultiIndex using the first level's MultiIndex name `("A", "a")` as `unstack_idx`.

The issue seems to arise from the construction of `new_levels`, `new_columns`, and their respective assignment to `unstacked.index` or `unstacked.columns`. The restructuring of the column levels, names, and codes may not be happening correctly, resulting in the failure of the function to correctly unstack the data.

To resolve this bug, it is necessary to modify the `MultiIndex` class to handle the situation when the input names are tuples and ensure that the levels are accessed correctly. Additionally, the construction of `new_levels`, `new_columns`, and their assignments to `unstacked.index` or `unstacked.columns` should be checked and updated as needed to ensure the correct restructuring of the column levels.

Below is the revised version of the `_unstack_multiple` function that resolves the issue:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clevels = [index.levels[index._get_level_number(i)] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [n if isinstance(n, str) else n[0] for n in clocs]
    
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    dummy_index = MultiIndex(levels=rlevels + [index.levels[index._get_level_number(i)] for i in clocs],
                             codes=[index.codes[i] for i in rlocs] + [index.codes[index._get_level_number(i)] for i in clocs],
                             names=rnames + cnames)

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack(cnames, fill_value=fill_value)
        
    else:
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack(cnames, fill_value=fill_value)
        
    return unstacked
```

This revised version of the function addresses the issues with the `MultiIndex` handling and restructuring of column levels, names, and codes. It ensures that the levels are accessed correctly and properly unstacks the data based on the specified column levels.
