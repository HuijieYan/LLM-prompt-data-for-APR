## Bug Summary
The issue relates to the failure of the `groupby` function in Python's pandas library when dealing with daily frequency on a clock change day in Cuba. More specifically, the bug causes an `AmbiguousTimeError` to be raised when using `pd.Grouper` on a long clock-change day, such as November 4, 2018.

## Code Sample
The provided code sample demonstrates the use of the pandas library to create a time series DataFrame and then apply the `groupby` function with a frequency of one day (`1D`). The issue arises when the code encounters an ambiguous timestamp, particularly at midnight local time on clock change days.

## Problem Description
The main problem occurs when the code attempts to group the data by day. On clock change days in Cuba, the timestamp for midnight becomes ambiguous due to the change in time. This ambiguity is not handled correctly by the `pd.Grouper`, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

## Expected Output
The expected output is a successful grouping of the data, resulting in three distinct groups for each day (November 3rd, 4th, and 5th, 2018). The group for November 4th should be labeled as '2018-11-04 00:00:00-04:00' and should contain the 25 hourly data points for that day before the clock change.

## Software Environment
The issue is reported on a system with the following software versions:
- Python: 3.6.8.final.0
- pandas: 0.24.2
- numpy: 1.15.4
- pytz: 2016.6.1

## Additional Notes
The issue has been mentioned to be similar in nature to another reported bug (#23742), which was apparently fixed in version 0.24 of the pandas library. However, the current bug persists even with the reported version.

This thorough bug summary aims to provide insights and context to aid in the debugging process of the reported issue.
