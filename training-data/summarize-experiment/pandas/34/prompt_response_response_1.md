Based on the given information and analysis, it appears that the bug is related to the handling of ambiguous times during the resampling process, specifically on clock change days in Cuba. The problematic function `_get_time_bins` is not directly causing the issue, but it may be contributing to the error by not handling ambiguous times appropriately during time binning and labeling.

To address the bug, the resampling process needs to be adjusted to handle ambiguous times caused by daylight saving time changes explicitly. This can be achieved by modifying the frequency or by implementing a mechanism to handle ambiguous times during the resampling process, thereby avoiding the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

Additionally, the use of `pd.Grouper` with a frequency of one day (`1D`) should be reviewed to ensure that the ambiguous timestamp for midnight on clock change days is handled correctly.

Below is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function that addresses the bug and handles ambiguous times during the resampling process:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Adjust for ambiguous times on clock change days
    ambiguous = "infer"  # or based on specific handling of ambiguous times
    if self.freq == '1D':
        ambiguous = "NaT"  # Handle ambiguous times explicitly

    # Generate binner and labels with handling of ambiguous times
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous=ambiguous,
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Remaining code remains unchanged

    # ...

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the revised function, additional handling for ambiguous times has been incorporated into the `date_range` generation of `binner` and `labels` by setting the `ambiguous` parameter appropriately. This modification aims to handle the ambiguous times explicitly during the resampling process, thereby resolving the `AmbiguousTimeError` related to the bug.

When applied as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version, the corrected function should address the bug by appropriately handling ambiguous times during the resampling process.
