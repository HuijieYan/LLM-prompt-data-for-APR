Given the test function and the error message, it appears that the issue lies with handling the DST transition during resampling for down-sampling at midnight. The specific datetime `2018-11-04 00:00:00` is causing the DST ambiguity error due to incorrect handling of the repeated times during the DST transition.

Upon inspection of the `_get_time_bins` function, it seems that the issue may be related to the `insert` operation on the `binner` and `labels` variables. The `insert` method is being used to add `NaT` at the beginning of both `binner` and `labels` if `ax.hasnans` is `True`. However, the `insert` method on a DatetimeIndex returns a new DatetimeIndex, rather than modifying the existing one in place. This means that the `insert` method is creating new DatetimeIndex objects, but the updated values are not being stored in the variables `binner` and `labels`.

To resolve this issue, the `binner` and `labels` variables need to be updated with the new DatetimeIndex objects returned by the `insert` method. This can be done by assigning the returned values of the `insert` method back to the `binner` and `labels` variables.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

        # Update binner and labels with the new DatetimeIndex objects
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By making this change, the `binner` and `labels` variables will now contain the updated values with `NaT` inserted at the beginning. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the returned `binner` and `labels` variables have the correct values.

After applying these changes, the revised function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
