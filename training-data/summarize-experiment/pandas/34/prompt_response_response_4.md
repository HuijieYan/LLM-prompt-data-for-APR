There is an issue occurring in the `_get_time_bins` function that is related to the handling of ambiguous times during the DST transition. The function is involved in generating time bins, labels, and bin edges based on the frequency provided.

The specific datetime `2018-11-04 00:00:00` is causing an ambiguity error due to mishandling of repeated times during the DST transition. This issue is evident from the `AmbiguousTimeError` message in the test function. The error indicates a problem with handling ambiguous times during the DST transition, which is likely to be a result of incorrect adjustment of time bins and labels in the `_get_time_bins` function.

To address this issue, the `binner` and `labels` variables need to be adjusted correctly. The current code uses the `insert` method to add `NaT` at the beginning of `binner` and `labels` when `ax.hasnans` is `True`. However, the issue is that the `insert` method returns a new DatetimeIndex object without modifying the existing one in place.

To fix this bug, we need to update the `binner` and `labels` variables with the new DatetimeIndex objects returned by the `insert` method. This can be done by assigning the returned values of the `insert` method back to the `binner` and `labels` variables to ensure that the modified values are stored.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function, incorporating the necessary adjustment:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # General version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        # Update binner and labels with the new DatetimeIndex objects
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # If we end up with more labels than bins, adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected code, after adding `NaT` at the beginning of `binner` and `labels`, the `insert` method is used to store the returned values back to the respective variables, ensuring that the modification takes effect. This should resolve the issue of incorrect handling of DST transitions and ambiguity in time during the resampling process.
