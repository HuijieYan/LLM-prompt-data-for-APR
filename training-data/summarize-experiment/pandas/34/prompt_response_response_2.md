Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug is related to the failure of the `groupby` function in the pandas library when dealing with a daily frequency on a clock change day in Cuba. The bug causes an `AmbiguousTimeError` to be raised when using `pd.Grouper` on a long clock-change day, such as November 4, 2018.

Given the buggy function `_get_time_bins`, the potential error location might be in the resampling process where the function handles the creation of `binner`, `bins`, and `labels`. It is likely that the resampling process does not handle ambiguous times caused by daylight saving time changes, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError` during the groupby and mean calculation of the resampled data.

To resolve the bug, the resampling process needs to be modified to account for ambiguous times caused by daylight saving time changes. This could involve adjusting the frequency being used for resampling or explicitly handling ambiguous times during resampling to avoid the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function that addresses the bug:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans, ambiguous="infer"  # Handle ambiguous times explicitly
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
In the corrected `_get_time_bins` function, the bug is resolved by explicitly handling ambiguous times during the resampling process. The `lib.generate_bins_dt64` call now includes `ambiguous="infer"` to handle ambiguous times explicitly and prevent the `AmbiguousTimeError` from occurring. This modification should address the bug related to handling ambiguous times during the resampling process.
