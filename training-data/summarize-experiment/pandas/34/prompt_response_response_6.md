Based on the analysis of the given information, it is evident that the issue is related to the handling of ambiguous times during the resampling process. The error message suggests that the ambiguous times are not being resolved correctly during the grouping and mean calculation of the resampled data.

To address this bug, it is essential to ensure that the resampling process accounts for ambiguous times caused by the daylight saving time changes. This could involve adjusting the frequency used for resampling or explicitly handling the ambiguous times during the resampling process to avoid the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

Given the nature of the bug and the requirements for fixing it, the `_get_time_bins` function likely needs to be modified to incorporate handling of ambiguous times during the resampling process.

Here's the revised and corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function that takes into account the handling of ambiguous times:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this revised version, the resampling process explicitly handles ambiguous times by setting `ambiguous="infer"` in the `date_range` function call. This allows the resampling to infer the presence of ambiguous times and handle them accordingly.

By incorporating the handling of ambiguous times in the resampling process, this revised function aims to resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError` that occurs during the grouping and mean calculation of the resampled data.

This corrected code can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function to address the reported issue.
