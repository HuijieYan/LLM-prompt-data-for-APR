Please correct the malfunctioning function provided below by using the relevant information listed to address this bug. Then, produce a revised version of the function that resolves the issue. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
from pandas._libs import lib
from pandas._libs.tslibs import NaT, Period, Timestamp
from pandas.core.indexes.datetimes import DatetimeIndex, date_range
```

The following is the buggy function that you need to fix:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

## Test Functions and Error Messages Summary
The followings are test functions under directory `pandas/tests/resample/test_datetime_index.py` in the project.
```python
def test_downsample_dst_at_midnight():
    # GH 25758
    start = datetime(2018, 11, 3, 12)
    end = datetime(2018, 11, 5, 12)
    index = pd.date_range(start, end, freq="1H")
    index = index.tz_localize("UTC").tz_convert("America/Havana")
    data = list(range(len(index)))
    dataframe = pd.DataFrame(data, index=index)
    result = dataframe.groupby(pd.Grouper(freq="1D")).mean()
    expected = DataFrame(
        [7.5, 28.0, 44.5],
        index=date_range("2018-11-03", periods=3).tz_localize(
            "America/Havana", ambiguous=True
        ),
    )
    tm.assert_frame_equal(result, expected)
```

Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:
Based on the test function `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` and the error message associated with it, it seems that it is related to resampling a datetime index with ambiguous times with daylight saving time changes. The error occurs during the groupby and mean calculation of the resampled data.

In the test function, a datetime index is created and then resampled with a frequency of "1D" using the `pd.Grouper(freq="1D")`. The timezone is changed from "UTC" to "America/Havana" resulting in an ambiguous time error because of daylight savings time changes.

In the error message, the critical point is:
```
E   pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: Cannot infer dst time from 2018-11-04 00:00:00 as there are no repeated times
```

This error message points to the fact that during the resampling process, there are ambiguous times that cannot be resolved because there are no repeated times.

To resolve this error, the resampling process needs to account for ambiguous times caused by daylight saving time changes. This could potentially be achieved by adjusting the frequency or handling the ambiguous times explicitly.

Looking at the given source code for the `_get_time_bins` function, it seems that the problem arises from the time resampling process, likely due to the presence of ambiguous times in the datetime index causing the subsequent issues with resampling and grouping when the mean is calculated. An alteration is required in the resampling process to handle the ambiguous times, to bypass the error involving ambiguous times during the resampling process. This might entail adjustments in the frequency being used for resampling or modifying the way ambiguous times are handled during resampling to avoid the `AmbiguousTimeError`.



## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The function `_get_time_bins` is intended to return the three variables `binner`, `bins`, and `labels`. Let's analyze the provided input parameters and the variables at runtime to understand what went wrong.

First, the function checks if the `ax` parameter is an instance of `DatetimeIndex`. This validation passes as the input `ax` is of type `DatetimeIndex`.

The code then checks the length of `ax` and returns three variables if `len(ax)` is 0. In the provided test case, `len(ax)` is not 0, so this part of the code is not executed.

Next, the function calculates `first` and `last` by calling `_get_timestamp_range_edges` with `ax.min()` and `ax.max()` as input. The values of `first` and `last` seem to be correctly computed and are as expected.

Then, the `binner` and `labels` are generated using `date_range` with the calculated `first` and `last` values along with other parameters such as `freq`, `tz`, `name`, `ambiguous`, and `nonexistent`. The values of `binner` and `labels` seem to be computed correctly and match the expected values.

Following that, `ax_values` are generated by accessing the `asi8` property of `ax`. After that, `binner` and `bin_edges` are adjusted using the `_adjust_bin_edges` method. The values of `binner` and `bin_edges` match the expected values based on the input and the operation performed.

Subsequently, the function uses the `lib.generate_bins_dt64` method to calculate `bins` based on `ax_values`, `bin_edges`, `self.closed`, and `ax.hasnans`. The calculated `bins` seem to match the expected output based on the test case.

The code then contains conditional checks to modify `labels` based on the values of `self.closed` and `self.label` and to insert `NaT` if `ax` has nans. These conditional checks seem to work correctly based on the provided input and the values of the variables.

Finally, the function checks if the length of `bins` is less than the length of `labels`, and if so, adjusts `labels` accordingly. This seems to work as expected based on the values observed.

Given the provided inputs and the observed variable values, there are no apparent issues with the function's code. All the variable values and their generation seem to align with the expected behavior of the function. Therefore, it's likely that the problem lies elsewhere, such as how this function is being called, the data being passed to it, or any subsequent processing of its output.



## Summary of the GitHub Issue Related to the Bug

## Bug Summary
The issue relates to the failure of the `groupby` function in Python's pandas library when dealing with daily frequency on a clock change day in Cuba. More specifically, the bug causes an `AmbiguousTimeError` to be raised when using `pd.Grouper` on a long clock-change day, such as November 4, 2018.

## Code Sample
The provided code sample demonstrates the use of the pandas library to create a time series DataFrame and then apply the `groupby` function with a frequency of one day (`1D`). The issue arises when the code encounters an ambiguous timestamp, particularly at midnight local time on clock change days.

## Problem Description
The main problem occurs when the code attempts to group the data by day. On clock change days in Cuba, the timestamp for midnight becomes ambiguous due to the change in time. This ambiguity is not handled correctly by the `pd.Grouper`, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

## Expected Output
The expected output is a successful grouping of the data, resulting in three distinct groups for each day (November 3rd, 4th, and 5th, 2018). The group for November 4th should be labeled as '2018-11-04 00:00:00-04:00' and should contain the 25 hourly data points for that day before the clock change.

## Software Environment
The issue is reported on a system with the following software versions:
- Python: 3.6.8.final.0
- pandas: 0.24.2
- numpy: 1.15.4
- pytz: 2016.6.1

## Additional Notes
The issue has been mentioned to be similar in nature to another reported bug (#23742), which was apparently fixed in version 0.24 of the pandas library. However, the current bug persists even with the reported version.

This thorough bug summary aims to provide insights and context to aid in the debugging process of the reported issue.
