Please correct the malfunctioning function provided below by using the relevant information listed to address this bug. Then, produce a revised version of the function that resolves the issue. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
from pandas._libs import lib
from pandas._libs.tslibs import NaT, Period, Timestamp
from pandas.core.indexes.datetimes import DatetimeIndex, date_range
```

The following is the buggy function that you need to fix:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,

        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":

    if ax.hasnans:

## Test Functions and Error Messages Summary
The followings are test functions under directory `pandas/tests/resample/test_datetime_index.py` in the project.
```python
def test_downsample_dst_at_midnight():
    # GH 25758
    start = datetime(2018, 11, 3, 12)
    end = datetime(2018, 11, 5, 12)
    index = pd.date_range(start, end, freq="1H")
    index = index.tz_localize("UTC").tz_convert("America/Havana")
    data = list(range(len(index)))
    dataframe = pd.DataFrame(data, index=index)
    result = dataframe.groupby(pd.Grouper(freq="1D")).mean()
    expected = DataFrame(
        [7.5, 28.0, 44.5],
        index=date_range("2018-11-03", periods=3).tz_localize(
            "America/Havana", ambiguous=True
        ),
    )
    tm.assert_frame_equal(result, expected)
```

Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:
From the given error message, it is evident that the test function is attempting to downsample a time series using the `pd.Grouper` class with the frequency of 1 day. The exact line that is causing the error is `result = dataframe.groupby(pd.Grouper(freq="1D")).mean()`. Upon encountering this line, the error is being raised due to an `AmbiguousTimeError` which states "Cannot infer dst time from 2018-11-04 00:00:00 as there are no repeated times".

The code inside the `_get_time_bins` function and related functionalities is likely where the issue lies, as it deals with time binning, generation of time labels, and binner creation based on the frequency provided. There could be some edge cases or errors handling DST (Daylight Saving Time) that are not being adequately handled in this code.

The test function is creating a `DataFrame` with a date range from `2018-11-03` to `2018-11-05`, with an hourly frequency. This range is then localized to "UTC" and then converted to the timezone "America/Havana". The mean is calculated by grouping the data based on a frequency of 1 day. This is a typical time series resampling operation where data from a higher frequency (hourly) is being downsampled to a lower frequency (daily mean).

The error Stemming from the `pandas/_libs/tslibs/tzconversion.pyx:177` file shows the exact issue with ambiguity in time during the DST transition. This means that during the DST transition, there are times that occur twice due to the time shift, and the resampling logic is failing to handle such ambiguous times leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

Based on the error message and the test function, the issue seems to be with handling the DST transition during resampling for down-sampling at midnight. The specific datetime `2018-11-04 00:00:00` is causing the DST ambiguity error due to an incorrect handling of the repeated times during the DST transition, as mentioned in the `AmbiguousTimeError` message.

The error should be inspected within the `_get_time_bins` function or the related functionalities that handle date range generation and time binning based on the frequency provided. It's likely that the DST transition isn't being handled properly, leading to the ambiguity in time. The handling of DST transitions during the resampling process needs to be reviewed and fixed.

In summary, the error seems to be occurring due to the mishandling of DST transitions during the resampling process. The `_get_time_bins` function and its associated logic need to be reviewed and updated to properly handle the ambiguity in time during DST transitions and avoid the `AmbiguousTimeError`.



## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

Looking at the input and output variable values, it seems like the `binner` and `labels` are not being adjusted correctly. The `binner` and `labels` are initialized using the `date_range` function with the `start` and `end` arguments set as `first` and `last` respectively. Additionally, `binner` is being adjusted using the `_adjust_bin_edges` method with the `ax_values`. It looks like the values of `binner` and `labels` are calculated correctly based on the timestamps, frequency, and time zone information provided.

However, the issue seems to be with the `insert` operation on the `binner` and `labels`. The `insert` method is being used to add `NaT` at the beginning of both `binner` and `labels` if `ax.hasnans` is `True`. This operation doesn't seem to be working as expected.

One thing to note is that the `insert` method on a DatetimeIndex returns a new DatetimeIndex, rather than modifying the existing one in place. This means that the `insert` method is creating new DatetimeIndex objects, but the updated values are not being stored in the variables `binner` and `labels`.

To fix this issue, we need to update the `binner` and `labels` variables with the new DatetimeIndex objects returned by the `insert` method. This can be done by assigning the returned values of the `insert` method back to the `binner` and `labels` variables.

Here's the updated code to fix the issue:

```python
if ax.hasnans:
    binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
    labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Update binner and labels with the new DatetimeIndex objects
    binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
    labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
```

By making this change, the `binner` and `labels` variables should now contain the updated values with `NaT` inserted at the beginning. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the returned `binner` and `labels` variables have the correct values.



# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
groupby with daily frequency fails with AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba
```

## The associated detailed issue description
```text
Code Sample
import pandas as pd
from datetime import datetime
start = datetime(2018, 11, 3, 12)
end = datetime(2018, 11, 5, 12)
index = pd.date_range(start, end, freq="1H")
index = index.tz_localize('UTC').tz_convert('America/Havana')
data = list(range(len(index)))
dataframe = pd.DataFrame(data, index=index)
groups = dataframe.groupby(pd.Grouper(freq='1D'))

Problem description
On a long clock-change day in Cuba, e.g 2018-11-04, midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp. pd.Grouper does not handle this as I expect. More precisely the call to groupby in the code above raises an AmbiguousTimeError.

This issue is of a similar nature to #23742 but it seems #23742 was fixed in 0.24 whereas this was not.

Expected Output
The call to groupby should return three groups (one for each day, 3rd, 4th, and 5th of november). The group for the 4th of november should be labelled as '2018-11-04 00:00:00-04:00' (that is the first midnight, before the clock change) and it should contain the 25 hourly data points for this day.
