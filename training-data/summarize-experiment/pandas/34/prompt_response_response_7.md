Based on the analysis of the given information, it seems that the bug is related to the handling of ambiguous times during the resampling process, specifically on clock change days in Cuba. The error occurs due to the inability of the `pd.Grouper` to handle ambiguous timestamps, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

To fix this bug, the resampling process needs to be adjusted to handle ambiguous times caused by daylight saving time changes. This could involve explicitly handling ambiguous times or adjusting the frequency used for resampling.

With this in mind, the following revised version of the `_get_time_bins` function addresses the bug by explicitly handling ambiguous times during the resampling process:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    # Explicitly handle ambiguous times during resampling
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this revised version, the resampling process explicitly handles ambiguous times by setting the `ambiguous` parameter of `date_range` to "infer". This allows the resampling process to infer the presence of ambiguous times and handle them accordingly.

By incorporating this explicit handling of ambiguous times, the bug related to the `AmbiguousTimeError` during the resampling process is effectively addressed.

The corrected function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version to resolve the issue.
