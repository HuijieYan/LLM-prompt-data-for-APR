Taking into account the given information, it appears that the issue with the function `_get_time_bins` arises from the incorrect assignment of the 'labels' variable to 'binner' early on in the function. This could result in unexpected behavior and potentially lead to the AmbiguousTimeError.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that 'binner' and 'labels' are distinct and correctly calculated based on the input DatetimeIndex. Additionally, we should address any manipulation of the lengths of 'binner', 'bins', and 'labels' to ensure consistency and correctness.

Here is the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin may be slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )
    labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels_right = labels[1:]
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels_right
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, the 'labels' variable is generated separately from 'binner' based on the same parameters. Additionally, the manipulation of 'labels' based on the 'self.closed' and 'self.label' conditions has been made more explicit and clear. The use of separate variables to handle the manipulation based on different conditions can help in avoiding unexpected behavior.

This corrected version should address the issue and prevent the AmbiguousTimeError from occurring.
