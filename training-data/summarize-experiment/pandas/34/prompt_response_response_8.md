Based on the provided information and the analysis of the bug, the issue seems to be related to the incorrect assignment of the 'labels' variable to 'binner'. 

Upon careful examination of the code and variable logs, it is evident that 'binner' and 'labels' should not be assigned to each other directly after both have been initialized with the same DatetimeIndex. This logical error causes ambiguity in the subsequent operations.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the variables 'binner' and 'labels' are correctly handled and not erroneously assigned to each other.

Here's the revised version of the function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    labels = binner.copy()  # corrected assignment of labels as a copy of binner

    if self.closed == "right":
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, the 'labels' variable is now assigned as a copy of 'binner' to ensure that the two variables are not directly linked. This should resolve the logical error and prevent ambiguity in subsequent operations.
