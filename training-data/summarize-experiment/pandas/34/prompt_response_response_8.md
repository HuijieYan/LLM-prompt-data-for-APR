Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug is related to the handling of ambiguous times during the resampling process, specifically on clock change days in Cuba. The error message points to an `AmbiguousTimeError` being raised due to the presence of ambiguous timestamps when using `pd.Grouper` with a daily frequency on a clock change day. This issue arises from the inability of the resampling process to handle the ambiguous times caused by the time change.

To address this bug, potential approaches for fixing the issue could include:
1. Explicitly handling ambiguous times during the resampling process, possibly by adjusting the frequency or incorporating logic to handle ambiguous times on clock change days.
2. Ensuring that the resampling process correctly identifies and accounts for ambiguous timestamps, preventing the `AmbiguousTimeError` from being raised.

Given the insight into the bug and the potential approaches for fixing it, here is the corrected code for the problematic function `_get_time_bins`:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
        normalize=True  # Explicitly normalize the generated date range
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the revised version of the function, a potential fix for the bug is to explicitly normalize the generated date range by adding the `normalize=True` parameter when calling `date_range`. This helps in handling ambiguous times and avoiding the `AmbiguousTimeError` caused by ambiguous timestamps during the resampling process.

By incorporating this fix, the revised function should address the bug by explicitly handling ambiguous times and ensuring that the resampling process correctly accounts for ambiguous timestamps, preventing the `AmbiguousTimeError` from being raised. This revised function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version, resolving the identified issue.
