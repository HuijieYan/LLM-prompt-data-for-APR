Based on the error messages and test function provided, it is evident that the issue is related to the `AmbiguousTimeError`. The error occurs during a down-sampling operation at midnight due to the presence of ambiguous timestamps on a day with a clock change (DST transition) in Cuba. 

The bug is likely located within the `_get_time_bins` function and its associated logic. There seem to be problems in handling DST transitions during the resampling process, specifically with the insertion of `NaT` at the beginning of the `binner` and `labels` variables when `ax.hasnans` is `True`. The `insert` method on the `DatetimeIndex` objects is not being utilized correctly, and this is resulting in the ambiguous time error.

To fix this bug, the handling of DST transitions during the resampling process needs to be reviewed and updated. Specifically, the `insert` method on the `binner` and `labels` variables needs to be used correctly to ensure that `NaT` is inserted at the beginning if `ax.hasnans` is `True`.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        # Insert NaT at the beginning of binner and labels
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In this corrected code, the `binner` and `labels` variables are updated correctly by assigning the returned values of the `insert` method back to them when `ax.hasnans` is `True`. This ensures that `NaT` is properly inserted at the beginning of both `binner` and `labels` when necessary.

This revised version of the function should resolve the bug by handling the DST transitions and insertion of `NaT` correctly, thus avoiding the `AmbiguousTimeError`.
