Based on the test function `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` and the error message associated with it, it seems that it is related to resampling a datetime index with ambiguous times with daylight saving time changes. The error occurs during the groupby and mean calculation of the resampled data.

In the test function, a datetime index is created and then resampled with a frequency of "1D" using the `pd.Grouper(freq="1D")`. The timezone is changed from "UTC" to "America/Havana" resulting in an ambiguous time error because of daylight savings time changes.

In the error message, the critical point is:
```
E   pytz.exceptions.AmbiguousTimeError: Cannot infer dst time from 2018-11-04 00:00:00 as there are no repeated times
```

This error message points to the fact that during the resampling process, there are ambiguous times that cannot be resolved because there are no repeated times.

To resolve this error, the resampling process needs to account for ambiguous times caused by daylight saving time changes. This could potentially be achieved by adjusting the frequency or handling the ambiguous times explicitly.

Looking at the given source code for the `_get_time_bins` function, it seems that the problem arises from the time resampling process, likely due to the presence of ambiguous times in the datetime index causing the subsequent issues with resampling and grouping when the mean is calculated. An alteration is required in the resampling process to handle the ambiguous times, to bypass the error involving ambiguous times during the resampling process. This might entail adjustments in the frequency being used for resampling or modifying the way ambiguous times are handled during resampling to avoid the `AmbiguousTimeError`.
