The function `_get_time_bins` is intended to return the three variables `binner`, `bins`, and `labels`. Let's analyze the provided input parameters and the variables at runtime to understand what went wrong.

First, the function checks if the `ax` parameter is an instance of `DatetimeIndex`. This validation passes as the input `ax` is of type `DatetimeIndex`.

The code then checks the length of `ax` and returns three variables if `len(ax)` is 0. In the provided test case, `len(ax)` is not 0, so this part of the code is not executed.

Next, the function calculates `first` and `last` by calling `_get_timestamp_range_edges` with `ax.min()` and `ax.max()` as input. The values of `first` and `last` seem to be correctly computed and are as expected.

Then, the `binner` and `labels` are generated using `date_range` with the calculated `first` and `last` values along with other parameters such as `freq`, `tz`, `name`, `ambiguous`, and `nonexistent`. The values of `binner` and `labels` seem to be computed correctly and match the expected values.

Following that, `ax_values` are generated by accessing the `asi8` property of `ax`. After that, `binner` and `bin_edges` are adjusted using the `_adjust_bin_edges` method. The values of `binner` and `bin_edges` match the expected values based on the input and the operation performed.

Subsequently, the function uses the `lib.generate_bins_dt64` method to calculate `bins` based on `ax_values`, `bin_edges`, `self.closed`, and `ax.hasnans`. The calculated `bins` seem to match the expected output based on the test case.

The code then contains conditional checks to modify `labels` based on the values of `self.closed` and `self.label` and to insert `NaT` if `ax` has nans. These conditional checks seem to work correctly based on the provided input and the values of the variables.

Finally, the function checks if the length of `bins` is less than the length of `labels`, and if so, adjusts `labels` accordingly. This seems to work as expected based on the values observed.

Given the provided inputs and the observed variable values, there are no apparent issues with the function's code. All the variable values and their generation seem to align with the expected behavior of the function. Therefore, it's likely that the problem lies elsewhere, such as how this function is being called, the data being passed to it, or any subsequent processing of its output.
