Looking at the input and output variable values, it seems like the `binner` and `labels` are not being adjusted correctly. The `binner` and `labels` are initialized using the `date_range` function with the `start` and `end` arguments set as `first` and `last` respectively. Additionally, `binner` is being adjusted using the `_adjust_bin_edges` method with the `ax_values`. It looks like the values of `binner` and `labels` are calculated correctly based on the timestamps, frequency, and time zone information provided.

However, the issue seems to be with the `insert` operation on the `binner` and `labels`. The `insert` method is being used to add `NaT` at the beginning of both `binner` and `labels` if `ax.hasnans` is `True`. This operation doesn't seem to be working as expected.

One thing to note is that the `insert` method on a DatetimeIndex returns a new DatetimeIndex, rather than modifying the existing one in place. This means that the `insert` method is creating new DatetimeIndex objects, but the updated values are not being stored in the variables `binner` and `labels`.

To fix this issue, we need to update the `binner` and `labels` variables with the new DatetimeIndex objects returned by the `insert` method. This can be done by assigning the returned values of the `insert` method back to the `binner` and `labels` variables.

Here's the updated code to fix the issue:

```python
if ax.hasnans:
    binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
    labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Update binner and labels with the new DatetimeIndex objects
    binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
    labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)
```

By making this change, the `binner` and `labels` variables should now contain the updated values with `NaT` inserted at the beginning. This should resolve the issue and ensure that the returned `binner` and `labels` variables have the correct values.
