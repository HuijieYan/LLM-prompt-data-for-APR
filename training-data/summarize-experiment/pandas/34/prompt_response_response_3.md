Based on the error message and the test case provided, the issue seems to be related to the handling of Daylight Saving Time (DST) transitions during the resampling process. The `_get_time_bins` function and its associated logic are likely where the issue lies. Specifically, the error is occurring due to the mishandling of DST transitions during the resampling process, leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError`.

The specific datetime `2018-11-04 00:00:00` is causing the DST ambiguity error due to incorrect handling of the repeated times during the DST transition. This indicates that the code is not appropriately handling the DST transition, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

To address this issue, the handling of DST transitions during the resampling process needs to be reviewed and updated to properly handle the ambiguity in time during DST transitions and avoid the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

To resolve the bug, the handling of DST transitions and the ambiguous times during the resampling process should be thoroughly reviewed and updated to address the ambiguity in time during DST transitions.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function, addressing the issue with the `insert` operation and ensuring that the updated values are stored in the `binner` and `labels` variables after calling the `insert` method:
```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        # Update binner and labels with the new DatetimeIndex objects
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```
By making this change, the `binner` and `labels` variables should now contain the updated values with `NaT` inserted at the beginning, resolving the issue of mishandling DST transitions and ambiguous times during the resampling process.
