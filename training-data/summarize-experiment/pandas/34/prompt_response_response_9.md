Based on the test case `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` and the associated error message, the issue is related to the resampling and grouping of a datetime index with ambiguous times due to daylight saving time changes. The error occurs during the groupby and mean calculation of the resampled data.

The code provided in the function `_get_time_bins` seems to perform the necessary operations correctly, including generating `binner`, `bins`, and `labels` based on the datetime index `ax`. Therefore, the bug might be occurring due to the handling of ambiguous times during the resampling process. The issue seems to lie in how the resampling process handles ambiguous times, particularly during the transition from standard time to daylight saving time.

To resolve the error, the resampling process needs to account for ambiguous times caused by daylight saving time changes. This could potentially be achieved by adjusting the frequency used for resampling or modifying the way ambiguous times are handled explicitly during the resampling process to avoid the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

Given the nature of the bug, it may be necessary to explicitly handle the ambiguous times during the resampling process, potentially by using the `ambiguous` parameter in `date_range` or adjusting the frequency to avoid the ambiguous times altogether.

Here's the revised version of the `_get_time_bins` function that addresses the potential issue:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT"  # Handle ambiguous times explicitly by replacing with NaT
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the revised function, the `ambiguous` parameter in the `date_range` function is explicitly set to "NaT" to handle ambiguous times by replacing them with NaT. This should help avoid the `AmbiguousTimeError` during the resampling process.

By replacing ambiguous times with NaT, the function aims to handle the ambiguity explicitly and prevent the error that occurs when encountering ambiguous times during the resampling process. This revised function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version to address the potential issue related to ambiguous times during resampling.
