Based on the test case 'test_quantile_empty_no_columns' and the error message "ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate", it is evident that the bug occurs when attempting to calculate the quantile for an empty DataFrame where all the columns have been dropped.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the call to `data._data.quantile()` when the DataFrame `data` is empty. This triggers an attempt to concatenate empty arrays, leading to the ValueError.

The occurrence of the bug can be attributed to the lack of validation for empty data in the 'quantile' method. Additionally, there is a need to check for sufficient data to perform the quantile calculation, such as calculating quantiles for at least one array or checking for an empty DataFrame and handling it suitably.

To fix the bug, we can:
1. Add a validation check at the beginning of the 'quantile' method to handle the scenario of an empty DataFrame, ensuring that suitable steps are taken to handle empty data.
2. Introduce a check to verify the presence of sufficient data before attempting to perform the quantile calculation. This check can include calculating quantiles for at least one array or checking for an empty DataFrame.

Here's the corrected code for the 'quantile' method:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    """
    Return values at the given quantile over requested axis.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ... (parameters remain the same as in the buggy function)

    Returns
    -------
    Series or DataFrame
    ... (return statements remain the same as in the buggy function)
    """
    self._check_percentile(q)
    
    # New validation check for empty data
    if self.empty:
        raise ValueError("DataFrame is empty. Unable to calculate quantile.")

    data = self._get_numeric_data() if numeric_only else self
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    result = None
    if not data.empty:  # Check for sufficient data before calculating quantile
        result = data._data.quantile(
            qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
        )

    if result is not None:
        if result.ndim == 2:
            result = self._constructor(result)
        else:
            result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

        if is_transposed:
            result = result.T

    return result
```

In the corrected code, we have added a validation check at the beginning of the 'quantile' method to handle empty DataFrames. Additionally, we introduced a check for sufficient data before attempting to perform the quantile calculation.

The corrected function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version to resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
