The buggy function 'quantile' is failing in specific scenarios, as indicated by the test function 'test_quantile_empty_no_columns'. The error message suggests a problem with concatenating arrays due to an empty DataFrame, which aligns with the behavior described in the test case.

Upon analyzing the function, it appears that the method '_get_numeric_data' is failing to retrieve the necessary numeric data, resulting in an empty DataFrame 'data'. This leads to a ValueError when trying to concatenate empty arrays.

The root cause of the issue seems to be the inability to retrieve numeric data correctly. To fix the bug, the method '_get_numeric_data' needs to be debugged and rectified to ensure it can successfully obtain numeric data. Additionally, it's essential to verify the structure and content of the input DataFrame to identify any underlying issues.

To address the bug, a revised version of the function 'quantile' is provided below, incorporating the necessary fix for the issue:

```python
def quantile(self, q=0.5, axis=0, numeric_only=True, interpolation="linear"):
    self._check_percentile(q)
    
    data = self._get_numeric_data().copy() if numeric_only else self.copy()
    axis = self._get_axis_number(axis)
    is_transposed = axis == 1

    if is_transposed:
        data = data.T

    if data.empty:
        return self._constructor_sliced([], index=[], name=q)

    result = data._data.quantile(
        qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed
    )

    if result.ndim == 2:
        result = self._constructor(result)
    else:
        result = self._constructor_sliced(result, name=q)

    if is_transposed:
        result = result.T

    return result
```

In the revised version, the empty DataFrame check is performed after obtaining the numeric data. If the DataFrame is empty, a new DataFrame is created with an empty result and returned immediately. This prevents the concatenation error and ensures correct behavior in scenarios where the input DataFrame is empty.

The described approach addresses the root cause of the bug by handling the empty DataFrame scenario and allows the function to produce the expected output in the given test case.
