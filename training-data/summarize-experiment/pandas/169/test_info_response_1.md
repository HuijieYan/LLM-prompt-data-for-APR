From the error messages, we can recognize that the ValueError is being raised in the `quantile()` function at line 8218 of the `pandas/core/frame.py`. Specifically, the error occurs at `result = data._data.quantile(`. The error message is "ValueError: need at least one array to concatenate".

This suggests that the problem might be within the `data._data.quantile(qs=q, axis=1, interpolation=interpolation, transposed=is_transposed)` line of the original function. 

Looking at the test function `test_quantile_empty_no_columns`, we can see that it creates an empty DataFrame with a column named "captain tightpants" using `df = pd.DataFrame(pd.date_range("1/1/18", periods=5))` and then attempts to use the `quantile()` function with `result = df.quantile(0.5)`.

The error message and the test function both provide crucial information that the function under test is not handling an empty DataFrame correctly.

Therefore, the issue lies probably with the original `quantile()` function when provided with an empty DataFrame. More specifically, the code does not handle the special case of an empty DataFrame effectively, leading to a ValueError when trying to compute quantiles on an empty subset of data. Hence, the handling of empty DataFrames is crucial to resolve the bugs in the `quantile()` function.
