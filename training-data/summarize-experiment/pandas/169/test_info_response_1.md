The test function `test_quantile_empty_no_columns` is written to check the behavior of the `quantile` method when an empty DataFrame (with no columns) is used. The DataFrame `df` is initialized using a date range, and the name of the column is set as "captain tightpants". When calling the `quantile(0.5)` method on this DataFrame, the code encounters an error.

The error message indicates that the problem is originating from the `quantile` method in the pandas core frame.py file. The exact line where the error occurred is line 8218.

The issue seems to be with the `data._data.quantile` function call within the `quantile` method. It is also revealed that the error is specifically in the `concat_compat` function, which is trying to concatenate at least one array.

From this error message, it seems like the `quantile` function is trying to concatenate some arrays, but it is unable to do so because the input arrays are empty. This aligns with the purpose of the test case, as it is testing the behavior of `quantile` when the DataFrame doesn't have any columns.

To investigate further, it's essential to review the `quantile` method inside the pandas core frame.py file. Additionally, the `concat_compat` function and its usage within the method can provide essential insights into what exactly is causing the error.

Further debugging of the `quantile` method and understanding the behavior of `concat_compat` function when dealing with an empty DataFrame is crucial to diagnosing and resolving this issue.
