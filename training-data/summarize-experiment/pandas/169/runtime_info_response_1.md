In the given code, the `quantile` function is used to return values at the given quantile over the requested axis. The function takes several input parameters, such as `q` (quantile), `axis`, `numeric_only`, and `interpolation`, among others.

Based on the provided buggy cases, we have two scenarios to analyze. Let's break down each scenario and provide a detailed narrative based on the observed variable values and the function's code.

### Buggy Case 1:
In this case, the function is called with the following input parameters and variable values:

- `q`: 0.5
- `axis`: 0
- `numeric_only`: True
- `interpolation`: 'linear'
- `self`: A DataFrame
- `self._check_percentile`: A bound method
- `self._get_numeric_data`: A bound method
- `self._get_axis_number`: A bound method
- Other variable values such as `data`, `is_transposed`, `data.T`, `data.columns`, `cols`, and `data._data` are observed at the time of return.

Now, let's examine the code and correlate it with the observed variable values:

1. The `_check_percentile` method is called to validate the quantile input parameter.

2. Based on the value of `numeric_only`, `data` is assigned the result of `_get_numeric_data()` if `numeric_only` is True, otherwise it is assigned `self`.

3. Axis is assigned the result of `_get_axis_number(axis)`. The `is_transposed` flag is set based on the value of `axis`.

4. The `quantile` is then calculated using the `qs` (quantile) parameter, axis, interpolation, and whether the data is transposed or not.

5. The resulting data is then post-processed based on its dimensions and transposition status to return the final result.

### Buggy Case 2:
In this case, the input parameter `q` is a list `[0.5]`, while other input parameters and variable values remain the same as in Buggy Case 1.

Based on the observed variable values and the function's code, the behavior should remain consistent across both scenarios, with the only difference being the input parameter `q`.

In both cases, the problematic behavior seems to stem from the core process of quantile calculation using the `data._data.quantile` method, as well as the subsequent data manipulation and post-processing in the function.

The observed variable values, especially the contents of `data`, `data._data`, and how they change during transposition, seem to be crucial to understanding the buggy behavior.

Further investigation and detailed logging of the `data` content, `result` from the quantile calculation, and the post-processing steps based on the dimensions and transposition status are essential to fix the buggy behavior in the `quantile` function.
