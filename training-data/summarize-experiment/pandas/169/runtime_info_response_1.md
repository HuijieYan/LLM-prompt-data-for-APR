In the provided buggy function `quantile`, two test cases failed to produce the expected output. Let's analyze the code and variable logs to pinpoint the issue causing these test failures.

In the first test case, the input parameter `q` has a value of `0.5` and `numeric_only` is set to `True`. The `self` parameter represents the DataFrame with values related to dates in the year 2018.

The function first calls the method `self._check_percentile` to verify the validity of the percentile value, which seems to complete successfully. The method then proceeds to retrieve the numeric data from the DataFrame using `self._get_numeric_data` and sets the `axis` value to `0`. From the logs, we can see that `data` is an empty DataFrame at this point.

The function then sets the `is_transposed` flag to `False`, indicating that the data is not transposed. Subsequently, it attempts to find the quantile using the method `data._data.quantile`. Here, the issue might be related to the empty `data` DataFrame, possibly resulting in the incorrect output.

In the second test case, the input parameter `q` is now a list `[0.5]`, with the rest of the parameters unchanged. The subsequent flow of the function remains the same as in the previous case, leading to an empty `data` DataFrame.

Based on the logs, it is evident that the issue arises from the fact that `data` is an empty DataFrame. This indicates that the method `_get_numeric_data` fails to retrieve the numeric data successfully, resulting in empty `data`. Therefore, the root cause of the failure seems to be the method `_get_numeric_data`. Possible reasons for this could include a flaw in the logic of `_get_numeric_data` or discrepancies in the data it is trying to retrieve.

To address the issue, you can start by debugging the method `_get_numeric_data` to understand why it returns an empty DataFrame, ensuring it retrieves the needed numeric data correctly. Additionally, consider examining the structure and content of the input DataFrame to determine if there are any underlying issues with the data itself. By resolving these potential issues, you can address the root cause of the failed test cases and ensure the correct functioning of the `quantile` function.
