Based on the provided buggy function code and the logs of input and output variable values, let's analyze the function execution in the two buggy cases.

### Buggy Case 1:
In this case, the input parameters have the following values and types:
- self._check_percentile: a method bound to the DataFrame `captain tightpants`
- self: DataFrame `captain tightpants`
- q: float with value 0.5
- numeric_only: boolean with value True
- self._get_numeric_data: a method bound to the DataFrame `captain tightpants`
- axis: integer with value 0
- self._get_axis_number: a method bound to the class `pandas.core.frame.DataFrame`
- self.columns: a RangeIndex
- self._constructor: a type representing the DataFrame
- self._constructor_sliced: a type representing the Series
- interpolation: string with value 'linear'

Upon analyzing the code, we can see the following operations being performed:
- The method `self._check_percentile` is called, which internally validates the value of `q`.
- If `numeric_only` is True, the method `_get_numeric_data` is called, else the original DataFrame `self` is used.
- The axis is determined using `_get_axis_number` and then checked if it requires transposition.
- The quantile is computed on the numeric data, and based on the dimension of the result, either a DataFrame or a Series is created.

The observed variable values before the return of the function are:
- `data` is an empty DataFrame
- `is_transposed` is False
- `data.T` is also an empty DataFrame
- `cols` and `data.columns` are empty Index objects.
- `data._data` is a BlockManager.

### Buggy Case 2:
In this case, the input parameters are the same as in the first buggy case, except that `q` is now a list with a single float value 0.5.

The function execution will follow the same pattern as in the first case. However, the method `_check_percentile` will need to handle the input differently because of the change in the type of `q` from float to list.

Both the input and output values for the second buggy case are the same as the first case, indicating consistency in the behavior of the function.

Upon examining the function and the input-output variable values, it seems that the problematic behavior might arise from the internal implementation of the functions `_check_percentile`, `_get_numeric_data`, and `_get_axis_number`. Additionally, the behavior of the `block_manager` in the output variable `data._data` needs further inspection to determine if it is correctly initialized and modified during the function execution.

Further analysis such as inspecting the logic inside the methods `_check_percentile`, `_get_numeric_data`, and `_get_axis_number` as well as how the `block_manager` stores and provides data may be instrumental in understanding and resolving the issues observed in the buggy cases. These analyses will aid in debugging the function to address the inconsistencies observed in the logs of input-output variable values.
