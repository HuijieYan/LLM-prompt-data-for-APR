Based on the analysis of the provided information, the bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the incorrect ordering of blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. This leads to the function mistakenly returning `True` when comparing identical blocks with different locations.

The potential error location within the function is the `canonicalize` function, which is responsible for ordering the blocks based on their data type and location. It's possible that the `mgr_locs` attribute of the blocks is not being handled properly in the `canonicalize` function, leading to incorrect ordering.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `canonicalize` function to correctly handle the ordering of blocks based on their data type and location. Additionally, we should verify that the `equals` method correctly compares the blocks.

Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function with the modified `canonicalize` function.

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # modified canonicalize function to correctly order the blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist(), block.dtype.name)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

By modifying the `canonicalize` function to properly order the blocks based on their data type and location, we can address the bug in the `equals` function and ensure that it correctly compares identical blocks with different locations. This corrected version can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.
