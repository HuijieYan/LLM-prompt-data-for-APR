Based on the provided information and analysis, it is apparent that the bug is likely related to the comparison logic within the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class. The method currently compares the axes and blocks of two `BlockManager` objects for equality, and the issue might arise from the comparison process considering only the order of columns and not the actual data values.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic within the `equals` method should be revised to accurately identify differences in the `BlockManager` objects, including cases where the order of axes or blocks differ. Additionally, the comparison should consider the actual data values within the axes and blocks to determine equality.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other existing methods and attributes)

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        self_blocks = {b.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes(): b for b in self.blocks}
        other_blocks = {b.mgr_locs.as_array.tobytes(): b for b in other.blocks}
        if set(self_blocks.keys()) != set(other_blocks.keys()):
            return False

        for key in self_blocks:
            sb = self_blocks[key]
            ob = other_blocks[key]
            if not sb.equals(ob):
                return False

        return True
```

In the corrected code, the following updates have been made:
1. Instead of sorting and comparing the blocks based on a sorting criterion, a dictionary comprehension is used to create a mapping of the blocks' locations to the blocks themselves for both `self` and `other`.
2. We then check if the sets of block locations are equal for both `self` and `other`. If not, it immediately returns `False`.
3. We loop through the block locations and compare the corresponding blocks using the `equals` method. If any pair of blocks is not equal, it immediately returns `False`.
4. If all comparisons pass, the method returns `True`.

This correction addresses the potential issue of not properly comparing the actual data values within the axes and blocks, and ensures that differences in the order of axes or blocks are accurately accounted for.

The corrected code can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.
