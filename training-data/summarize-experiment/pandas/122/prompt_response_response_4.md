Based on the provided information and the test case, it seems that the `equals` function is returning an incorrect result when comparing identical blocks with different locations. This is likely due to the sorting mechanism used within the function, which may not consider block locations. As a result, the function may incorrectly identify the BlockManagers as different when they are actually equivalent.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the sorting mechanism used in the function to consider the actual content of the blocks, rather than just their order or locations. Additionally, we should ensure that the `_consolidate_inplace` method is not altering the essential content of the BlockManagers in a way that affects the equality comparison.

Here is the corrected version of the function `equals`:

```python
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other code) ...

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        
        # Ensure all axes are equal
        for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes):
            if not ax1.equals(ax2):
                return False
        
        # Remove _consolidate_inplace calls
        
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False
        
        # canonicalize block content for comparison
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

        # Check if the sorted blocks are equal
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
            if not block.equals(oblock):
                return False

        return True
```

In this corrected version, the function first ensures that all axes are equal between the `self` and `other` BlockManagers. It then removes the calls to `_consolidate_inplace`, as this method might affect the internal state of the BlockManagers. The function then sorts and compares the blocks based on their content using the `canonicalize` function, which takes into account the values of the blocks in addition to their locations.

This correction aims to provide a more accurate comparison of the BlockManagers, considering the actual content of the blocks rather than just their order or locations. This should resolve the issue of the function incorrectly identifying equivalent BlockManagers as different.
