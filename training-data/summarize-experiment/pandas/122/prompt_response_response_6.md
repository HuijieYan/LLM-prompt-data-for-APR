Based on the input information and the failed test case, it appears that the `equals` function is incorrectly returning `True` when comparing identical blocks with different locations. This behavior contradicts the expected behavior and results in failed test cases.

The potential error location within the `equals` function is the `canonicalize` function, which sorts the blocks based on their data type and location (mgr_locs). The current implementation of the `canonicalize` function might not be correctly ordering the blocks, leading to a failed comparison in the subsequent `all` statement.

The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function may not handle the `mgr_locs` attribute of the blocks properly, resulting in incorrect block ordering. Additionally, the `equals` method might not be correctly comparing the blocks, leading to the inaccurate return value.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function correctly orders the blocks based on their data type and location, considering the `mgr_locs` attribute. Additionally, we need to verify that the `equals` method accurately compares the blocks without being affected by their locations.

Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False

    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In the revised version of the function:
1. The `canonicalize` function orders the blocks based on their data type and location by creating a tuple of `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs.as_array`.
2. The comparison of blocks has been updated to use the `equals` method, ensuring that block comparisons are accurate regardless of their locations.

This corrected function resolves the bug by addressing potential issues in block ordering and comparison, ensuring that the `equals` function returns the correct result when comparing identical blocks with different locations.
