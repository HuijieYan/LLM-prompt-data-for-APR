Based on the provided information and the analysis of the bug, the potential error location within the problematic function seems to be in the comparison logic, especially when sorting and comparing the blocks of the `BlockManager` objects. It is likely that the `equals` method of the block objects is not accurately identifying the differences between the blocks, leading to the incorrect comparison results.

The bug seems to be occurring due to the incorrect handling of block comparisons and the sorting mechanism used within the `equals` method. When comparing the blocks, the sorting based on the type name and `mgr_locs` may not be accurately capturing the differences between the DataFrames, resulting in the method returning `True` when it should return `False`.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic within the `equals` method needs to be revised to accurately identify differences in DataFrames, including cases where the columns or block types are in different positions. Additionally, the comparison of individual blocks and the sorting mechanism should be refined to ensure the correct identification of differences between the DataFrames.

Below is the corrected version of the `equals` method that addresses the bug:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (str(type(block)), block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
In this corrected version of the function, the `canonicalize` function now uses `str(type(block))` to capture the type name of the block, and `block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist()` to capture the location information. This approach should help in accurately identifying and sorting the blocks based on their type and location, leading to a correct comparison of the DataFrames.

The revised function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version to resolve the issue.
