## Summary of the Bug

The bug is related to the `DataFrame.equals()` method in the pandas library. When comparing two DataFrames using this method, it incorrectly returns `True` in cases where the two DataFrames have identical data but with different column locations.

## Code Sample
```
version: 3.6.8
# Your code here
df3 = pd.DataFrame({'a': [1, 2], 'b': ['s', 'd']})
df4 = pd.DataFrame({'a': ['s', 'd'], 'b': [1, 2]})
df3.equals(df4)
```

## Problem Description
The issue arises when using the `equals()` method to compare two DataFrames `df3` and `df4`. Despite the fact that the data in the DataFrames is the same, the method incorrectly returns `True`. The expected output should be `False`.

## Environment
- Python: 3.6.8
- pandas: 0.25.0
- numpy: 1.16.4
- OS: Windows 10 64-bit

## Proposed Solution
The bug likely originates from the comparison logic within the `equals()` method. It should be adjusted to consider the actual data values and not just the column locations. It's recommended to revise the comparison algorithm to accurately identify differences in DataFrames, including cases where the columns are in different positions.

This analysis provides clarity on the bug and suggests a modification to the comparison process within the `equals()` method, aiming to enhance the accuracy and reliability of DataFrame comparisons.
