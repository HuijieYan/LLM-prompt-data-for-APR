From the provided information, we can see that the input parameters `self_axes` and `other_axes` are lists containing `Index` and `RangeIndex` objects. These variables represent the axes of the input `BlockManager` objects `self` and `other`, respectively. The `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` variables are tuples of `IntBlock` and `ObjectBlock` objects, which are the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects.

Based on the comparison in the buggy function, the first `if` statement checks the length of `self_axes` and `other_axes`. Since their lengths are the same, this condition is satisfied.

The next `if` statement compares all elements of `self_axes` and `other_axes` using the `equals` method. If this condition fails, the function returns `False`. However, the provided input values indicate that the axes of `self` and `other` are identical, so this condition should not be the cause of the failed test cases.

After that, both `self` and `other` are consolidated in place using the `_consolidate_inplace` method. This step should not affect the comparison of the blocks, as it simply reorganizes the internal representation of the data.

The next check verifies that the number of blocks in `self` and `other` are the same. Since the number of blocks is the same in both cases, this condition is also satisfied.

The subsequent block sorting, using the `canonicalize` function, orders the blocks based on their data type and location. The comparison then iterates through the blocks using the `equals` method. This seems to be the crucial part of the function where the comparison is being made.

However, when we look at the values of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`, and the values of `block` and `oblock` within the `canonicalize` function, the values and types seem to be inconsistent with the expectations. It is possible that the `canonicalize` function is not correctly ordering the blocks, leading to a failed comparison in the subsequent `all` statement.

To debug this issue, we need to focus on the `canonicalize` function and check if it is correctly ordering the blocks based on their data type and location. It's possible that the `mgr_locs` attribute of the blocks is not being handled properly in the `canonicalize` function, leading to incorrect ordering. Additionally, we should verify that the `equals` method is correctly comparing the blocks.

By examining the specific behavior of the `canonicalize` function and the `equals` method, we can identify and fix the root cause of the failed test cases.
