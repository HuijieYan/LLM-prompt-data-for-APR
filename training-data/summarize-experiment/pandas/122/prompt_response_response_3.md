The potential error location within the `equals` method is likely in the comparison of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. It is possible that the comparison logic within the `equals` method is not correctly identifying differences between the blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects, resulting in the incorrect return value.

The bug is occurring because the current comparison logic within the `equals` method is not accurately identifying differences when comparing the blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects. This results in the method incorrectly returning `True` even when the actual data in the blocks are different.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic within the `equals` method needs to be updated to accurately compare the blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects. It should consider the actual data values within the blocks and not just their positions.

Here is the corrected version of the `equals` method that resolves the issue:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other methods and attributes)

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # Sort blocks using a key that combines data type and locations
        def key_function(block):
            return (block.dtype, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=key_function)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=key_function)

        return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
```

This revised version of the `equals` method addresses the bug by ensuring that the comparison logic accurately compares the blocks of the two `BlockManager` objects based on their actual data values. This should resolve the issue of the method incorrectly returning `True` when comparing DataFrames with identical data but different column locations.
