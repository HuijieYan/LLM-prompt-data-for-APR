Based on the provided information, the bug in the `equals` function seems to be related to the sorting of blocks in the `self` and `other` instances of the `BlockManager` class. The comparison of blocks fails due to incorrect ordering based on the `canonicalize` function.

The `canonicalize` function should correctly order the blocks based on their data type and location. The sorting based on the tuple `(block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())` appears to be causing the issue. It's likely that the `mgr_locs` attribute is not being handled properly or is not appropriately distinguishing between unconsolidated blocks.

To fix the bug in the function, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function correctly considers the `mgr_locs` attribute of the blocks for ordering. Additionally, we should verify that the `equals` method correctly compares the blocks.

Here is the revised version of the `equals` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and mgr_locs to ensure correct ordering
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this revised version, the `canonicalize` function now uses the block's `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` directly for sorting, without converting `mgr_locs` to a list. This should ensure correct ordering of blocks based on their data type and location, addressing the bug in the original function.

The revised `equals` function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
