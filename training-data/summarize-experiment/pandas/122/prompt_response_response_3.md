The test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` is asserting that `df1.equals(df2)` should return False since the dataframes `df1` and `df2` have different values for the same keys. However, the actual assertion error shows that the function returned True instead of False.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the block comparison part, where it sorts the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` based on the `canonicalize` function and then compares if each block in `self_blocks` equals the corresponding block in `other_blocks`.

The bug occurs because the comparison of blocks does not take into account the actual data within the blocks, rather it only relies on the block attributes for comparison. This can lead to situations where two different blocks with the same attributes are considered equal, even if their actual data is different.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the comparison logic within the function to compare the actual data within the blocks, rather than just their attributes. This can be achieved by extending the comparison to the data within the blocks, ensuring that the comparison is based on both the attributes and the content of the blocks.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    for i, block in enumerate(self_blocks):
        if not block.equals(other_blocks[i]):
            return False
    return True
```

In the corrected code, we iterate through the sorted blocks and compare each block in `self_blocks` with the corresponding block in `other_blocks`. If any pair of blocks are not equal, the function returns False. Otherwise, if all comparisons pass, the function returns True indicating that the two BlockManager objects are equal.
