Potential Error Location:
The issue with the `equals` function likely lies in the `canonicalize` function, which is used to sort the blocks based on their data type and location. It is possible that the `mgr_locs` attribute of the blocks is not being handled properly in the `canonicalize` function, leading to incorrect ordering.

Reasons for the Bug:
The bug occurs because the `canonicalize` function might not correctly order the blocks based on their data type and location. This leads to incorrect comparison of the blocks in the subsequent `all` statement, causing the `equals` function to return `True` when it should return `False`.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Check and correct the implementation of the `canonicalize` function to ensure that it properly orders the blocks based on their data type and location.
2. Verify that the `equals` method is correctly comparing the sorted blocks.

The following is the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block), block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code:
1. The `canonicalize` function now includes the block type, dtype name, and mgr_locs in the tuple for sorting the blocks.
2. The`self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are sorted based on the updated `canonicalize` function.
3. The comparison of blocks is performed using the `equals` method, ensuring that the sorted blocks are correctly compared.

This revised version of the function resolves the issue by addressing the sorting and comparison of blocks in a way that reflects their actual data type and location.
