The potential error location within the `equals` function is the comparison of the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `equals` method. This is a critical part of the function where the actual comparison between blocks is performed.

The bug occurs because the comparison logic within the `equals` method does not accurately account for differences in the order of columns within the DataFrames. The current implementation only compares the blocks based on their sorting criterion, which does not consider the actual data values and their positions. As a result, DataFrames with the same data but different column locations are incorrectly considered equal.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to modify the comparison algorithm within the `equals` method to consider both the data values and their positions. This can involve updating the sorting criterion used for `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` or enhancing the block comparison process to account for the actual DataFrame content and structure.

Here is the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (tuple(block.dtypes), block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `canonicalize` function now combines the `dtype` attribute of the block into a tuple, and includes the `mgr_locs` attribute as well. This ensures that the sorting order takes into account not only the type name but also the locations of the blocks.

Additionally, the comparison between `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` now uses the updated sorting, and the `equals` method is used to compare each pair of blocks.

This revised version of the function addresses the bug by improving the comparison logic to consider both the type of data and its position within the DataFrames.
