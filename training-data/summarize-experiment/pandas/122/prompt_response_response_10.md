Based on the test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` and the error message, it seems that the buggy function `equals` is incorrectly returning True even when the DataFrames `df1` and `df2` are not equal. This indicates a bug in the functionality of the `equals` method for BlockManager objects.

Upon analyzing the buggy function, it is evident that the comparison is based on the axes and blocks of the BlockManager objects. The bug could potentially be occurring in the comparison of the blocks or in the sorting process using the `canonicalize` function, as these are the areas where the error might have originated.

The error message is related to the assertion of `df1.equals(df2) is False`, where the expected result is False but the actual output is True, which indicates a bug in the equality comparison logic within the `equals` method. This could be due to the comparison of identical blocks with different locations returning True, which is incorrect.

To fix this bug, one approach could be to revise the logic for comparing the blocks in the `equals` function. It might involve restructuring the comparison process to ensure that identical blocks with different locations are not treated as equal. Additionally, there might be a need to revisit the sorting logic and the implementation of the `canonicalize` function to ensure accurate comparison and sorting based on block attributes.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other methods and attributes)

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        def canonicalize(block):
            return (str(type(block)), id(block))

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

        return all(block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks))
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now uses the type and the unique block identifier (here, the memory address using `id(block)`) for sorting the blocks. This ensures that blocks with identical content but different locations will not be treated as equal during comparison.

This revised implementation should address the bug by providing a more accurate comparison and sorting process for the blocks within the BlockManager objects.
