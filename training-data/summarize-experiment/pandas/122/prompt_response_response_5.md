Based on the provided information and analysis, it seems that the bug is likely occurring within the `canonicalize` function, which is used to sort the blocks based on their data type and location. It's possible that the `mgr_locs` attribute of the blocks is not being handled properly in the `canonicalize` function, leading to incorrect block ordering and subsequent failed comparisons.

To fix this bug, it's necessary to ensure that the `canonicalize` function correctly orders the blocks based on their data type and location. Additionally, it's important to verify that the `equals` method is correctly comparing the blocks, as any inconsistencies in the comparison can lead to a false positive result.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.equals(oblock):
            return False

    return True
```

In this corrected version, we've added an additional check to ensure that the lengths of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` are equal after sorting. Then, we iterate through the blocks and compare each pair using the `equals` method, returning `False` if any pair of blocks are not equal. If all block pairs are equal, the function returns `True` as expected.

This corrected implementation should resolve the issue of the `equals` method wrongly returning `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.
