The error in the `equals` function seems to be related to the comparison of the blocks within the `BlockManager` objects. Given the context, the bug could be caused by comparing blocks with identical data but different locations, resulting in the `equals` function incorrectly returning True.

One possible approach to fix this bug is to modify the comparison process for the blocks. Instead of directly comparing the blocks, we can consider comparing the data within the blocks to ensure that the actual data values match, regardless of their internal locations.

Here's the revised version of the `equals` function that addresses this issue:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # Sort and compare blocks
        def cmp_block_data(block1, block2):
            return block1.values.equals(block2.values)

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            cmp_block_data(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In this revised version, the comparison process has been updated. The blocks are sorted based on the `canonicalize` function, but the comparison between the blocks is now based on their actual data values, accessed using the `values` attribute.

With this change, the `equals` function will now compare the actual data within the blocks, rather than relying on the internal locations of the blocks. This should address the issue of the function incorrectly returning True for blocks with identical data but different locations.

Please integrate this revised version of the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
