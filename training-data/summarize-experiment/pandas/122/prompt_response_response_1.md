The `equals` function is intended to compare two `BlockManager` objects and determine if they are equal. The current implementation of the function has a bug which causes it to return `True` when it should return `False` in some cases, as evidenced by the failing test case provided. The failure occurs when comparing identical blocks within `BlockManager` objects with different locations.

Upon analysis, it appears that the issue is most likely within the `canonicalize` function. The `canonicalize` function sorts the blocks based on their data type and location. It's possible that the sorting logic within `canonicalize` is not correctly ordering the blocks, which leads to the failed comparison within the subsequent code.

To address this issue, the `canonicalize` function needs to be adjusted to correctly order the blocks based on their data type and location. Additionally, we should verify that the `equals` method is correctly comparing the blocks.

Below is the corrected version of the `equals` function with the necessary adjustments to the `canonicalize` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # Adjusted implementation of canonicalize function
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, id(block))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the corrected code, the `canonicalize` function now uses the type of the block (`type(block).__name__`) and the unique identifier of the block (`id(block)`) to create a tuple for sorting. This ensures that the blocks are ordered based on their data type and location.

With these adjustments, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the `BlockManager` objects, and the failing test case should pass as expected.
