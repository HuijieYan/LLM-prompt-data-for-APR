The potential error in the `equals` method lies in the comparison of the blocks after sorting them using the `canonicalize` function. It seems that the comparison does not consider the actual data values of the blocks and instead relies solely on the order and type of the blocks.

The bug may be occurring because the comparison of blocks in the `equals` method does not accurately identify differences in the data when comparing two BlockManager objects. This discrepancy leads to the method incorrectly returning `True` when the expected result should be `False`. Additionally, the sorting of blocks based on the type name and `mgr_locs` may not be the most accurate way to determine equality between the block data.

To fix the bug, the comparison logic within the `equals` method should be revised to consider the actual data values of the blocks. Instead of relying solely on the type name and `mgr_locs` for sorting and comparison, the method should compare the contents of the blocks to accurately determine equality. This adjustment will ensure that the `equals` method returns the expected result when comparing two BlockManager objects that have identical data but in different block locations.

Here's the corrected version of the `equals` method that addresses the bug:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other class code)

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=lambda block: block.values)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In the corrected code:
- The sorting of blocks is based on the actual values (`block.values`) rather than the type name and `mgr_locs`.
- The comparison of blocks now considers the content of the blocks by using the `equals` method, ensuring an accurate comparison.

The revised `equals` method resolves the bug by addressing the comparison logic and sorting mechanism, resulting in accurate equality comparisons between BlockManager objects.
