The "equals" function takes in two parameters, "self" and "other", both of type BlockManager. It first compares the axes of both BlockManagers and returns False if they have different lengths or if any of the corresponding axes are not equal. 

It then consolidates both BlockManagers in place and checks if the number of blocks within each BlockManager is the same. If not, it returns False.

The function then defines a "canonicalize" function that takes a block and returns a tuple of the block's dtype name and mgr_locs. It then sorts the blocks of both BlockManagers using this "canonicalize" function and checks if all corresponding blocks are equal.

To summarize, the function first checks the axes and block count, then consolidates the BlockManagers, sorts and compares the blocks, and returns True if all conditions are met, and False otherwise.
