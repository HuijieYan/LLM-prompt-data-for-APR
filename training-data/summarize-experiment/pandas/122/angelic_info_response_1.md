Summary:
The given function 'equals' takes two input parameters, 'self' and 'other', which are both BlockManager objects. The function first checks if the axes of both BlockManagers are of the same length. If not, it returns False. Then, it checks if all the elements of the axes are equal using the 'equals' method, and if not, it returns False. 

After that, both BlockManagers are consolidated in place, and the function compares the lengths of their 'blocks'. If the lengths are not equal, it returns False. Next, the function sorts the 'blocks' of both BlockManagers using the 'canonicalize' function, which combines the type name and 'mgr_locs' of the blocks.

Finally, the function checks if each block of 'self_blocks' equals the corresponding block in 'other_blocks'. If any of the blocks are not equal, it returns False. If all the comparisons pass, the function returns True.
