The test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` is checking whether the `equals` method correctly identifies that two DataFrames `df1` and `df2` are not equal. The error message indicates that the `equals` method is returning `True` instead of `False` for this test case, which is incorrect.

The potential error location within the `equals` function is the sorting of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` using the `canonicalize` function and the subsequent comparison of the sorted blocks.

The bug may be occurring because the `canonicalize` function is not correctly ordering the blocks based on their data type and location. Additionally, the `equals` method may not be correctly comparing the blocks after they are sorted.

To fix the bug, we can modify the `canonicalize` function to properly order the blocks based on their data type and location. Additionally, we need to ensure that the `equals` method accurately compares the blocks after they have been sorted.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.__iter__()))

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

The `canonicalize` function has been modified to create a tuple of the block's data type name and the locations of the block using `mgr_locs.__iter__()`. This should ensure that the blocks are correctly ordered for comparison.

This updated function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
