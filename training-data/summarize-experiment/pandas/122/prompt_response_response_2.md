Based on the provided information, the bug in the `equals` method of the `BlockManager` class seems to be related to the comparison and sorting of the blocks within the `blocks` attribute. The function is not correctly handling the comparison of blocks between two `BlockManager` objects, which leads to incorrect equality checks.

To address this issue, the comparison logic within the `equals` method needs to be re-evaluated to accurately compare the blocks of two `BlockManager` objects. Additionally, the sorting mechanism using the `canonicalize` function needs to consider the actual data values and not just the type name and `mgr_locs`.

It's important to review and potentially revise the `equals` method and the `canonicalize` function to ensure that the comparison and sorting accurately reflect the equality of two `BlockManager` objects.

Here's the revised version of the `equals` method that addresses the identified issue:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # canonicalize block order based on data values
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In the revised version, the `canonicalize` function now considers the actual data values within the blocks for sorting. This should accurately reflect the equality of two `BlockManager` objects based on their block content.

This revised `equals` method can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy `equals` method to resolve the identified issue.
