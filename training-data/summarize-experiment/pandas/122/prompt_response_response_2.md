The error in the given function `equals` seems to occur during the comparison of `self_blocks` and `other_blocks`. The code snippet performs sorting and then uses the `equals` method of the block object to compare the blocks. It appears that the issue lies in the comparison logic, specifically when using the `equals` method.

It is possible that the issue arises from the incorrect configuration of the comparisons based on block contents. It seems that the equal comparison check is expecting different data types or contents within the blocks, resulting in the unexpected True return value for the `df1.equals(df2)` test case.

To address this issue, it may be useful to redefine the block-level equality comparison logic, inspecting the expected behavior when comparing blocks of different data types. It is important to review the behavior of the `equals` method of the block object to ensure that it correctly handles comparisons for different types of blocks.

Considering the implementation details and the provided context, the corrected code for the `equals` function in the `BlockManager` class could be as follows:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    # comparing the axes
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    # consolidate the BlockManagers in place
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    # comparing the length of blocks
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False
    
    # define a key function for sorting blocks
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # comparing the sorted blocks
    if len(self_blocks) != len(other_blocks):
        return False
    else:
        for i in range(len(self_blocks)):
            if not self_blocks[i].equals(other_blocks[i]):
                return False

    # if all comparisons passed, return True
    return True
```

This corrected code handles the comparison between blocks more explicitly and iterates through the sorted blocks to ensure that the `equals` method is used correctly, returning False if any blocks are found to be different.

It is important to note that this corrected code assumes that the `equals` method of the block object correctly handles comparisons for different types of blocks. If there are issues with the `equals` method itself, those would need to be addressed separately.
