Based on the analysis of the test case and the error message, the potential error location within the `equals` function is related to the comparison of the `blocks` attribute. The comparison logic within the function may not accurately identify differences in the DataFrames, leading to incorrect results.

The bug likely occurs due to the comparison algorithm within the `equals` function, which may not consider the actual data values and only focuses on the column locations. This can lead to incorrect comparison results, especially when the column order is different between the DataFrames.

To fix the bug, the comparison algorithm within the `equals` function should be revised to accurately identify differences in DataFrames, including cases where the columns are in different positions. This revision should ensure that the comparison takes into account the actual data values in addition to the column locations.

Here is the corrected code for the `equals` function incorporating the suggested fix:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.values, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        pd.testing.assert_frame_equal(block, oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```
