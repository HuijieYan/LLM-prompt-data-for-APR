Based on the given information and the provided buggy function, it appears that the issue lies in the comparison of the blocks in the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists. The comparison is currently done using the `equals` method, which may not be suitable for comparing blocks with identical content but different locations. 

To address this issue, we can modify the comparison process to directly compare the content of the blocks instead of relying on the `equals` method, which may not handle the comparison correctly for blocks with identical content but different locations.

The possible approach for fixing the bug involves modifying the comparison of blocks within the `self_blocks` and `other_blocks` lists. Instead of using the `equals` method, we can directly compare the content of the blocks to handle cases where blocks have identical content but different locations.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function, incorporating the suggested fix:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    # Comparison of blocks based on their content
    for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
        if not block.values.equals(oblock.values):
            return False

    return True
```

In the corrected code, we've replaced the comparison of blocks using the `equals` method with a direct comparison of the content of the blocks. This change addresses the issue of comparing blocks with identical content but different locations.

By implementing this fix, the `equals` function should now correctly compare the content of the blocks within the `self` and `other` BlockManager objects and return the appropriate result.
