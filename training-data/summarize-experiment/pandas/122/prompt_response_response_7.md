Based on the provided information, it seems that the issue lies in the `canonicalize` function that is used for sorting the blocks in the `equals` function. The `canonicalize` function should correctly order the blocks based on their data type and location, but it seems that it may not be handling the `mgr_locs` attribute of the blocks properly, leading to incorrect ordering.

One possible approach to fixing this bug is to ensure that the `canonicalize` function correctly orders the blocks based on their data type and location. Additionally, we should verify that the `equals` method is correctly comparing the blocks.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, tuple(block.mgr_locs.as_array))
    
    # Sort blocks based on canonicalize function
    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this revised version, the `canonicalize` function now correctly orders the blocks based on their `dtype.name` and `mgr_locs` by converting `mgr_locs` to a tuple. Also, the comparison of blocks in the `all` statement uses the `equals` method, ensuring that the correct comparison is performed.

This revised version can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function, resolving the issue with `DataFrame.equals()` wrongly returning `True` in case of identical blocks with different locations.
