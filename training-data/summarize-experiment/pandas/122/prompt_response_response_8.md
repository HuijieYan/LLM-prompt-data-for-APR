Based on the information provided, it seems that the issue lies in the `canonicalize` function, which is used to order the blocks based on their data type and location. Additionally, the `equals` method may not be correctly comparing the blocks after they are sorted.

The reason for the failed test cases could be related to the fact that the `canonicalize` function is not correctly ordering the blocks based on their data type and location. This could lead to incorrect ordering, causing the subsequent comparison in the `equals` method to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function correctly orders the blocks based on their data type and location. Additionally, we should verify that the `equals` method is correctly comparing the blocks after they have been sorted.

Here's the revised version of the function that addresses the bug:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block._combine_type, block.mgr_locs)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In the revised version, the `canonicalize` function now uses the block's `_combine_type` and `mgr_locs` to create a tuple for sorting. This should address the incorrect ordering of blocks. Additionally, the comparison in the `all` statement has been updated to correctly compare the sorted blocks.

This corrected version of the function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version to fix the issue reported in the GitHub test case.
