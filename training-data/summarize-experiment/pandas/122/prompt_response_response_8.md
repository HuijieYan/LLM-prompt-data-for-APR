The error message "assert True is False" in the test case `test_dataframe_not_equal` indicates that the `equals` method is returning True when it should be returning False. This means that the comparison performed by the `equals` method is not accurately identifying the differences between the two DataFrame objects.

The potential error location within the `equals` function could be the comparison of the blocks after sorting. It is possible that the `equals` method of the block objects does not accurately account for the differences in the locations of the identical blocks.

The bug likely occurs because the `equals` method is not taking into account the potential difference in locations of identical blocks between the two BlockManager objects. Identical blocks located at different positions should not be considered equal, but this nuance might not be addressed in the current implementation of the `equals` method.

To fix the bug, the `equals` method should incorporate logic to compare the locations of identical blocks as well. This can be achieved by modifying the `canonicalize` function to consider not only the `dtype.name` of the block but also its location. Additionally, the `equals` method of the block objects should be checked to ensure it compares the blocks including their locations.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) and self_blocks.index(block) == other_blocks.index(oblock)
        for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this corrected version, the `canonicalize` function now includes the locations of the blocks in the tuple. Additionally, the return statement includes a check for the index of each block in the sorted list, ensuring that the blocks are in the same positions in both `self` and `other`.

This should address the bug by accurately comparing the identical blocks with their respective locations. The corrected comparison logic ensures that the `equals` method properly identifies differences between the two BlockManager objects.
