The potential error location within the `equals` method is likely the comparison logic for the blocks of the `BlockManager` objects. The current implementation may not accurately handle comparisons of blocks with different column locations.

The bug is likely occurring because the comparison algorithm does not consider the actual data values and instead focuses only on the column locations. This leads to the `equals` method incorrectly returning `True` in cases where the data in the DataFrames is the same but with different column locations.

To fix the bug, the comparison algorithm within the `equals` method should be revised to accurately identify differences in the DataFrames, including cases where the columns are in different positions. This can be achieved by considering the actual data values in addition to the column locations.

Below is the corrected code for the `equals` method:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... other methods ...

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # Canonicalize block order by combining type name and mgr_locs
        def canonicalize(block):
            return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)

        if any(block1.shape != block2.shape for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)):
            return False

        for block1, block2 in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks):
            if not block1.equals(block2):
                return False

        return True
```

In the corrected code:
1. The `equals` method now checks if the shapes of the blocks are equal, in addition to sorting and comparing them based on the type name and mgr_locs.
2. After sorting, the method iterates through each pair of blocks to verify if they are equal.
3. If any block is not equal in shape or content, the method returns False.
4. If all comparisons pass, the method returns True.

This revised implementation addresses the bug by considering both the column locations and the actual data values during the comparison process, resulting in more accurate DataFrame comparisons.
