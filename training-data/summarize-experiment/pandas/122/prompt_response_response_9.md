Based on the provided information, it seems that the issue with the `equals` function lies in the `canonicalize` function, which sorts the blocks based on their data type and location. It's likely that the `mgr_locs` attribute of the blocks is not being handled properly, leading to incorrect ordering and subsequent failed comparison.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the `canonicalize` function correctly orders the blocks based on their data type and location. Additionally, we should verify that the `equals` method correctly compares the blocks.

Here's the corrected code for the `equals` function including the necessary modifications:

```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type name and mgr_locs
    # ensuring correct sorting based on data type and location
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (type(block).__name__, block.mgr_locs.__dict__)

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )
```

In this revised code, the `canonicalize` function now uses the type name and the `mgr_locs` attribute of the block to create a tuple for sorting. This should ensure that the blocks are correctly ordered based on their data type and location, addressing the root cause of the bug.

Please use this corrected version as a drop-in replacement for the buggy function. This fix should resolve the issue with the `equals` method and ensure that it correctly compares the blocks.
