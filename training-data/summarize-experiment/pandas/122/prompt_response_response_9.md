Based on the provided information, the buggy function `equals` is part of the `BlockManager` class in the pandas library. The function compares two `BlockManager` objects based on their axes and blocks.

The bug in the function appears to be related to the comparison of blocks between the two `BlockManager` objects. Specifically, the sorting of blocks using the `canonicalize` function and the subsequent comparison of individual blocks using the `equals` method seems to be the likely source of the bug.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the sorting of blocks and their comparison is done correctly. Additionally, it's important to consider the comparison of blocks based on their actual data values, not just their locations or types.

Here's the revised version of the `equals` function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... (other class methods and attributes) ...

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the data values
        def canonicalize(block):
            return str(block.values)

        self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
        return all(
            block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In the revised function, we've updated the `canonicalize` function to use the `values` attribute of the blocks to create a unique representation for sorting. This ensures that the comparison is based on the actual data values within the blocks.

Additionally, the comparison of blocks in the `return` statement now compares each block's data values using the `equals` method, ensuring that the comparison is accurate.

This corrected code addresses the bug in the `equals` function by improving the sorting and comparison of blocks based on their data values, providing a more reliable comparison between `BlockManager` objects.
