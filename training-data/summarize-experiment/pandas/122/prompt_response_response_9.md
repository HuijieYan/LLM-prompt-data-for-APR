After analyzing the given information, it seems that the issue might be related to the comparison of the blocks within the BlockManager objects. The function compares the blocks based on their order, dtype name, and mgr_locs, which might not be the correct approach for checking equality. Since the function sorts and compares the blocks based on dtype name and mgr_locs, it might fail to recognize identical blocks with different locations.

To fix this bug, it may be necessary to modify the way the function compares the blocks. Instead of comparing the blocks based on their order and mgr_locs, it would be more appropriate to directly compare the values within the blocks for equality.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class BlockManager(PandasObject):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def equals(self, other):
        self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
        if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
            return False
        if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
            return False
        self._consolidate_inplace()
        other._consolidate_inplace()
        if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
            return False

        self_blocks = self.blocks
        other_blocks = other.blocks
        # compare blocks directly for equality
        return all(
            np.array_equal(self_block.values, other_block.values)
            for self_block, other_block in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
        )
```

In the corrected code, the comparison of blocks has been modified to directly compare the values within the blocks using `np.array_equal()`. This ensures that the function checks for equality of the actual block values, irrespective of their order or mgr_locs.

This should address the bug where the function might incorrectly return True for identical blocks with different locations. The corrected function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
