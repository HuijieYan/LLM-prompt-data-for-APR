Given the source code of a function that exhibits bugs, along with the source code of its corresponding test function and the error messages resulting from the execution of a failed test case, your task is to meticulously extract and articulate relevant and critical information from both the test code and the error messages. This detailed narrative is essential for accurately diagnosing and resolving the errors within the buggy function. To enhance the precision of your analysis, you are encouraged to directly reference specific segments of both the buggy function's code and the test code. It is also advisable, for the sake of clarity, to sometimes focus on only the most pertinent portions of the test function code, omitting sections that do not directly contribute to understanding the problem at hand. Your output should be thorough and elaborative. This approach aims to encourage a comprehensive and profound exploration of the provided code and error messages.

The following is the buggy function code:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )

```

The followings are test functions under directory `pandas/tests/internals/test_internals.py` in the project.
```python
def test_dataframe_not_equal():
    # see GH28839
    df1 = pd.DataFrame({"a": [1, 2], "b": ["s", "d"]})
    df2 = pd.DataFrame({"a": ["s", "d"], "b": [1, 2]})
    assert df1.equals(df2) is False
```

The error message that corresponds the the above test functions is:
```
def test_dataframe_not_equal():
        # see GH28839
        df1 = pd.DataFrame({"a": [1, 2], "b": ["s", "d"]})
        df2 = pd.DataFrame({"a": ["s", "d"], "b": [1, 2]})
>       assert df1.equals(df2) is False
E       assert True is False
E        +  where True = <bound method NDFrame.equals of    a  b\n0  1  s\n1  2  d>(   a  b\n0  s  1\n1  d  2)
