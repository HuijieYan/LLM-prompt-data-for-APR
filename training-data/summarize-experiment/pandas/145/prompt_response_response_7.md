Based on the provided information and the test case `test_td64_op_nat_casting`, the error occurs when performing the element-wise multiplication operation within the `dispatch_to_series` function. The specific error message "TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'" indicates that there is an issue with handling the multiplication operation involving an array and 'NaTType'. Upon further analysis, it seems that the function lacks proper handling for 'NaTType' when performing the arithmetic operation.

The potential error location within the function is in the `column_op` function, which is defined based on the type of `right`, and is used to perform the operation on the DataFrame columns and the Series or scalar.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the function does not handle the specific case of performing element-wise multiplication involving a Series with 'NaTType' values and a DataFrame. This results in a type error when attempting to perform the operation.

To fix the bug, it's necessary to update the `column_op` function to handle the case of 'NaTType' when performing the arithmetic operation. This can involve checking for 'NaT' values and applying the operation accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            if isinstance(b, pd.Timedelta) and pd.isnull(b):
                return {i: b for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            else:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
``` 

In the corrected code, the `column_op` function now includes a conditional check to handle 'NaTType' values when performing the operation. If the value is 'NaT', it returns a dictionary with the same 'NaT' value for each column index. Otherwise, it proceeds with the original operation.

This corrected code addresses the specific issue identified and provides a fix for the bug observed in the `dispatch_to_series` function.
