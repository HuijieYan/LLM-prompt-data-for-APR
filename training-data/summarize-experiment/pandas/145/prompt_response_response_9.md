The error message "TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'" is related to the test function `test_td64_op_nat_casting` where the DataFrame `df` is multiplied by the Series `ser`. The test aims to prevent timedelta64(NaT) from being treated as datetime64 when using the `dispatch_to_series` method in DataFrame arithmetic.

The potential error location within the `dispatch_to_series` function is the operation of `func(a.iloc[:, i], b)` within the `column_op` function. It seems that the function is unable to handle the multiplication operation involving an array and 'NaTType', resulting in the TypeError.

The occurrence of the bug is likely due to a lack of proper handling for timedelta64(NaT) when performing arithmetic operations within the `column_op` function. This is causing the multiplication operation to fail, leading to the TypeError.

To fix the bug, the `column_op` function should be updated to handle the specific case of timedelta64(NaT) when performing arithmetic operations. This update should include checks and appropriate handling for timedelta64(NaT) to prevent the TypeError from occurring.

Here's the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function that resolves the issue:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            if isinstance(b, Timedelta) and pd.isna(b):
                return {i: pd.NaT for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            else:
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected code, within the `column_op` function, a check is added to handle the specific case of timedelta64(NaT). If the type of `b` is `Timedelta` and it's NaN, the function returns a dictionary containing NaT for each column index. Otherwise, it continues to perform the arithmetic operation as before. This modification ensures proper handling of timedelta64(NaT) to prevent the TypeError.
