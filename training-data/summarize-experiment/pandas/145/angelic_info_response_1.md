In the given buggy function code, we have a function called `dispatch_to_series` that is designed to evaluate a frame operation using the `func` parameter, which can be an arithmetic or comparison operator. The function works column-by-column and dispatches to the Series implementation.

When analyzing the expected return value in tests, we can see that the input parameters are `left`, `right`, `func`, `str_rep`, and `axis`. For example, `right` is a Series with a specific value and type, `func` is a built-in function or method, and `axis` is a string.

The function then goes through a series of conditional statements based on the type of `right` and `axis`. It defines a `column_op` function specific to the type of `right`, which is then used within the `expressions.evaluate` function.

From the expected variable values, we can see that the `column_op` function accesses and manipulates elements from the input DataFrames and Series, utilizing iloc to access columns. It then uses the `func` operation on the selected elements and returns a dictionary of results, with each key corresponding to a column index.

The ultimate return value of the function is the result of the evaluation using the `expressions.evaluate` function, which processes the `column_op` function.

In summary, the `dispatch_to_series` function evaluates the frame operation column-by-column by using the `column_op` function specific to the type of `right`, and then utilizes the `expressions.evaluate` function to obtain the final result.
