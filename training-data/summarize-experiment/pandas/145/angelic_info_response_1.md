Based on the source code and the expected return value for the given test case, here's a comprehensive analysis of the core logic of the function `dispatch_to_series`:

1. The function takes several input parameters including `left` (a DataFrame), `right` (which can be a scalar, DataFrame, or Series), `func` (an arithmetic or comparison operator), `str_rep` (a string or None), and `axis` (which can be None, 0, 1, "index", or "columns").

2. The function starts by importing the `expressions` module from `pandas.core.computation.expressions`.

3. It then modifies the value of `right` using the `lib.item_from_zerodim` function.

4. The function proceeds to check the type of `right` and based on its type and the value of `axis`, it assigns a specific function `column_op` to handle the operation for the given input parameters.

5. The `column_op` function is designed to operate column-wise on the DataFrame.

6. After defining the appropriate `column_op` function based on the type of `right`, the code then calls the `expressions.evaluate` function, passing in the `column_op` function, `str_rep`, `left`, and `right`.

7. Finally, the function returns the result of the evaluation as `new_data`.

In summary, the core logic of the `dispatch_to_series` function involves determining the type of `right` and the value of `axis` to assign the appropriate column operation function. It then evaluates the operation using the selected function and returns the result.
