It appears that the function `dispatch_to_series` takes in several input parameters, including `left`, `right`, `func`, `str_rep`, and `axis`. 

Based on the given expected return value and type for case 1, it can be inferred that the function checks the type of `right` and then dispatches to the appropriate implementation. It uses `iloc` to access columns for compatibility with cases having non-unique columns. 

When the type of `right` is checked and determined to be a scalar or a DataFrame, the `column_op` function is defined in such a way that it will perform the operation column-by-column. In this case, we have `right` as a Series and `axis` as `'columns'`. This is important information as the type of `right` and the value of `axis` help determine how the `column_op` will be implemented.

The expected variable values and types before the function returns show that `a` represents the `left` DataFrame, `b` represents the `right` Series, and the variable `column_op` is a function. The `iloc` and the expressions module are also referenced within the function.

In summary, the core logic of the function involves determining the type of `right` and then defining the `column_op` function based on the type of `right` and the value of `axis`. The `column_op` function is then used to evaluate the frame operation `func(left, right)` by performing the operation column-by-column.

This analysis provides insight into the behavior and logic of the function, specifically how it handles different types of input parameters to dispatch to the appropriate implementation and perform the operation.
