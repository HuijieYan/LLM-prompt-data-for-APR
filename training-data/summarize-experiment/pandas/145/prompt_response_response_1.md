Based on the analysis, the potential error location within the `dispatch_to_series` function lies in the block that checks for the type of `right` and the value of `axis`. Specifically, the `elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":` block seems to be handling the input parameters in a manner inconsistent with the actual type and values of `right` and `left`. This mismatch in logic could be the cause of the bug.

To fix this bug, the logic of handling the `right` parameter based on its type and the value of `axis` needs to be revised. It seems that the operation `df * ser` in the `test_td64_op_nat_casting` function may require a different handling based on the type of `right` as a Series and the value of `axis` being "columns".

Here's the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, (ABCDataFrame, ABCSeries)):
        if axis == "columns":
            if isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame) and not right._indexed_same(left):
                raise ValueError("Index of right DataFrame must match with left DataFrame when axis is set to 'columns'")
            if isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
                if not right.index.equals(left.columns):
                    raise ValueError("Index of right Series must match with columns of left DataFrame when axis is set to 'columns'")
                right = pd.DataFrame({0: right.values}, index=left.index)  # Convert Series to DataFrame with the same index as left
            column_op = lambda a, b: a.apply(func, b=b)

        elif axis == "index" or axis == 0 or axis == 1:
            if not right.index.equals(left.index):
                raise ValueError("Index of right Series or DataFrame must match with index of left DataFrame when axis is set to 'index'")
            if isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
                right = pd.DataFrame({0: right.values}, index=left.index)  # Convert Series to DataFrame with the same index as left
            column_op = lambda a, b: a.apply(func, axis=axis, b=b)

        else:
            raise ValueError("Invalid value for axis. Expected None, 0, 1, 'index', or 'columns'")

    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected code, handling of the `right` parameter is revised to cover scenarios where `right` can be a scalar, DataFrame, or Series. Depending on the value of `axis`, appropriate operations are performed to ensure correct handling of the input parameters. The code also includes validation checks to ensure compatibility of index and column values as required.

The proposed changes address the potential mismatch in logic that could be causing the bug and provide a more comprehensive and accurate handling of the input parameters. This corrected code should resolve the issue and prevent the TypeError mentioned in the initial analysis.
