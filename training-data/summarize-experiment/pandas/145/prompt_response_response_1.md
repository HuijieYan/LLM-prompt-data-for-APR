The error "TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'" in the test function `test_td64_op_nat_casting` suggests that there is an issue with the multiplication operator (*) when the DataFrame `df` is multiplied by the Series `ser` in the `dispatch_to_series` function.

Upon analyzing the problematic function, it seems that the issue might stem from the function's inability to handle the operation involving an array and 'NaTType' appropriately. The operation lacks proper handling for 'NaTType', leading to the TypeError.

To resolve this issue, the `dispatch_to_series` function should be updated to handle the specific case of `timedelta64(NaT)` when performing arithmetic operations. This would involve modifying the `column_op` function in particular to handle the 'NaTType' correctly.

The corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function is as follows:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            if isinstance(b, Timedelta) and b.isna():
                return {i: np.nan for i in range(len(a.columns))}
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected code:
1. We have updated the `column_op` function to check if the `right` parameter is an instance of `Timedelta` and if it is NA. If so, it returns a dictionary with NaN values for each column.
2. For the other cases, the `column_op` function remains the same as in the original function.

These updates will ensure that the `dispatch_to_series` function handles the specific case of `timedelta64(NaT)` correctly when performing arithmetic operations, resolving the TypeError issue.
