Based on the analysis, it seems that the bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function occurs due to the inconsistency in the path of execution based on the observed input and output values. The logic for operating row-by-row using the `right` Series seems to be inconsistent with the actual type and values of the `right` and `left` parameters, leading to the unsupported operand type error.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the path of execution within the `dispatch_to_series` function aligns with the actual type and values of the `right` and `left` parameters. This can be achieved by revising the conditional logic and the handling of the `right` parameter based on its type and the value of `axis`.

Here's the fixed version of the `dispatch_to_series` function with the bug resolved:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the fixed version of the function, the conditional logic has been revised to ensure that the correct path of execution is chosen based on the type and values of the `right` parameter. Additionally, the handling of the `right` parameter within each conditional block has been adjusted to align with the observed input and output values. This should resolve the unsupported operand type error and ensure that the function operates as intended.
