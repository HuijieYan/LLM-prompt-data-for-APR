Based on the test case and error message provided, it is evident that the issue is related to the multiplication operation between a DataFrame and a Series containing 'NaT' values of type 'timedelta64[ns]'. The error message suggests that the problem occurs when trying to perform the operation of multiplication between the DataFrame and the Series.

The error points to the `array_ops.py` file, implying that the issue lies within the arithmetic operations involving arrays, which leads back to the `dispatch_to_series` function. The function utilizes conditional branches to handle different types of input parameters, and the issue likely arises from the incorrect handling of 'NaT' values in the context of arithmetic operations.

As a potential solution, the conditional branches in the function need to be reviewed to ensure consistent and proper handling of 'NaT' values. Additionally, the behavior of the `expressions.evaluate` function in processing data, especially involving 'NaT' values, needs to be verified.

With these considerations in mind, the relevant code needs to be updated to better handle the arithmetic operations involving 'NaT' values. Below is the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function that addresses the issue:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        new_data = left.apply(func, right)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        new_data = left.apply(func, right)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        new_data = left.apply(func, right, axis=1)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later
        new_data = left.apply(func, right)
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    return new_data
```

In the corrected code:
1. The conditional branches have been updated to utilize the `apply` method for the DataFrame `left` to perform the operation with the `right` input, considering the type and context of the `right` parameter.
2. The use of `iloc` and the `expressions` module has been removed, and the `apply` method is used to perform the operation column-by-column or row-by-row based on the type and axis of the `right` parameter.

This revised code aims to properly handle arithmetic operations involving the 'NaT' values and improve the consistency of operation handling across different data types and axes.
