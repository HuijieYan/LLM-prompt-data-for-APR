The error "TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'" suggests that there is an issue with the multiplication operator (*) when the DataFrame `df` is multiplied by the Series `ser` in the `test_td64_op_nat_casting` function.

Upon reviewing the test function `test_td64_op_nat_casting`, it appears to test the dispatch_to_series method by performing an arithmetic operation (`*`) on the DataFrame `df` and the Series `ser`. The goal is to ensure that Pandas does not accidentally treat timedelta64(NaT) as datetime64 when calling `dispatch_to_series` in DataFrame arithmetic. The multiplication should involve element-wise multiplication between the DataFrame and the Series.

The specific lines causing the issue are:
```python
result = df * ser
```

Within the `dispatch_to_series` function, the evaluation of the operation occurs under the expressions' evaluate method, as seen from the error message:
```python
result = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
``` 

However, the error occurs when attempting to perform element-wise multiplication within the `na_arithmetic_op` method, causing a `TypeError`:
```python
result = expressions.evaluate(op, str_rep, left, right, **eval_kwargs)
```
```python
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'
```

To resolve this issue, it's crucial to address the inability to perform the element-wise operation involving an array and 'NaTType'. It's possible that the operation lacks proper handling for 'NaTType'.

The test function indicates that the issue specifically affects timedelta64(NaT) when calling `dispatch_to_series` in DataFrame arithmetic. Therefore, updating the `dispatch_to_series` method to handle this specific case may resolve the error. The changes in the method's handling of `timedelta64(NaT)` when performing arithmetic operations should facilitate the correct execution of the test function.
