In the `pandas/tests/frame/test_arithmetic.py` file, the `test_td64_op_nat_casting` function is contained and the corresponding error message is shown. The function is used to test the dispatch_to_series in DataFrame arithmetic by evaluating the frame operation `*` on na_array and array. Specifically:

- The `dispatch_to_series` function is being tested as a result of the operation `df * ser`, which occurs in the `test_td64_op_nat_casting` function.
- The `dispatch_to_series` function is expected to call the expressions.evaluate function with the column_op function, the string representation (str_rep), the left DataFrame (df), and the right Series (ser).
- The error occurs in the expressions.evaluate function on the line `result = expressions.evaluate(op, str_rep, left, right, **eval_kwargs)`, leading to a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'`.

The error message originates in the `pandas/core/ops/array_ops.py` file within the `na_arithmetic_op` function. Furthermore, the exception is being raised due to an unsupported operand type for the '*' operator, specifically between a NumPy ndarray and a NaTType. The error message also includes relevant information about the operands involved and their types.

The error trace implies that the `result = expressions.evaluate(op, str_rep, left, right, **eval_kwargs)` line in the `dispatch_to_series` function results in the error. Upon further propagation, the error occurs due to the `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'` at the `op(a, b)` line in the `pandas/core/computation/expressions.py` file under `_evaluate_standard` function. This suggests that the DataFrame multiplication operation (`*`) in the `dispatch_to_series` call is unsupported between a NumPy ndarray and a NaTType.

This error is generated from the unresolved multiplication of two operands, where one operand is a NumPy array (`array([1, 3])`) and the other is a NaT (Not-a-Time) value. Consequently, the DataFrame multiplication operation leads to a `TypeError`, as the framework does not support this operation between a NumPy array and a NaTType.

To further verify the root cause, it is essential to inspect the segments in the `dispatch_to_series` function where the operands are noted, as well as the `pandas/tests/frame/test_arithmetic.py` file to understand the exact parameters passed to the `dispatch_to_series` function.
