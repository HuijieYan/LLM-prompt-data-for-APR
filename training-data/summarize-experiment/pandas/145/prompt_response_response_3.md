The test function `test_td64_op_nat_casting` is attempting to perform a multiplication operation between a DataFrame `df` and a Series `ser`. The error message indicates that the issue arises from the attempt to perform multiplication between a NumPy array and a 'NaT' type, leading to a `TypeError` with the message `unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'`.

The bug is likely located within the implementation of the `dispatch_to_series` function. This function is responsible for evaluating the frame operation `func(left, right)` column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation. The issue occurs when handling the multiplication operation between the DataFrame and the Series, specifically in the context of dealing with NaN values (represented as 'NaT' in Pandas).

From the provided information, it seems that the function `dispatch_to_series` may not be correctly handling the NaN values when operating on the Series and the DataFrame. This could be due to an inconsistency in how NaN values are processed within the conditional branches of the function, leading to the `TypeError` during the multiplication operation.

To fix the bug, it is essential to review and revise the conditional branches within the `dispatch_to_series` function to ensure consistent handling of NaN values across all code paths. Additionally, the implementation of the `column_op` function and the use of `expressions.evaluate` need to be examined to ensure proper handling of NaN values during the column-wise operation.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function to address the NaN value handling issue:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Check if right is a scalar
    if lib.is_scalar(right):
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right))
    # Check if right is a DataFrame
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right[col.name]))
    # Check if right is a Series and axis is "columns"
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right))
    # Check if right is a Series
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right))
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, the conditional branches have been revised to handle the different types of `right` parameters and the specified axis. The `apply` function is used to apply the `func` operation to the columns of the DataFrame `left` based on the type and characteristics of `right`. This ensures consistent handling of NaN values and proper column-wise operations.
