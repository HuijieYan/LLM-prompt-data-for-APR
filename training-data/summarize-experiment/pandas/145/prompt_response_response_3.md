Based on the analysis, the bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function seems to stem from the inconsistency in the path of execution based on the observed input and output values. Specifically, the logic for operating row-by-row using the `right` Series appears to be inconsistent with the actual type and values of the `right` and `left` parameters. This could be the underlying issue that needs to be addressed in the code to fix the bug.

To address this bug, the function should be modified to correctly handle the column-wise operation based on the type of `right` and the value of `axis`. In the identified block where the error might be occurring, it is important to ensure that the logic for handling the operation matches the actual type and values of the `right` and `left` parameters, as well as the specified `axis`.

Here's the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function that resolves the bug:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions
    
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and (axis == "columns" or axis == 1): # Corrected the condition for column-wise operation
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc) for i in range(len(a.columns))} # Fixed the row-wise operation to column-wise
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected code, I modified the condition for column-wise operation to handle the case where `axis` is equal to "columns" or 1. Additionally, I adjusted the `column_op` function to correctly perform column-wise operations based on the input parameters. These modifications ensure that the function correctly handles the column-wise operation based on the type of `right` and the specified `axis`, addressing the inconsistency in the path of execution observed in the buggy version of the function.
