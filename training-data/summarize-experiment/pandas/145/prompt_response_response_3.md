The test case `test_td64_op_nat_casting` involves performing an element-wise multiplication using the DataFrame `df` and the Series `ser`. The purpose is to ensure that Pandas does not accidentally treat timedelta64(NaT) as datetime64 when calling `dispatch_to_series` in DataFrame arithmetic.

The error message "TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'" indicates that the bug occurs during the multiplication operation (*) when the DataFrame `df` is multiplied by the Series `ser`.

The bug is likely located within the `column_op` function, which is used to apply the `func` operation on elements from the input DataFrames and Series. Here, the bug specifically arises when handling timedelta64(NaT) values, which causes an unsupported operand type error during the multiplication operation.

The bug occurs because the `column_op` function does not handle the case of multiplication involving timedelta64(NaT) and a DataFrame correctly. The function needs to be updated to handle this specific case and ensure that proper operations are performed on timedelta64(NaT) values.

To fix the bug, the `column_op` function should be modified to handle the specific case of timedelta64(NaT) when performing arithmetic operations. This modification will ensure that the function correctly handles element-wise multiplication involving timedelta64(NaT) values.

Here's the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not isinstance(b, pd.Timedelta) else a.iloc[:, i].mul(b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected code, the `column_op` function now checks if the `b` parameter is an instance of `pd.Timedelta`, and if so, it performs element-wise multiplication using the `mul` method. This modification ensures that timedelta64(NaT) values are handled correctly during arithmetic operations, resolving the bug in the function.
