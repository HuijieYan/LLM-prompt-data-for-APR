Based on the test case `test_td64_op_nat_casting` and the error message "TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'", it is clear that the issue lies within the multiplication operation (*) when the DataFrame `df` is multiplied by the Series `ser` inside the `dispatch_to_series` function.

The bug occurs because the function does not properly handle the case where the `right` parameter is a Series with a value of `NaT` (Not a Time) type, causing a TypeError due to unsupported operand types for the multiplication operation.

To address this bug, the handling of `NaT` values within the `dispatch_to_series` function needs to be updated to ensure proper handling of timedelta64(NaT) and prevent unintended type conflicts during arithmetic operations. Specifically, the `column_op` function inside the conditional statements based on the type of `right` should be modified to handle operations involving `NaT` values.

A possible approach for fixing the bug is to add a check for `NaT` values in the `column_op` function and handle them appropriately based on the type of operation being performed (e.g., multiplication). This can involve leveraging Pandas' functionalities for handling missing values and special cases such as `NaT`.

Here is the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isna(b) else b for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) if not pd.isna(b.iloc[i]) else b.iloc[i] for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) if not pd.isna(b) else b for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected code, the `column_op` functions for different cases (scalar, DataFrame, and Series) include checks for NaN values using `pd.isna()` to handle `NaT` values appropriately based on the type of operation being performed. This ensures that the function can handle `NaT` values without causing TypeErrors during arithmetic operations.
