Based on the analysis of the test case and the error message, the bug likely occurs within the conditional branches of the `dispatch_to_series` function. The error message indicates that the issue arises during the operation involving a NumPy array and the 'NaT' type, suggesting an inconsistency in how the 'NaT' value is handled within the arithmetic operation.

The bug occurs due to the way the function handles the 'NaT' type in the context of arithmetic operations when operating column-wise. This inconsistency in handling 'NaT' values leads to the error when attempting the multiplication operation.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to ensure that the 'NaT' values are properly handled in the arithmetic operations within the conditional branches of the `dispatch_to_series` function. Additionally, the `expressions.evaluate` method should handle 'NaT' values appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right))  # Apply func to each column
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col, index: func(col, right[index]), axis=0)  # Apply func to each corresponding pair of columns
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col, index: func(col, right[index]), axis=0)  # Apply func to each pair of column and corresponding index in the Series
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right))  # Apply func to each column
    else:
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    return new_data
```

In the corrected code, the conditional branches are simplified and modified to handle the 'NaT' values appropriately. The `apply` method is used to apply the arithmetic operation `func` to each column or corresponding pair of columns based on the type of `right` and the value of `axis`.

This approach ensures consistent handling of 'NaT' values and performs the arithmetic operations column-wise as specified. Additionally, the use of `expressions.evaluate` is not necessary for this specific scenario, as the arithmetic operations are directly performed using the `apply` method.
