Based on the observed variables and expected return values, the bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is likely caused by the inconsistent path of execution based on the type and values of the `right` and `left` parameters. The code incorrectly goes into the block for row-wise operation when the `right` parameter is actually a Series with values meant for column-wise operation. This inconsistency leads to the bug and the subsequent error message.

To fix this bug, the condition checking for `elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":` should be updated to handle the column-wise operation appropriately.

The corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function is as follows:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Updated condition to handle column-wise operation

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected code, the condition `elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":` has been updated to check if `right.index.equals(left.index)` to correctly handle the column-wise operation when `right` is a Series and `axis` is set to "columns". This ensures that the correct path of execution is taken based on the type and values of the input parameters, resolving the bug in the function.
