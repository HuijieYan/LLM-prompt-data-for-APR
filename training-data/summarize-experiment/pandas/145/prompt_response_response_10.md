Based on the given test case and error message, it appears that the error is related to the handling of timedelta values in the arithmetic operation between a DataFrame and a Series. The error message indicates that the issue is with the multiplication operation between a NumPy array and the 'NaT' type.

The potential error location within the `dispatch_to_series` function might be in the conditional branches where the type of `right` is checked. Specifically, the handling of timedelta values and NaN values (like 'NaT') during the arithmetic operation could be causing the issue. Additionally, the use of `expressions.evaluate` to compute the new data may not be handling NaN values or timedelta values correctly.

The bug likely occurred because the function is not properly handling the timedelta values in the Series when operating column-wise, leading to the error during the arithmetic operation. Additionally, the behavior of the function within each branch and how it handles NaN values and timedelta values need to be reviewed.

To fix the bug, it is essential to ensure that the conditional branches within the function correctly handle the type of `right` and the value of `axis`, and that the behavior and handling of timedelta values and NaN values are consistent across all code paths. Additionally, it is necessary to verify how `expressions.evaluate` processes the data and whether it correctly handles NaN values and timedelta values in this context.

Here's the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:
```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    if axis not in [None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"]:
        raise ValueError("Invalid value for 'axis' parameter")

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    
    def column_op(a, b):
        return a.apply(lambda x: func(x, b))

    new_data = left.apply(column_op, b=right)
    return new_data
```
In the corrected code:
- We removed the conditional branches and simplified the function to directly use the `apply` method to operate column-wise. This removes the need for complex conditional logic based on the type of `right`.
- We removed the use of `expressions.evaluate` and instead used the `apply` method with a lambda function to apply the arithmetic operation column-wise.

This revised version of the function should resolve the issue by simplifying the logic and ensuring that the arithmetic operation is applied correctly column-wise.
