Based on the test case, error message, and variable analysis, it appears that the bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function is caused by the inappropriate path taken for the operation, as well as the inconsistent operation based on the type and values of the `right` and `left` parameters.

To address the bug:
1. We need to ensure that the operation path is chosen based on the actual type and values of the `right` parameter.
2. We should evaluate the input parameters to determine the appropriate type of operation for the given `right` and `left` values.
3. We should modify the conditional blocks to handle the operation more accurately based on the input types and values.

With these considerations in mind, here's the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import numpy as np
    from pandas.core.dtypes.generic import ABCDataFrame, ABCSeries
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        column_op = lambda a, b: {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        column_op = lambda a, b: {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and (axis == "columns" or right.index.equals(left.columns)):
        column_op = lambda a, b: {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and right.index.equals(left.index):
        column_op = lambda a, b: {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected function:
- The import statements are included at the beginning.
- The conditional blocks are modified to handle the operation more accurately based on the input types and values.
- The lambda functions are used to define the `column_op` functions based on the conditions.
- The appropriate conditions are also modified to handle the column-wise and row-wise operations based on the input parameters.

This corrected version addresses the bug by ensuring that the correct operation path is chosen based on the actual type and values of the `right` parameter. The conditional blocks are modified to handle the operation accurately based on the input types and values.

This revised function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.
