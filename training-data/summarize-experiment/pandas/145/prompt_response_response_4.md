The error "TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for *: 'numpy.ndarray' and 'NaTType'" in the test function `test_td64_op_nat_casting` suggests that the issue lies in the multiplication operation when the DataFrame `df` is multiplied by the Series `ser`. This error indicates that the function `dispatch_to_series` might not be handling the multiplication operation involving a timedelta64(NaT) and a DataFrame correctly.

The potential error location within the function is likely in the handling of the `timedelta64(NaT)` values when performing the arithmetic operation. It seems that the function may not have a specific case to handle the element-wise multiplication involving the `NaTType`, leading to the `TypeError` during evaluation.

To resolve this issue, the function `dispatch_to_series` needs to be updated to properly handle the element-wise arithmetic operations involving the `NaTType` in the Series `ser` and the DataFrame `df`. This would involve adding a specific case to handle the `timedelta64(NaT)` values when performing the multiplication operation.

The corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function is presented below:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        # We only get here if called via left._combine_match_columns,
        # in which case we specifically want to operate row-by-row
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)

        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)  # Handle other cases later

        if func.__name__ == 'mul' and np.issubdtype(right.dtype, np.timedelta64):
            # Handle element-wise multiplication involving NaT
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: a.iloc[:, i] if pd.isnull(b) else func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        else:
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected code, the handling for the `timedelta64(NaT)` values is added as a specific case within the conditional block for `ABCSeries`. This ensures that element-wise multiplication involving `NaT` values and the DataFrame is properly handled by checking for the 'mul' operation and the data type of the Series.

With these changes, the function should now handle the arithmetic operation involving timedelta64(NaT) and resolve the `TypeError` encountered during evaluation in the test function. This corrected code can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.
