Based on the analysis of the test case and the error message, it appears that the bug in the `dispatch_to_series` function arises from an inconsistent path of execution based on the observed input and output values. The logic for operating row-by-row using the `right` Series seems to be inconsistent with the actual type and values of the `right` and `left` parameters.

To fix this bug, the conditional statements that determine the type of `right` and select the appropriate `column_op` function based on the type and value of `axis` need to be carefully reviewed and revised.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return a.apply(lambda x: func(x, b))

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return a.apply(lambda x: func(x, b))

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis == "columns":
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return a.apply(lambda x: func(x, b))

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return a.apply(lambda x: func(x, b))

    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = left.apply(column_op, b=right)
    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, the `column_op` function is defined to use the `apply` method to apply the `func` to each column of the `left` DataFrame with the `right` parameter. This allows for consistent column-wise operations, as the original code had inconsistent handling of row-by-row and column-wise operations based on the input and output values. This revised version aims to address the bug and ensure consistent behavior for different types of `right` parameters and values.
