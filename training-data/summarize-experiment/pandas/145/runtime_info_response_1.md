From the logs, we can see that the input parameters for the buggy function `dispatch_to_series` are a DataFrame `left`, a Series `right`, an arithmetic operator function `func`, and some optional parameters `str_rep` and `axis`. The function is supposed to dispatch to the Series implementation and return a new DataFrame.

In the first buggy case, the `right` Series contains NaN values of type `timedelta64[ns]`. The `func` is the multiplication function. The `axis` parameter is set to `'columns'`, and the indices of `right` and `left` are a `RangeIndex`.

Before the function returns, we see that the `a` parameter is the same as the `left` DataFrame, and its `iloc` attribute is used to access columns. The `b` parameter is an array of the same NaN values as the input `right`. The `column_op` is a function that takes `a` and `b` as parameters and operates on them column-wise.

Looking at the code of the `dispatch_to_series` function, we can see that it contains multiple conditional branches based on the type and attributes of the `right` parameter. In this case, given that `right` is a Series with `axis` set to `'columns'`, the function should be using the conditional branch for `ABCDataFrame` and operating column-wise.

The issue may lie in the conditional checks and the behavior of the function within each branch. It's possible that the function is not properly handling the NaN values in the Series when operating column-wise. Additionally, the use of `expressions.evaluate` to compute the new data may not be handling NaN values correctly.

To fix this issue, we would need to review the conditional branches within the function and ensure that the behavior and handling of NaN values are consistent across all code paths. Additionally, we would need to verify how `expressions.evaluate` processes the data and whether it correctly handles NaN values in this context.
