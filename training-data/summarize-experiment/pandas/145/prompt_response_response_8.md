Based on the test case and the error message, it appears that the issue primarily arises from the use of the `axis == "columns"` condition in the `dispatch_to_series` function, which may not align with the actual type and values of the `right` and `left` parameters. 

The bug occurs when the code attempts to operate row-by-row using the `right` Series, while it should be operating column-wise based on the type and values of the input parameters. This inconsistency in the path of execution based on the observed input and output values is likely the cause of the bug.

To fix the bug, the logic for choosing the operation based on the type of `right` needs to be revisited. This involves ensuring that the correct column-wise operation is chosen based on the type and values of the input parameters, especially when dealing with a Series.

Additionally, it's important to ensure that the chosen operation aligns with the type and desired operation (row-wise or column-wise) of the `right` and `left` parameters.

Lastly, when outputting the revised function, it should include the changes made to address the bug and ensure that the corrected function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.

Below is the corrected code for the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    # Note: we use iloc to access columns for compat with cases
    #       with non-unique columns.
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        def column_op(a, b):
            return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[:, i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}

    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries):
        if axis == "columns":
            assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b.iloc[i]) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
        else:
            assert right.index.equals(left.index)
            def column_op(a, b):
                return {i: func(a.iloc[:, i], b) for i in range(len(a.columns))}
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    new_data = expressions.evaluate(column_op, str_rep, left, right)
    return new_data
```

In the revised function, the logic for choosing the appropriate operation based on the type of `right` and the `axis` parameter has been adjusted. This ensures that the correct operation is selected based on the type and values of the input parameters, addressing the inconsistency in the path of execution. The corrected function includes changes to handle the operation based on column-wise or row-wise requirements, validating the index equality between the `right` and `left` parameters.

This corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function should resolve the bug and can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
