Based on the provided information, the potential error location within the `dispatch_to_series` function is related to the handling of the 'NaT' value in the Series `right` when performing arithmetic operations with the DataFrame `left`. The error occurs during the multiplication operation between `df` and `ser`, as outlined in the test function `test_td64_op_nat_casting`. The error message indicates that the issue arises from attempting to perform multiplication between a NumPy array and the 'NaT' type.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the function properly handles the 'NaT' value in the Series and that the arithmetic operation involving the 'NaT' type is handled correctly. Additionally, the behavior of `expressions.evaluate` in processing the data and NaN values should be reviewed to ensure proper handling.

Here is the corrected version of the `dispatch_to_series` function:

```python
def dispatch_to_series(left, right, func, str_rep=None, axis=None):
    """
    Evaluate the frame operation func(left, right) by evaluating
    column-by-column, dispatching to the Series implementation.

    Parameters
    ----------
    left : DataFrame
    right : scalar or DataFrame
    func : arithmetic or comparison operator
    str_rep : str or None, default None
    axis : {None, 0, 1, "index", "columns"}

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame
    """
    import pandas.core.computation.expressions as expressions

    right = lib.item_from_zerodim(right)
    if lib.is_scalar(right) or np.ndim(right) == 0:
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col: func(col, right))
    elif isinstance(right, ABCDataFrame):
        assert right._indexed_same(left)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda col, idx: func(col, right[col.name]), axis=1)
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis in [None, 1, "index"]:
        assert right.index.equals(left.index)
        new_data = left.apply(func, axis=1, args=(right,))
    elif isinstance(right, ABCSeries) and axis in [0, "columns"]:
        assert right.index.equals(left.columns)
        new_data = left.apply(lambda row: func(row, right), axis=1)
    else:
        # Remaining cases have less-obvious dispatch rules
        raise NotImplementedError(right)

    return new_data
```

In the corrected version, the function now uses the `apply` method to perform the arithmetic operation based on the type of `right` and the value of `axis`. This approach ensures that the 'NaT' value in the Series is handled correctly during the arithmetic operations with the DataFrame. Additionally, the usage of `apply` provides a more concise and functional approach to performing the column-wise or row-wise operations based on the type of `right` and the `axis` value.
