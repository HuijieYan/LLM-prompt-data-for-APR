Looking at the input parameters for the buggy function in each case, we can observe that the `columns` parameter contains a tuple of values, which indicates that it is being used for both the row and column index. The `aggfunc` parameter is set to 'mean', the `fill_value` parameter is None, `margins` is set to False, `margins_name` is set to 'All', `dropna` is set to True, and `observed` is set to False.

In each buggy case, we are dealing with a DataFrame `data`, and we also observe the value of the `values` parameter, which indicates the column to be aggregated.

The key variable that is manipulated in the code includes `keys`, `values_passed`, `values_multi`, `to_filter`, `grouped`, `agged`, `table`, and others, which are computed based on the input parameters and the DataFrame `data`.

In all buggy cases, the function seems to be operating correctly up until the final return statement, where the resulting `table` does not match the expected output. This likely stems from a misinterpretation of the `columns` and `values` for the `.groupby()` and `.agg()` operations, and the subsequent operations implemented on the resulting data.

Upon careful examination, it would be beneficial to focus on the `.groupby()` and `.agg()` process to understand how the `table` is generated and whether any of these input parameters are being handled incorrectly within the processing of the DataFrame. Additionally, it could be important to check the dimensions and matching of the DataFrame to ensure that correct calculations are being made.
