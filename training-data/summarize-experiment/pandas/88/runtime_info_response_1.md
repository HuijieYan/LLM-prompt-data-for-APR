The function pivot_table is used to create a spreadsheet-style pivot table as a DataFrame. There are four buggy cases observed in the function which we will analyze one by one.

### Buggy Case 1:
- The input parameter columns have a tuple value of (1, 2) and aggfunc has a value of 'mean'.
- The data DataFrame contains three columns labeled 1, 2, and v, as displayed.

#### Before the function return:
- The columns are transformed to a list [1, 2] and keys contains the same list.
- The value is transformed to a list ['v'] and values_passed becomes True.
- The grouped object is generated by the groupby operation on the data.
- The agged DataFrame contains a calculated average value in the 'v' column for different index permutations.
- The table DataFrame contains the agged values.
- Since the table index.nlevels is 1, table remains unchanged. The then block that follows it is ignored.
  
From this analysis, it seems that the code correctly transformed input parameters columns and keys into lists but the issue might be with the subsequent operations on the dataframes such as grouped, agged, and table. It's hard to deduce the exact cause of the bug as everything seems to behave as expected given the input data.

### Buggy Case 2:
- Similar to Case 1, but columns now has a tuple value of ('a', 'b').
  
The result is expected to be the pivoted table like the one in Case 1. Since the bug in Case 1 still isn't obvious, the same considerations will apply here as well.

### Buggy Case 3:
- For this case, the columns value is (1, 'b'), similar to the pattern observed in the previous examples
- The agged DataFrame contains a calculated average value in the 'v' column for different index permutations.
    
The behavior seems similar to Case 1 with the difference in the column labels. The issue seems to persist in the subsequent operations on the dataframes and not with the input data.

### Buggy Case 4:
- The columns value is ('a', 1), again similar to the previous patterns. 
- The agged DataFrame contains a calculated average value in the 'v' column for different index permutations.

Similar to the first three cases, the operations on dataframes such as grouped, agged, and table might be causing the issue.

In conclusion, the bug in the pivot_table function might be due to the operations on the dataframes rather than the input data itself. A detailed examination of the behavior within these dataframe operations and their interactions with the input data is necessary to identify the root cause of the issue.
