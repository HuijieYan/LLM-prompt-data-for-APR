The issue in the `pivot_table` function seems to stem from the operations on the DataFrame objects, particularly in the cases involving multi-index column values. The bug might be caused by the internal DataFrame operations, such as grouping, aggregating, and unstacking, which are impacting the resulting DataFrame structure.

The error message indicates that the `pivot_table` function is treating the DataFrame as a Series in certain cases, which may be related to the processing of multi-index columns.

To fix the bug, it is crucial to carefully examine the behavior of the DataFrame operations within the `pivot_table` function, especially when dealing with multi-index columns.

One possible approach for addressing the bug would be to ensure that the internal DataFrame operations are correctly handling multi-index columns. This might involve verifying the behavior of groupby, agg, unstack, and other relevant operations to ensure that the resulting DataFrame structure is consistent.

Another approach could be to add specific checks and conditionals within the function to handle multi-index columns appropriately, ensuring that the operations on the DataFrame are compatible with the given input.

Here is the corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data: DataFrame,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False
) -> DataFrame:
    # Add condition to handle multi-index columns appropriately
    if isinstance(columns, (list, tuple)) and len(columns) > 1:
        table = data.pivot_table(values=values, index=index, columns=list(columns), aggfunc=aggfunc, fill_value=fill_value,
                                 margins=margins, dropna=dropna, margins_name=margins_name, observed=observed)
    else:
        table = data.pivot_table(values=values, index=index, columns=columns, aggfunc=aggfunc, fill_value=fill_value,
                                 margins=margins, dropna=dropna, margins_name=margins_name, observed=observed)

    return table
```

In this revised version of the function, a conditional is added to handle scenarios where the `columns` parameter contains multi-index column values. If the `columns` parameter contains multiple values, it is converted into a list before calling the `pivot_table` function. This addition ensures that multi-index columns are properly handled within the function.
