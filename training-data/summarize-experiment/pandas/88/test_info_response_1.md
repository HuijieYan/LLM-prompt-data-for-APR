Upon analyzing the provided code and the error message, it becomes apparent that the issue is stemming from the `test_pivot_table_multiindex_only` function in the `test_pivot.py` file. The specific line of code that is causing the error is this one: `result = df2.pivot_table(values="v", columns=cols)`. The error message indicates that an AttributeError is being raised: "`AttributeError: 'Series' object has no attribute 'columns'`".

This is a critical piece of information because it points us toward the root cause of the problem. The `pivot_table` function is being called on the `df2` DataFrame, and this error indicates that the DataFrame it is being called on is being treated as a Series. This may be due to an issue with the way the `cols` parameter is structured or passed into the `pivot_table` function.

Looking back at the `test_pivot_table_multiindex_only` function code, it can be observed that the `cols` parameter is being generated through a `@pytest.mark.parametrize` decorator, which takes care of providing multiple values for the `cols` parameter. However, a thorough examination of the `cols` parameter is necessary in order to identify the issue.

In the test functions, the `cols` parameter is being generated from the following list of tuples: `[(1, 2), ("a", "b"), (1, "b"), ("a", 1)]`. Since the different pairs of values in these tuples may be contributing to the error, it is necessary to inspect how exactly the `cols` parameter values are handled within the `pivot_table` call in the `test_pivot.py` file.

According to the error message, it seems that the `cols` parameter is being interpreted as a `Series` object rather than a `DataFrame`, which is likely causing the `pivot_table` function to fail. Moreover, in the error message, there is a line of code that creates a MultiIndex Series: 
```
self =    a  1
v  1  1    4
   2  2    5
   3  3    6
dtype: int64
name = 'columns'
```
This signifies that the `cols` parameter is being used to create a MultiIndex Series, which might be the source of the error. 

In conclusion, the issue is most probably caused by the format or content of the `cols` parameter being passed to the `pivot_table` function, which results in this parameter being interpreted as a `Series` rather than a `DataFrame`. Therefore, it is crucial to closely examine how the `cols` parameter is constructed and passed to the `pivot_table` function in the `test_pivot.py` file in order to resolve the error.
