The buggy function in question here is `pivot_table` from the pandas package. The purpose of this test is to ensure that when we create a pivot table with multi-index columns only, the function returns expected results. 

In this test, we have a data frame `df2` consisting of three columns: `cols[0]`, `cols[1]`, and 'v', with the values as specified. The pivot table function is invoked on this data frame with "v" as the `values` parameter and `columns` attribute as `cols`. The `cols` are provided as tuples and the `DataFrame` is created accordingly. 

However, when the pivot table function is invoked, an error is raised in the pandas package indicating that 'Series' object has no attribute 'columns'. After completing the execution of the function, an AttributeError is raised from the `__getattr__` method located in the `generic.py` file.

The error indicates that the 'Series' object, which is inside the 'pivot_table' function has no attribute of 'columns', and this exception is being raised when the function attempts to access 'columns' attribute on that object.

Based on this information, it seems that the issue is within the 'pivot_table' function, where it inadvertently manipulates the input data in a manner that results in 'Series' objects instead of 'DataFrame' objects, leading to a failure when the function tries to access 'columns' attribute.

To diagnose and resolve this issue, detailed inspection of the `pivot_table` function is necessary, specifically focusing on the section of the code where the 'Series' object is introduced and used while trying to access the 'columns' attribute of that object. It implies that the function is not correctly handling the input data in some cases and is returning a 'Series' object where it should return a 'DataFrame' object. Additionally, reviewing the implementation of data manipulation and column handling would be pivotal in resolving this problem. Erroneous lines of code, especially the ones involving data manipulation and assignment to the table variable, need to be identified and fixed. Furthermore, the specific context in which the 'pivot_table' function is receiving input data would also be crucial to comprehend, as it can assist in determining whether the issue is related to the function's input handling or the table creation process itself.

A detailed analysis of the 'pivot_table' function with a focus on the aforementioned aspects is necessary to identify the root cause of the problem and to implement a fix that resolves the error. Additionally, a review of the function's interaction with input data would be advantageous in understanding the issue's origin and crafting an appropriate resolution.
