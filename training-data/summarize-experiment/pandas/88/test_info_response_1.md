The error message provided indicates that the failing test is `test_pivot_table_multiindex_only` from the file `test_pivot.py`:

```python
def test_pivot_table_multiindex_only(self, cols):
    # GH 17038
    df2 = DataFrame({cols[0]: [1, 2, 3], cols[1]: [1, 2, 3], "v": [4, 5, 6]})

    result = df2.pivot_table(values="v", columns=cols)
```

The error occurs within the `pivot_table` function as a result of an attribute error. The error stack trace points to the line in the `pivot_table` function where the `object.__getattribute__` method is called.

This indicates that the failing test, when calling `df2.pivot_table(values="v", columns=cols)`, is expecting the method `pivot_table` to return a `Series` object with a `columns` attribute. However, an `AttributeError` is raised when trying to access the `columns` attribute on the returned `Series` object.

This points to a potential issue within the `pivot_table` function itself, rather than the test implementation. Therefore, we need to focus on the particular code segments of the `pivot_table` function that might affect the return type and attributes of the output.

- Given that the `df2.pivot_table(values="v", columns=cols)` call within the failing test is expected to return a `Series` object, the relevant parts of the `pivot_table` function that influence its return type should be carefully reviewed.
- The error message indicates an `AttributeError` when trying to access the `columns` attribute on the returned `Series` object. This implies that the return type of the `pivot_table` function might not be what is expected by the test assertion.

By meticulously analyzing and debugging the `pivot_table` function, we can identify the root cause of the AttributeError and make modifications to address the issue.
