From the error message, it is evident that the error is specifically related to casting from float64 to int64. This is due to the fact that the DataFrame or Series, containing `float64` values, is not safely cast to a `int64`. The safe_cast function throws an error due to this type casting issue.

The root cause of the error indicated in the error message originates from an attempt to perform a type cast from `float64` to `int64`. These values are part of a DataFrame or Series produced by performing the calculation of 'variance' on a groupby object in the test code. This particular aggregation involves creating groups based on a certain criterion and then calculating the variance for each group. The resultant values are then in `float64` format, and there's an attempt to cast these into `int64` in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function from the original code, causing the error.

To resolve the issue, the type casting needs to be corrected in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function so that it does not attempt to cast `float64` to `int64`. This would involve further updating the `type(block.values)._from_sequence` call in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. A potential resolution could be to update this function to handle `float64` values appropriately and avoid casting to `int64`, or handle these data types specifically.

By identifying the error message and connecting it with the relevant sections of the original code, the error in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function for type casting can sufficiently be diagnosed and resolved. This will involve handling the type casting operations to avoid any conflicts that might be present. Additionally, unit tests that specifically capture these type casting scenarios might be helpful to validate that the fix is comprehensive.
