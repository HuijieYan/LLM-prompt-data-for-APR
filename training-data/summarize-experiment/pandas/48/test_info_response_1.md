The error message is indicating that the test is trying to cast a datatype from float to int64 by using the `astype` method and running it through the `safe_cast` method. However, the `astype` casting is failing as it encounters a `TypeError: Cannot cast array from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') according to the rule 'safe'`.

Additionally, the error message also gives information on the index and the type of error raised: `values = array([0.5, 0.5, 0.5]), dtype = <class 'numpy.int64'>, copy = False, pandas/core/arrays/integer.py:156: TypeError`.

From the test function code, it is evident that the tested functions are focused on the behavior of nullable integer returns when applying functions such as 'mean', 'median', and 'var'. It is likely that the test function is running into an issue due to the presence of `pd.NA` in the input data.

Furthermore, the test function appears to be running assertions to check whether the output is as expected by using the `tm.assert_frame_equal(result, expected)` method.

In the function `_cython_agg_blocks`, it is trying to cast values to a certain data type. The error seems to have occurred during this cast due to encountering mixed dtype or presence of `pd.NA` values.

In conclusion, the error is primarily due to the presence of `pd.NA` values in the input data, and subsequent attempts to cast the data to a different datatype. The `safe_cast` method could be altered to handle this more gracefully or the handling of `pd.NA` values in the input data needs to be reviewed.
