From the error messages, it is clear that the issue is related to the `TypeError: Cannot cast array from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') according to the rule 'safe'` occurring in the `integer.py 156` file. 

Looking at the test being executed in the test apply to nullable integer returns float in the `test_function.py` file, it is observed that the test involves applying `mean`, `median`, and `var` functions to groups obtained from a dataframe with nullable integer data. 

The line `result = getattr(groups, function)()` in the test function calls different group functions, including mean, median, and var.

Given the error and the code snippet, it appears that the issue is related to casting between float values and integer values. The error message shows that there is a "TypeError" related to casting values from float to int.

Looking at the function `_cython_agg_blocks` in the buggy function, it becomes clear that the error occurs when the function tries to cast the values to a different data type to perform aggregation. Specifically, the operation of casting float64 to int64 encounters an error in safe_cast.

The problematic line inside `_cython_agg_blocks` is:  
```python
values = safe_cast(values, dtype, copy=False)
```
It employs the `safe_cast` function that aims to ensure the values are safely cast to the specified dtype. However, the error message shows that casting from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') "according to the rule 'safe'" raises a TypeError.

Based on the test and the error messages, the problem seems to be related to attempting to cast float values to integer, especially when performing certain types of aggregations. The test cases involve nullable integer values, and it is likely that the logic within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is encountering issues due to the presence of nullable integer data.

To resolve the issue, it is necessary to review and potentially modify the logic in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, ensuring that it can handle the specific data types appropriately, particularly when dealing with nullable integer values. Further investigation and adjustments are required in the casting process and the operations related to handling the data types and aggregations within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.
