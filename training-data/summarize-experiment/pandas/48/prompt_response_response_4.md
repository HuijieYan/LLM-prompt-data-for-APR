Based on the error message and the given test cases, it is apparent that the error is related to casting from float64 to int64. The DataFrame or Series containing float64 values is not being safely cast to int64. This issue arises during the type casting process, and the safe_cast function throws an error due to this type casting problem.

Upon analyzing the buggy function, specifically the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, it is evident that there are portions of the code where type casting from float64 to int64 is attempted using the `_from_sequence` method on the block values. This type casting is causing issues, leading to the reported error.

To address this bug, the type casting operation needs to be handled more effectively in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. This may involve revisiting the logic surrounding the type casting process and ensuring that appropriate handling is in place when dealing with float64 and int64 data types. Additionally, considering specific scenarios where float64 to int64 casting is encountered and implementing appropriate handling for those cases would be essential.

Given the analysis, the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is provided below. This revised version addresses the type casting issue and ensures more robust handling of float64 and int64 data types.

In this corrected version, the type casting operations have been updated to handle float64 and int64 data types more effectively, avoiding conflicts that might have been present in the original function. The provided correction aims to address the type casting issue in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, resolving the bug related to type casting from float64 to int64.
