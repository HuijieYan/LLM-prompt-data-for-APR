The issue at hand is related to a TypeError occurring when calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with nullable integer dtype. This problem arises from the aggregation process within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, where data manipulation and cast operations are performed. The specific operation of casting float64 to int64 encounters an error in the "safe" casting process.

To address this bug, we need to ensure that the casting process specifically handles the conversion from float to int correctly, especially when dealing with nullable integer values. Additionally, the aggregation logic needs to be adjusted to handle nullable integer data appropriately.

Given the nature of the bug, it is crucial to carefully review and modify the casting process, ensuring that it can handle the specific data types, especially nullable integers, and the related aggregations.

Here's the revised version of the function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data._convert(datetime=False, numeric_only=numeric_only, copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []
    no_result = object()
    
    block_mask = np.zeros(data.shape[0], dtype=bool)
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        
        if block.is_datetime_or_timedelta:
            errmsg = (
                "cannot perform {how} with this "
                "method for blocks of dtype dtype:timedelta64"
            )
            raise DataError(errmsg)
        
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array

        # Cast the block values to float if they are of integer type
        if block.dtype in ['Int8', 'Int16', 'Int32', 'Int64']:
            block = block.astype('float64')

        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # generally if we have numeric_only=False
            # and non-applicable functions
            # try to python agg
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            
            # Handle aggregation with an alternate function
            result = self._aggregate_multiple_blocks(block, alt, axis)
        
        if isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            result_blocks = result._data.blocks
            if len(result_blocks) != 1:
                split_items.append(locs)
                split_frames.append(result)
                continue
            result = result_blocks[0].values

        # Handling for nullable integer type
        result = maybe_convert_objects(result, block, copy=False)
        
        agg_block: Block = make_block(result, locs, block.items)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
        new_items.append(agg_block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        block_mask[agg_block.mgr_locs.as_array] = True

    # Handling of deleted items and split frames
    deleted_items = [idx for idx in range(data.shape[0]) if not block_mask[idx]]
    if deleted_items:
        agg_blocks, new_items = self._cleanup_deleted(data, agg_blocks, new_items, split_items, split_frames, deleted_items)
        
    return agg_blocks, data.items.take(np.concatenate(new_items))
```

In the revised version of the function `_cython_agg_blocks`, we have made the following changes:
1. Added a check to convert integer data types to float64 to address the casting issue.
2. Introduced specific handling for nullable integer data using `maybe_convert_objects`.
3. Adjusted the logic for split frames handling to ensure correct aggregation.

These changes aim to address the bug related to casting from float64 to int64 and to handle aggregates appropriately, especially with nullable integer values. The revised function should provide a fix for the reported TypeError.
