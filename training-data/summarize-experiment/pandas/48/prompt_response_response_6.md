Based on the provided information, the bug seems to be related to handling nullable integer values, specifically when performing aggregation operations such as mean, median, and var. The error occurs due to the presence of pd.NA values and the attempt to cast the data to a different data type.

Potential Error Location:
The error likely occurs when trying to cast values to a specific data type in the _cython_agg_blocks function, particularly when encountering mixed data types or pd.NA values.

Reasons behind the Bug:
1. Presence of pd.NA values in the input data.
2. Attempt to cast the data to a different data type, leading to a TypeError.
3. Inconsistency in the behavior of aggregation operations with the nullable integer data type 'Int64'.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the casting mechanism to handle pd.NA values more gracefully.
2. Adjust the behavior of aggregation operations when encountering nullable integer data types.
3. Ensure consistent functionality across different data types.

Here's the corrected code for the _cython_agg_blocks function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    # Some object-dtype blocks might be split into List[Block[T], Block[U]]
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # generally if we have numeric_only=False
            # and non-applicable functions
            # try to python agg

            if alt is None:
                # we cannot perform the operation
                # in an alternate way, exclude the block
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            # handle pd.NA values and mixed data types here
            result = block.values._reduce(how, axis=self.axis, skipna=True, numeric_only=numeric_only, skipna_fill_value=None)
            result = cast(DataFrame, result)

        assert not isinstance(result, DataFrame)

        if result is not no_result:
            # see if we can cast the block back to the original dtype
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)

            if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                # e.g. block.values was an IntegerArray
                # (1, N) case can occur if block.values was Categorical
                #  and result is ndarray[object]
                assert result.ndim == 1 or result.shape[0] == 1
                try:
                    # Cast back if feasible
                    result = type(block.values)._from_sequence(
                        result.ravel(), dtype=block.values.dtype
                    )
                except ValueError:
                    # reshape to be valid for non-Extension Block
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # handle split blocks
    if split_items:
        for locs, result in zip(split_items, split_frames):
            assert len(locs) == result.shape[1]
            for i, loc in enumerate(locs):
                new_items.append(np.array([loc], dtype=locs.dtype))
                agg_blocks.append(result.iloc[:, [i]]._data.blocks[0])

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our
    # current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected function, the handling of pd.NA values and mixed data types is modified to ensure that aggregation operations with nullable integer 'Int64' data types are handled more gracefully. Additionally, the behavior when encountering split blocks is adjusted.

This corrected code aims to address the bug by ensuring consistent functionality and proper handling of nullable integer values during aggregation operations.
