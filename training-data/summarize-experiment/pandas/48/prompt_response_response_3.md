The error is related to calling the `mean` method on a DataFrameGroupBy object with dtype='Int64', which results in a TypeError. The expected behavior should be to calculate the mean of each group and return it as a DataFrame with the same dtype.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the `_cython_agg_blocks` method, where the aggregation operation is performed.

The bug is occurring mainly because the function is attempting to cast `float64` values to `int64` which results in a TypeError due to the incompatible data types. This type casting issue is triggered when the mean function is called on a DataFrameGroupBy with dtype='Int64'.

To fix the bug, the type casting operations need to be handled appropriately within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, specifically in the part that deals with type conversions and handling different data block types. The function should handle `float64` and `int64` data types separately to avoid any conflicts that might be present during aggregation operations.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
# Corrected and revised version of the function

def _cython_agg_blocks(self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1) -> Tuple[List[Block], Index]:
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.select_dtypes(include=['number'])  # Filter only numeric data

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array

        if block.is_numeric:  # Check if block is numeric
            result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count)
        else:  # Handle non-numeric blocks separately
            result = block.values
            split_items.append(locs)
            split_frames.append(DataFrame(data=block.values, index=data.items[locs]))

        if result is not no_result:
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Handling split blocks
    for locs, result in zip(split_items, split_frames):
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(result)

    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This revised version of the function handles non-numeric blocks separately, avoids unnecessary type casting, and addresses the root cause of the issue related to type conversion during aggregation operations.
