## Test Case Summary
From the error messages, it is clear that the issue is related to the `TypeError: Cannot cast array from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') according to the rule 'safe'` occurring in the `integer.py 156` file. 

Looking at the test being executed in the test apply to nullable integer returns float in the `test_function.py` file, it is observed that the test involves applying `mean`, `median`, and `var` functions to groups obtained from a dataframe with nullable integer data. 

The line `result = getattr(groups, function)()` in the test function calls different group functions, including mean, median, and var.

Given the error and the code snippet, it appears that the issue is related to casting between float values and integer values. The error message shows that there is a "TypeError" related to casting values from float to int.

Looking at the function `_cython_agg_blocks` in the buggy function, it becomes clear that the error occurs when the function tries to cast the values to a different data type to perform aggregation. Specifically, the operation of casting float64 to int64 encounters an error in safe_cast.

The problematic line inside `_cython_agg_blocks` is:  
```python
values = safe_cast(values, dtype, copy=False)
```
It employs the `safe_cast` function that aims to ensure the values are safely cast to the specified dtype. However, the error message shows that casting from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') "according to the rule 'safe'" raises a TypeError.

Based on the test and the error messages, the problem seems to be related to attempting to cast float values to integer, especially when performing certain types of aggregations. The test cases involve nullable integer values, and it is likely that the logic within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is encountering issues due to the presence of nullable integer data.

To resolve the issue, it is necessary to review and potentially modify the logic in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, ensuring that it can handle the specific data types appropriately, particularly when dealing with nullable integer values. Further investigation and adjustments are required in the casting process and the operations related to handling the data types and aggregations within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.



## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

Based on the provided buggy function code and the variable logs for each buggy case, we can establish a detailed narrative for each case and identify the specific part of the code that causes the bug.

Analysis of the buggy function code combined with the provided variable logs reveals the following insights for each case:

1. The function `_cython_agg_blocks` seems to be managing and manipulating data blocks.
2. The `data` variable is fetched from `_get_data_to_aggregate` and then possibly filtered using `get_numeric_data`.
3. A loop iterates over the `blocks` within `data`, updating and aggregating values based on certain conditions and operations. Information from the logs provides details about the data types and values at various points within the loop.
4. Based on the logs, it seems that the function is intended to return lists of aggregated data blocks and corresponding index items.

Through the analysis of the logs, it becomes apparent that the function encounters issues in the process of aggregation, potentially due to inaccurate result values and data manipulation.

Further investigation would involve examining the specific blocks of the function that correspond to the outliers in the variable logs, which would allow us to identify the root cause of the bugs and potential fixes.



# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype results in TypeError
```

## The associated detailed issue description
```text
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({
    'a' : [0,0,1,1,2,2,3,3],
    'b' : [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
},
dtype='Int64')

df.groupby('a').mean()

Problem description
Using the new nullable integer data type, calling mean after grouping results in a TypeError. Using int64 dtype it works:
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({
    'a' : [0,0,1,1,2,2,3,3],
    'b' : [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
},
dtype='int64')

print(df.groupby('a').mean())

as does keeping Int64 dtype but taking a single column to give a SeriesGroupBy:
import pandas as pd

df = pd.DataFrame({
    'a' : [0,0,1,1,2,2,3,3],
    'b' : [1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8]
},
dtype='Int64')

print(df.groupby('a')['b'].mean())

The error does not occur when calling min, max or first, but does also occur with median and std.
Expected Output
     b
a     
0  1.5
1  3.5
2  5.5
3  7.5
