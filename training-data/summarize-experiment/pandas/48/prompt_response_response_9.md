Based on the information provided, it's evident that the error is related to casting values from float to int, particularly when performing aggregations on nullable integer data. The `TypeError: Cannot cast array from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') according to the rule 'safe'` indicates the issue.

To address this bug, the logic within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function needs to be adjusted to handle the casting of float values to integer more effectively, especially when dealing with nullable integer data.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the logic for casting within the function and ensure that it can handle nullable integer data types appropriately during aggregations.

Additionally, it may be helpful to review the aggregation process to confirm that the appropriate data type conversions are applied.

Here's the revised version of the function `_cython_agg_blocks` that addresses the bug:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    # Some object-dtype blocks might be split into List[Block[T], Block[U]]
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        # Avoid inheriting result from earlier in the loop
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # generally if we have numeric_only=False
            # and non-applicable functions
            # try to python agg

            if alt is None:
                # we cannot perform the operation
                # in an alternate way, exclude the block
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            # call our grouper again with only this block
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                # Avoid call to self.values that can occur in DataFrame
                #  reductions; see GH#28949
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                # we may have an exception in trying to aggregate
                # continue and exclude the block
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            else:
                result = cast(DataFrame, result)
                # unwrap DataFrame to get array
                if len(result._data.blocks) != 1:
                    # We've split an object block! Everything we've assumed
                    # about a single block input returning a single block output
                    # is a lie. To keep the code-path for the typical non-split case
                    # clean, we choose to clean up this mess later on.
                    split_items.append(locs)
                    split_frames.append(result)
                    continue

                assert len(result._data.blocks) == 1
                result = result._data.blocks[0].values
                if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)

        assert not isinstance(result, DataFrame)

        if result is not no_result:
            if block.dtype.name == 'Int64' and 'float' in result.dtype.name:
                # Handle casting from float to int for nullable integer data
                # NOTE: Adjust this logic based on the specific requirements and behavior of nullable integer data type
                result = result.round().astype('Int64')

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    if split_items:
        # Clean up the mess left over from split blocks.
        for locs, result in zip(split_items, split_frames):
            assert len(locs) == result.shape[1]
            for i, loc in enumerate(locs):
                new_items.append(np.array([loc], dtype=locs.dtype))
                agg_blocks.append(result.iloc[:, [i]]._data.blocks[0])

    # reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our
    # current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        # we need to adjust the indexer to account for the
        # items we have removed
        # really should be done in internals :<
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the revised version of the function, I added a condition to handle the casting from float to int specifically for nullable integer data. This adjustment is meant to address the casting issue related to nullable integer data types. Itâ€™s important to note that the logic for handling nullable integer data may need further adjustments based on the specific requirements and behavior of nullable integer data type.
