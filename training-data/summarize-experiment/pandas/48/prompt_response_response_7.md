Based on the provided test case and the error message, it is apparent that the bug is related to casting between float values and integer values. The error message specifically mentions a "TypeError: Cannot cast array from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') according to the rule 'safe'". This indicates a problem with casting float values to integer, which aligns with the nature of the test case involving nullable integer data and the use of functions like mean, median, and var. 

The function `_cython_agg_blocks` attempts to cast values to a different data type for aggregation, and the error occurs during this casting process. The core issue seems to be related to handling nullable integer data types in the context of aggregation operations, causing conflicts when attempting to cast between float and integer values.

To fix this bug, adjustments need to be made to the logic within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to ensure proper handling of nullable integer data types during aggregation operations and type casting processes. Specific test cases involving nullable integer values should be considered to accommodate these scenarios.

Here's the revised version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function that resolves the issue:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # TODO: the actual managing of mgr_locs is a PITA
    # here, it should happen via BlockManager.combine

    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    no_result = object()

    for block in data.blocks:
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        result = no_result
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            try:
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
            except TypeError:
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue
            else:
                result = result.astype(block.dtype, copy=False)

        if result is not no_result:
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
            new_items.append(locs)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No types to aggregate")

    # considering removed items
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this revised version of the function, the logic for handling the casting of aggregated results has been adjusted to ensure proper handling of nullable integer data types. The casting process now explicitly uses the `astype` method with the original block's dtype, ensuring that the appropriate data type conversions are performed.

By addressing the specific type casting issues and considering scenarios involving nullable integer values, this revised function resolves the bug encountered during aggregation operations involving nullable integer data.
