Based on the provided test function and error message, the issue seems to be related to calling `mean` on a DataFrameGroupBy with a dtype of `Int64`, resulting in a TypeError. The error message indicates a problem with type casting from float64 to int64, which is likely occurring within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.

The reason for the bug is that the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is attempting to cast float64 values to int64, which is not allowed due to the nullable integer data type present in the DataFrame.

To address this issue, we need to handle the type casting more appropriately in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. Specifically, we should ensure that we handle nullable integer data types correctly when performing aggregation operations.

Here's the revised version of the function that resolves the type casting issue:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(block, how, axis=self.axis, min_count=min_count)
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(agg_block.mgr_locs.as_array)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.argsort(indexer))

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In this revised version, we have removed the type casting logic and simplified the aggregation process to handle nullable integer data types appropriately. This should resolve the type casting issue and ensure that the aggregation operations work correctly with the nullable integer data type.
