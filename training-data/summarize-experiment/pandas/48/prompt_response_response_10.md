Based on the error message, test case, and provided information, it appears that the bug is related to casting float values to integer when performing aggregations, particularly with nullable integer data. The `safe_cast` operation is encountering a "TypeError: Cannot cast array from dtype('float64') to dtype('int64') according to the rule 'safe'" due to the presence of nullable integer data.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the logic in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function to handle nullable integer values appropriately when performing aggregations.

Here's the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # Retrieve the data to aggregate
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.convert_dtypes()  # Convert to nullable integer types

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            # Perform aggregation
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            # Handle non-applicable functions
            if alt is None:
                assert how == "ohlc"
                deleted_items.append(locs)
                continue

            # Call alternative aggregation function
            obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
            s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
            result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))

            # Perform necessary data type conversions
            result = maybe_convert_objects(result)

        # Process the result and append to agg_blocks
        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
        new_items.append(locs)
        agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to our current ordering
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    # Reset locs in the blocks
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset: (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected version of the function:
- Use `convert_dtypes` to explicitly convert the data to nullable integer types when `numeric_only` is True.
- Handle the non-applicable functions by calling alternative aggregation functions and performing necessary data type conversions, such as `maybe_convert_objects`.

This updated function should resolve the casting issue when performing aggregations with nullable integer data and handle the specific data types appropriately.
