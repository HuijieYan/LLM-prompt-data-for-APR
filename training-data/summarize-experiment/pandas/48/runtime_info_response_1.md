Based on the provided buggy function code and the variable logs for each buggy case, we can establish a detailed narrative for each case and identify the specific part of the code that causes the bug.

Analysis of the buggy function code combined with the provided variable logs reveals the following insights for each case:

1. The function `_cython_agg_blocks` seems to be managing and manipulating data blocks.
2. The `data` variable is fetched from `_get_data_to_aggregate` and then possibly filtered using `get_numeric_data`.
3. A loop iterates over the `blocks` within `data`, updating and aggregating values based on certain conditions and operations. Information from the logs provides details about the data types and values at various points within the loop.
4. Based on the logs, it seems that the function is intended to return lists of aggregated data blocks and corresponding index items.

Through the analysis of the logs, it becomes apparent that the function encounters issues in the process of aggregation, potentially due to inaccurate result values and data manipulation.

Further investigation would involve examining the specific blocks of the function that correspond to the outliers in the variable logs, which would allow us to identify the root cause of the bugs and potential fixes.
