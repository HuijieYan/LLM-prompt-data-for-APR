The buggy function `table_exists` is expected to check if a table exists in the specified database and return `True` if the table exists, or `False` if the table does not exist. However, it is failing to return the correct result in certain cases, causing assertion errors in the test cases.

After analyzing the provided logs, it seems that the issue might not be directly related to the `table_exists` function itself, as the `stdout` values in all cases are consistent with successful execution. The inconsistent behavior seen in the test cases could be due to other factors, such as the input parameters, or the external files and methods used in the function, which are not included in the logs.

Additionally, the type of the Hive client object changes between different test cases, indicating a potential issue related to different types of Hive clients being used, or a problem with the objects themselves.

To address the issue, it is crucial to thoroughly review the query and database connection handling within the `table_exists` function and confirm that it is working correctly. It is also advisable to investigate the scenarios in which the `run_hive_cmd` function is not returning the expected output, leading to the `stdout` variable not capturing the proper table information. Debugging the database connection and operations performed by `run_hive_cmd` in a controlled environment may be necessary to uncover the root cause of the problem.

It is also important to ensure that the `table_exists` function accounts for case sensitivity in table names, especially if the table names are expected to be case insensitive in the database.

Based on the analysis and recommendations, I will provide a revised version of the `table_exists` function that addresses the potential issues.

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the revised version of the `table_exists` function, I have added case-insensitive checks by converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase using the `lower()` method. This will ensure that the function accounts for case sensitivity in table names and provides consistent behavior regardless of the case of the input table name.

By incorporating these changes, the `table_exists` function should now accurately determine the existence of tables in the specified database and reconcile the potential issues related to case sensitivity. This revised version can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.
