The buggy function `table_exists` in the `luigi.contrib.hive` module is causing the `test_apacheclient_table_exists` test case to fail. The issue arises due to the incorrect handling of case sensitivity when checking for table existence in the Hive database. The error message "AssertionError: False is not true" indicates that the function is returning `False` when it should be returning `True` in certain cases.

The potential error location is within the comparison logic of the `table_exists` function, specifically when comparing the table name with the output of the Hive command. Additionally, the function may not be handling case sensitivity properly when checking for table existence.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that the `table_exists` function directly compares the table name with the stdout from the Hive command without considering case sensitivity. As a result, when the table names don't match the case of the stdout, the function returns incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the function needs to handle case sensitivity properly by converting both the table name and the output of the Hive command to lowercase before comparison. This will ensure consistent and accurate results regardless of the case used for table names.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected function, the comparison logic is modified to convert both the table name and the stdout to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison. This ensures that the function properly handles case sensitivity and returns the expected results.

The modification addresses the bug by making the table existence check case insensitive, as indicated in the GitHub issue title "Fix #896: make table_exists case insensitive". This ensures that tables with different case formats are correctly identified in the Hive database.
