In the `table_exists` function code, the logic flow inside the `if` condition doesn't appear to be adequate to handle both cases where `partition` is `None` and when it's not. Specifically, it seems that the logic doesn't properly check for the existence of the table.

Looking at the test function corresponding to the buggy function, the `test_apacheclient_table_exists` function, we can see that it is written to test the behavior of the `table_exists` method in the context of the `ApacheClient`. It checks if the function returns `True` when a table exists and `False` otherwise. The test case itself performs multiple assertions.

Based on the error message, we can see that it fails at the assertion `self.assertTrue(returned)`. The error message specifically points out that `False is not true`.

Taking everything into consideration, it seems that the primary issue lies within the `table_exists` function. The code in that function does not fully account for the possible conditions involving `partition`. This leads to the function not working as expected, which is what is manifested in the failed test case.

In conclusion, the bug in question emanates from the incomplete implementation within the `table_exists` function. It does not correctly handle scenarios where `partition` is not `None`. The error message from the failed test case clearly indicates that the `table_exists` function doesn't return the correct result, causing the assertion to fail. Therefore, the bug needs to be fixed within the `table_exists` function to ensure that it operates as intended and passes the given test cases.
