The buggy function `table_exists` from the `luigi.contrib.hive` module is causing the `test_apacheclient_table_exists` test case to fail. The failed test checks whether the given table exists in the Hive database and expects it to return `True`. However, the error message shows that it is returning `False`, which is causing the `AssertionError`.

The `table_exists` function is defined as a method of a class that takes `table`, `database`, and `partition` as input parameters. The error arises from the `else` block of the function. When `partition` is not `None`, the function attempts to run a Hive command to show the partitions, and the result is checked. However, there are issues with the comparison and return statements, which are leading to incorrect test results.

To better understand the problem, letâ€™s examine the code segment of the `test_apacheclient_table_exists` case that's causing the failure.

```python
run_command.return_value = "day=2013-06-28/hour=3\n" \
                           "day=2013-06-28/hour=4\n" \
                           "day=2013-07-07/hour=2\n"
self.apacheclient.partition_spec = mock.Mock(name="partition_spec")
self.apacheclient.partition_spec.return_value = "somepart"
returned = self.apacheclient.table_exists("mytable", partition={'a': 'b'})
self.assertTrue(returned)
```

The `run_command.return_value` above sets the return value of the `run_hive_cmd` mock function. It simulates the output of a Hive command that queries the partitions of a table. Then, the `table_exists` method is called with the table name and a partition. The expected behavior is that it returns `True` if the partitions of the table exist.

However, due to the issues in the `table_exists` function, the test fails, and the error message points to the specific line where the failure occurred.

The error message:
```plaintext
E       AssertionError: False is not true
```
This tells us that the `self.assertTrue(returned)` statement is expecting `True` but receiving `False`.

By combining the error message and relevant portions of the test code, along with the buggy function's code analysis, it is clear that the issue is related to the `table_exists` method's incorrect handling of partition data and the corresponding comparison logic, potentially leading to incorrect return values.

In order to fix this bug, the `table_exists` function's comparison and return logic need to be carefully examined and revised. Additionally, the handling of partition data and the Hive command outputs should be thoroughly checked to ensure accurate detection of table existence in the Hive database.
