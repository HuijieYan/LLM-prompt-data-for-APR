Based on the analysis, the potential error location in the `table_exists` function is the way it handles the `stdout` variable and determines the existence of the table or partition. The function currently returns `True` or `False` based solely on the presence of any output in `stdout`, without properly validating its content.

To fix the bug, we need to refine the conditional statements and return logic to accurately check for the presence of the table or partition based on the actual content of `stdout`. This involves making the function case insensitive for table names and checking the content of `stdout` against the lowercase table name.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())

        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                """use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".
                format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))
            )

            return stdout != ""
```

In this corrected version, we use the `map` function to convert all table names in `stdout` to lowercase and check if the lowercase `table` exists in `stdout`. This makes the comparison case insensitive.

Additionally, we modified the else block to check if the `stdout` is not empty, indicating the existence of the partition.

By implementing these changes, the function now accurately handles both table and partition existence checks, taking into account case insensitivity for table names and properly validating the content of `stdout`. This should address the bug and ensure that the function operates as intended.
