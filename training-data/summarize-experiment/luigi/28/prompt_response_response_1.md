The bug arises from the comparison of the table name in a case-insensitive manner. The `table_exists` function does not account for the case of the table name when comparing it to the output from the Hive command. As a result, when the table name has different case formatting compared to the output from the Hive command, the function incorrectly returns False.

To fix this bug, the comparison logic in the function needs to be modified to perform a case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the output from the Hive command. This will ensure that the function accurately detects the existence of a table regardless of the case formatting.

Here's the revised version of the `table_exists` function with the bug fixed:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the revised version, both the 'table' and 'stdout' are converted to lower case before comparison using the `lower()` method. This ensures a case-insensitive comparison, addressing the bug.

After implementing this fix, the `table_exists` function will accurately determine the existence of a table in the Hive database regardless of the case of the table name. This will resolve the issue identified in the test cases and ensure that the function returns the correct values based on the table existence.
