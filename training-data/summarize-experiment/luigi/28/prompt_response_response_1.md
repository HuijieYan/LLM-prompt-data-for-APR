Based on the analysis of the test case and the function code, it appears that the issue could be related to case sensitivity in table names. The function may not be handling table names consistently due to case differences, leading to the assertion error in the test case.

To address this issue, the function `table_exists` should be modified to ensure case insensitivity when comparing table names in the `stdout`. This can be accomplished by converting both the table name and the `stdout` to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the function that resolves the issue:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass


    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                  (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

This revised version of the function addresses the potential case sensitivity issue by converting both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before comparison, ensuring that the function handles table names in a case-insensitive manner. By implementing this change, the function should now return the correct result for the test case, resolving the assertion error.
