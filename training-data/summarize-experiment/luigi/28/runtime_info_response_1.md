From the buggy function code and the variable logs, we can see that the function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a given table exists in a specified database and partition. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to run a Hive command and return the output. 

In the first buggy case, the input parameters are `table = 'mytable'` and `database = 'default'`. The `stdout` variable has a value of `'OK'`. Since the function is checking for the existence of the table using the `show tables` command, it should return `True` if the table exists and the output contains the table name. However, the condition `return stdout and table in stdout` seems to be incorrect. It doesn't handle the case when the table doesn't exist and the `stdout` value is not the expected output format.

In the second buggy case, the input parameters are `table = 'MyTable'` and `database = 'default'`. The `stdout` variable has a value of `'OK\nmytable'`. Similar to the first case, the condition `return stdout and table in stdout` is not handling the case when the table doesn't exist. The function should return `True` only if the table exists and the output contains the table name.

In the third buggy case, the function is called with a `partition` parameter. We observe that the `stdout` contains partition information instead of table existence. The code seems to be running the `show partitions` command when a `partition` is provided. This behavior does not match the purpose of the `table_exists` function.

Looking at the buggy cases 4, 5, and 6, where the `self` parameter refers to different objects (`HiveCommandClient` in cases 1, 2, and 3, and `ApacheHiveCommandClient` in cases 4, 5, and 6), there might be a difference in behavior between these two types of clients. This inconsistency in behavior could suggest that the `run_hive_cmd` function behaves differently depending on the client type, leading to inaccurate results.

To fix the issues with the `table_exists` function, the conditional statements need to be revised to accurately determine the existence of the table in both cases with and without partition. Additionally, the behaviors of the `run_hive_cmd` function with different types of clients need to be investigated to ensure consistent and correct functionality across all client types.
