Looking at the buggy function code, we can see that it's designed to check for the existence of a table in a Hive database. It has two main branches, one for when the partition is None and another for when a partition is specified.

In the first branch, when the partition is None, the code runs a Hive command to check for the existence of the table in the specified database. It then returns `True` if the table exists in the database and `False` otherwise.

In the second branch, when a partition is specified, the code constructs a command to show partitions for the specified table and database using the `run_hive_cmd` function. If the command outputs anything (i.e., the stdout is not empty), the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

Now, let's analyze each buggy case in detail.

## Buggy case 1:

The input parameters are 'default' for the database, 'mytable' for the table, and a `HiveCommandClient` object for `self`. The variable `stdout` before the return is 'OK'.

Based on the code, the function should return `True` if the table 'mytable' exists in the 'default' database. However, the output indicates that the function returns `False`, which is unexpected.

## Buggy case 2:

The input parameters are 'default' for the database, 'MyTable' for the table, and a `HiveCommandClient` object for `self`. The variable `stdout` before the return is 'OK\nmytable'.

Similar to the previous case, the function should return `True` if the table 'MyTable' exists in the 'default' database. However, the output indicates that the function returns `False`, which is unexpected.

## Buggy case 3:

The input parameters are 'default' for the database, 'mytable' for the table, a dictionary for the partition, and a `Mock` object for `self.partition_spec`. The variable `stdout` before the return includes partition information.

Since the partition is specified, the function should return `True` if there are partitions for the specified table in the 'default' database. However, the output indicates that the function returns `False`, which is unexpected.

## Buggy case 4:

The input parameters are 'default' for the database, 'mytable' for the table, and an `ApacheHiveCommandClient` object for `self`. The variable `stdout` before the return is 'OK'.

Similar to the first case, the function should return `True` if the table 'mytable' exists in the 'default' database. However, the output indicates that the function returns `False`, which is unexpected.

## Buggy case 5:

The input parameters are 'default' for the database, 'MyTable' for the table, and an `ApacheHiveCommandClient` object for `self`. The variable `stdout` before the return is 'OK\nmytable'.

Similar to the second case, the function should return `True` if the table 'MyTable' exists in the 'default' database. However, the output indicates that the function returns `False`, which is unexpected.

## Buggy case 6:

The input parameters are 'default' for the database, 'mytable' for the table, a dictionary for the partition, and a `Mock` object for `self.partition_spec`. The variable `stdout` before the return includes partition information.

Since the partition is specified, the function should return `True` if there are partitions for the specified table in the 'default' database. However, the output indicates that the function returns `False`, which is unexpected.

Based on the provided details, it seems that the function is not correctly identifying the existence of tables or partitions in the database. This behavior may be due to an issue with the command execution (`run_hive_cmd`) or the condition checks in the function.

Further investigation into the exact behavior of the `run_hive_cmd` function and the conditional logic within the `table_exists` function is required to pinpoint the root cause of these failures. Additionally, inspecting the implementation of the `HiveCommandClient` and `ApacheHiveCommandClient` classes might be necessary to understand their differences and how they interact with the `run_hive_cmd` function.
