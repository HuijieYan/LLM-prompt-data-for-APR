Based on the analysis and the provided information, the potential error location within the `table_exists` function seems to be in the conditional check for the table name in the `stdout`. The case sensitivity of the table name comparison might be causing the unexpected behavior seen in the test cases.

The buggy function `table_exists` should be modified to make the comparison case-insensitive, ensuring that the function works correctly with tables regardless of their case. To address this issue, the function should use the lowercased version of the table name for comparison with the lowercased `stdout`.

Here's the corrected version of the function that resolves the issue and makes the comparison case-insensitive:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})")

        return bool(stdout)
```
