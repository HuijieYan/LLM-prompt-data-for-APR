Based on the analysis and the provided information, it seems that the issue with the test case causing assertion error is related to case sensitivity in table names. The `table_exists` function currently performs a case-sensitive check for table existence, which leads to the test cases failing when tables are named with different cases. To address this issue, the function should be modified to perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking for table existence.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()  # Perform a case-insensitive comparison
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

By modifying the comparison to use lowercase versions of the table names, the `table_exists` function now performs a case-insensitive check for table existence, addressing the issue observed in the test cases.

The updated function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version, resolving the issue related to case sensitivity in table name comparisons.
