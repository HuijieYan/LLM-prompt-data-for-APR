Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the associated test cases, the issue appears to stem from the comparison of table names, which is case-sensitive. This leads to incorrect detection of table existence in the Hive database, causing the tests to fail. The root cause of the bug seems to be related to the case sensitivity of table names in the Hive database.

To fix this bug, the comparison of table names should be made case insensitive to align with the behavior of Hive, which treats table names in a case-insensitive manner. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output of the Hive command to lowercase before comparison. Additionally, the function should handle the presence of partition data appropriately to accurately detect the existence of tables and their partitions in the database.

Here's the corrected version of the function that addresses the bug:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In this revised version of the function, the table names are converted to lowercase before comparison to make the check case insensitive. This addresses the issue highlighted in the test cases and aligns the behavior of the function with the case insensitivity of table names in Hive.

This corrected version of the function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version to resolve the bug and ensure the accurate detection of table existence in the Hive database.
