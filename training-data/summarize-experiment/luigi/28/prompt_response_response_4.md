Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout.lower().strip() == table.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout.strip())

```

In the corrected code, we have made the following changes:
1. For the case where `partition` is `None`, we use `stdout.lower().strip() == table.lower()` to perform a case-insensitive comparison to check if the table exists in the database.
2. For the case where `partition` is not `None`, we use `bool(stdout.strip())` to check if the `stdout` is empty or not, which determines the existence of the partition.

These changes ensure that the function accurately checks for the existence of tables and partitions in a case-insensitive manner and addresses the bug by properly handling the output from the Hive commands. This corrected code can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.

If any additional code is required for testing or integration, please let me know.
