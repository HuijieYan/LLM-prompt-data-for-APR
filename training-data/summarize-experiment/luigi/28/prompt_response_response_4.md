Based on the provided information, the bug in the `table_exists` function is related to the case sensitivity when checking for the existence of a table in the `stdout` output from the Hive command. The test function suggests that the comparison between the provided table name and the table names in `stdout` is case-sensitive. Additionally, the function does not handle the case when the table does not exist and the output does not match the expected format.

To address the bug, the `table_exists` function should be modified to make the comparison case-insensitive and handle the case when the table does not exist properly. The conditional statements in the function need to be revised to accurately determine the existence of the table in both cases with and without partition. Additionally, the behavior of the `run_hive_cmd` function with different types of clients should be investigated to ensure consistent and correct functionality across all client types.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function that resolves the issues:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))

        return any(s.lower() == table.lower() for s in stdout.split())
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

This revised function addresses the bug by:
1. Making the table name comparison case-insensitive using the `lower()` method.
2. Checking the existence of a table in the stdout using the `any` function and `split()` method to handle the case when the table does not exist and the output does not match the expected format.
3. Properly handling the partition check by returning the outcome of the `run_hive_cmd` directly.

By implementing these changes, the function now accurately determines the existence of tables in both cases with and without partition, and resolves the case sensitivity issue reported in the test function. This corrected function can serve as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
