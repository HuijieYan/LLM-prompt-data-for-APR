Based on the analysis of the test case and the buggy function, it seems that the issue may be related to a case sensitivity problem in table existence checks. The `table_exists` function does not account for case differences between the provided table name and the actual table name in the database, leading to assertion errors.

To resolve this issue, the `table_exists` function should be updated to perform a case-insensitive check when verifying table existence. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before performing the comparison.

Here's the revised version of the `table_exists` function that resolves the issue and accounts for case insensitivity:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

By converting both the table name and the stdout to lowercase before comparison using `table.lower() in stdout.lower()`, the function ensures a case-insensitive check for table existence, resolving the assertion error observed in the test case.

This updated version of the function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version to address the case sensitivity issue in table existence checks.
