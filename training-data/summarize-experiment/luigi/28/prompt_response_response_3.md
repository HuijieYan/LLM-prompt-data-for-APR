The issue occurs in the `table_exists` function, specifically in the conditional branch where `partition` is None. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` method to check if the given table exists by executing a Hive command. The function then returns True if the stdout is not empty and the table is in the stdout, otherwise it returns False.

The bug causes the function to incorrectly return False when it should return True, leading to assertion errors in the test cases.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the conditional branch for when `partition` is None to ensure that the function correctly identifies the existence of the table. We also need to make sure that table names are matched in a case-insensitive manner, as Hive is case-insensitive.

Here's the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
        return any(t.lower() == table.lower() for t in stdout.split())

    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition
                        ({2})""".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        return bool(stdout)
```

In this corrected code:
- When `partition` is None, the function runs a Hive command to list all the tables and checks if the given table exists in a case-insensitive manner using the `any` function and comparing lowercased table names.
- When `partition` is not None, the function uses the correct Hive command and returns True if the stdout is not empty, otherwise it returns False.

This fix should address the bug by ensuring that the function correctly identifies the existence of the table and handles table names in a case-insensitive manner as required.
