Based on the details provided, it seems that the bug in the `table_exists` function is caused by case sensitivity when comparing the table names obtained from the Hive command output. As a result, the function is returning incorrect results. To fix the bug, we need to make the comparison case-insensitive.

The revised version of the `table_exists` function is as follows:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the revised function, we use the `lower()` method to convert both the `table` and the `stdout` to lowercase for comparison. This approach makes the comparison case-insensitive, addressing the original bug.

The revised function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version in the `HiveCommandClient` or `ApacheHiveCommandClient` classes, resolving the issue related to table existence checks in the Hive database.

Please let me know if you need any further assistance or if there are additional issues that need to be addressed.
