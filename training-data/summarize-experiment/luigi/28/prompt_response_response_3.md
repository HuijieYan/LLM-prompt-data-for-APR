Based on the information provided and the analysis, the bug seems to stem from the `table_exists` function not correctly validating the `stdout` variable to determine the existence of the table or partition. This leads to the function always returning `True`, even when the table or partition does not exist.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to properly validate the `stdout` content and return `True` only when the table or partition genuinely exists. We should also make the function case-insensitive to handle scenarios where Hive returns table names in lowercase.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function that addresses the bug:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
            tables = stdout.split('\n')
            table_lower = table.lower()
            return any(t.lower() == table_lower for t in tables)
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1};'.format(database, table))
            partitions = stdout.split('\n')
            partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
            return partition_spec in partitions
```

In the corrected code, we modified the `if` branch to run a Hive command to show all tables in the database (`show tables`) and then check if the lowercase version of the table name exists in the list of tables returned by Hive.

In the `else` branch, we run a Hive command to show all partitions of the table and then check if the specific partition exists in the list of partitions returned by Hive.

These modifications address the issue of incorrect validation, ensuring that the function now accurately checks for the existence of tables and partitions in the specified database.

Additionally, we made the function case-insensitive by comparing table names in lowercase to handle variations in case between the input and the actual table names returned by Hive.

This corrected version of the function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
