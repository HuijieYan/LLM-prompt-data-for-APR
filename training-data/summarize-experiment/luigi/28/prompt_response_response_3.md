Based on the analysis, the bug in the `table_exists` function arises from incorrect handling of the `stdout` variable when checking for the existence of a table. The function does not account for case sensitivity when comparing the table name with the output from the `run_hive_cmd` function. Additionally, the handling of partitions in the function is not consistent with its intended purpose.

To address the bug, the following actions should be taken:

1. Modify the conditional statements to accurately determine the existence of the table, accounting for case insensitivity.
2. Correct the handling of partitions in the function to align with its intended purpose.
3. Ensure consistent behavior of the `run_hive_cmd` function for different types of clients.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... other methods ...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_spec))
            return stdout.strip() != ""
```

This revised function incorporates case insensitivity when checking for the existence of a table by converting both the table name and the output to lowercase before comparison. Additionally, the handling of partitions has been corrected to return `True` only if the output is not empty.

By implementing these changes, the `table_exists` function should now accurately determine the existence of a table regardless of case sensitivity and handle partitions as intended.

The corrected code can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.
