The potential issue in the `table_exists` function is that it is not handling the case sensitivity of table names correctly. When checking for the existence of a table, the function should consider the case of the table name to ensure accurate matching with the output from the database.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking for the existence of the table.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...
    
    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the corrected code, we are using the `lower()` method to convert both the `table` and `stdout` to lowercase before performing the comparison. This ensures a case-insensitive check for the existence of the table.

By making this modification, we address the issue of case sensitivity when checking for the existence of tables in the database. This should resolve the bug and ensure that the `table_exists` function works as intended, eliminating the assertion error observed in the test case.
