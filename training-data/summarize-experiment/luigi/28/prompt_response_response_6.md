Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})""".format(database, table, partition_spec))

            return bool(stdout)
```

Explanation of changes:
1. In the conditional block where `partition` is `None`, the `stdout` and `table` comparison now uses `lower()` to make the comparison case insensitive. This will ensure that the function correctly identifies the table in the `stdout` response, regardless of case differences.
2. In the conditional block where `partition` is not `None`, the `partition_spec` is now obtained before running the Hive command to check for the existence of the partition. This ensures that the correct partition specification is used in the Hive command.
3. The return statement in the `else` block has been simplified to directly return `bool(stdout)` which will return `True` if `stdout` is not empty, and `False` if it is empty.
4. These modifications address the issues identified in the buggy function by ensuring that the comparison for table existence is case insensitive and that the partition existence is checked accurately based on the `stdout` response.

The corrected code takes into account the potential sources of the bug and provides a fix that addresses the issue by making the function's behavior case insensitive when checking for table existence and accurately handling the partition existence check.
