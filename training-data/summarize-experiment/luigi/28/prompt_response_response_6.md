The provided buggy function `table_exists` in the `HiveCommandClient` class of the `luigi.contrib.hive` module has several issues that lead to failed test cases. The function is designed to check for the existence of a table in a Hive database, but it fails to return the correct results in various scenarios.

Based on the provided tests and error messages, the potential error location within the `table_exists` function is as follows:
- The issue lies in the comparison and return logic of the `table_exists` function, specifically in the handling of the partition data and the comparison of the `stdout` variable with the table name.

The reasons behind the occurrence of the bug are as follows:
- The function is not correctly identifying the existence of tables or partitions in the database due to issues with command execution (`run_hive_cmd`) and conditional logic in the function.
- The comparison between the table name and the `stdout` from the Hive command is not handled properly, leading to incorrect return values.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
- Implementing case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the `stdout` output to ensure accurate detection of table existence, addressing the reported issue #896 regarding case sensitivity.
- Reviewing the conditional logic in the function to ensure correct handling of partition information and the return statements based on the command outputs.
- Verifying the behavior of the `run_hive_cmd` function and inspecting the implementation of the `HiveCommandClient` and `ApacheHiveCommandClient` classes to understand their differences and interactions with the `run_hive_cmd` function.

The corrected code for the problematic `table_exists` function is as follows:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
        return bool(stdout)
```

This corrected function now includes a case-insensitive comparison of the table name with the `stdout` output from the Hive command, as suggested in the GitHub issue.

The revised function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version to resolve the identified issues.
