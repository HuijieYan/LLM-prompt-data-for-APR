## Changes Made
1. In the `table_exists` function, added `lower()` transformation to both `stdout` and `table` before comparison to ensure case-insensitive matching.
2. Stripped any leading or trailing whitespace from the `stdout` after applying the `lower()` transformation.
3. Updated the conditional statement to return `True` if the transformed `stdout` is not an empty string.

The corrected function addresses the issue of case sensitivity when checking for table existence and modifies the conditional statement to accurately determine the table existence, with or without a partition. This fix aligns with the expected behavior and resolves the inconsistency observed in the test cases.
