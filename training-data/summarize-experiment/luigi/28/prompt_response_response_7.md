The buggy function `table_exists` is designed to check for the existence of a table or partition in a database using Hive commands. However, the current implementation does not accurately handle the conditions where `partition` is not `None`, leading to incorrect return values and failed test cases.

The issue arises from the logic within the conditional statements and the reliance on the truthiness of the `stdout` variable without proper content validation. This results in the function always returning `True` regardless of the actual presence of the table or partition.

To address this bug, we can modify the conditional logic and return statements to properly validate the content of the `stdout` variable. By specifically checking for strings or patterns indicative of the existence of the table or partition, we can accurately determine the return value of the function.

Here is the corrected code for the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2})".format(database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))
            return bool(stdout)

    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass
```

In the corrected code:
- For the case when `partition` is `None`, the function checks if the lowercase version of the `table` is in the lowercase `stdout`, making the comparison case insensitive.
- For the case when `partition` is not `None`, the function simply returns `True` if the `stdout` is not empty, indicating the existence of the partition.

By implementing these changes, the function now correctly handles both table and partition existence checks, addressing the bug and ensuring that it functions as intended. This code can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.
