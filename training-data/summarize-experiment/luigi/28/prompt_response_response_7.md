Based on the provided information, the bug in the `table_exists` function arises from the inconsistency in the comparison of table names retrieved from Hive commands. The function returns incorrect results, especially when checking for table existence with different casing.

The inconsistency is manifest in the buggy conditionals that fail to properly handle cases where the table doesn't exist or the output doesn't match the expected format. Additionally, when a partition is provided, the function always returns `True` regardless of the actual outcome of the Hive command, which contradicts the expected behavior.

To resolve the bug, the following steps can be taken:
1. Modify the conditionals inside the `table_exists` function to accurately determine the existence of the table in both cases with and without partition.
2. Use the `table.lower()` function to convert the table name to lowercase before comparison to make the operation case-insensitive.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables;'.format(database))
        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd(f"use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({self.partition_spec(partition)})")
        return bool(stdout)
```


This revised function addresses the issues identified and ensures accurate determination of table existence with case-insensitive comparison. It can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.
