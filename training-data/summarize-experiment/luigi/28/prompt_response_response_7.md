The error in the `table_exists` function is likely related to case sensitivity, as Hive is case insensitive. Thus, when checking for an existing table, the function should compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner to the names returned by Hive.

To address this issue, we can modify the function to compare the table name in a case-insensitive manner by converting both the table name and the names returned by Hive to lowercase before comparing them.

Here's the revised version of the function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)

    # ... omitted code ...
```

In the revised version of the function, the table name and the names returned by Hive are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` function before comparison. This ensures a case-insensitive comparison, addressing the issue with case sensitivity in Hive.

By using this revised function, the case sensitivity issue in the `table_exists` function should be resolved, and the function should behave as expected in a case-insensitive manner.
