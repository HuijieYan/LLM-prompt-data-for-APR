Based on the analysis of the test case and the error message, it is evident that the issue lies within the `table_exists` method of the `HiveCommandClient` and `ApacheHiveCommandClient` classes in the `contrib.hive` module. The function does not handle the table existence check and partitioning correctly, resulting in inconsistent and inaccurate results.

The function improperly handles the return value of `run_hive_cmd` and its comparison with the table name. Additionally, the function does not differentiate the behavior based on different client types (`HiveCommandClient` and `ApacheHiveCommandClient`). As a result, the function is not reliable in determining the existence of tables and partitions.

To address this bug, the following steps are recommended:
1. Update the function to correctly handle the return value of `run_hive_cmd` and the comparison with the table name.
2. Ensure that the function behaves consistently across different client types by handling the behavior based on the class type.
3. Implement case-insensitive comparison between the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to address the issue of capitalization sensitivity.

Here is the revised version of the `table_exists` function that resolves the identified issues:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    # ... omitted code ...

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table.lower()))
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            if isinstance(self, ApacheHiveCommandClient):
                stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                    """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table.lower(), self.partition_spec(partition)))
            else:
                stdout = run_hive_cmd(
                    """use %s; show partitions %s partition (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            return bool(stdout)
```

In this revised version, the function now consistently handles the case sensitivity issue by converting both the table name and the output from `run_hive_cmd` to lowercase for comparison. Additionally, the function differentiates the behavior based on the client type by checking the instance type.

This corrected version of the function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the original buggy version.
