Based on the analysis of the buggy function and the test case causing the error, it is evident that the issue is related to case sensitivity in the table names. The function `table_exists` does not account for case sensitivity, leading to test failures when the table names have different cases.

To address this issue, the function needs to be modified to perform a case-insensitive check when searching for table names in the database.

Here is the corrected version of the `table_exists` function:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # signature of a relative function in this class
    def partition_spec(self, partition):
        # ... omitted code ...
        pass

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                                (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

            if stdout:
                return True
            else:
                return False
```

In the revised `table_exists` function, the comparison between the table name and the tables in the database is performed after converting both to lowercase using the `lower()` method. This ensures that the comparison is case-insensitive, addressing the underlying issue.

The correction takes into account the reported error related to case sensitivity when searching for table names in the database. By making the comparison case-insensitive, the function now behaves as expected and should resolve the test failures related to this issue.
