The bug in the `table_exists` function is due to its reliance on the truthiness of the `stdout` variable without proper validation of its content. The function returns True based solely on the presence of output in `stdout`, leading to incorrect results.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the conditional logic to properly handle the output of the Hive commands and determine the existence of the table or partition based on the actual content of `stdout`. By including checks for specific strings or patterns in the `stdout` variable, we can ensure that the function only returns `True` when the table or partition genuinely exists, and `False` otherwise.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
        return table.lower() in map(str.lower, stdout.split())
    else:
        partition_spec = self.partition_spec(partition)
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show partitions {1} partition ({2});'.format(database, table, partition_spec))
        return bool(stdout)
```

In the corrected code:
1. When `partition` is None, we use `map(str.lower, stdout.split())` to convert the table names to lower case and then check if the given table is in the list.
2. When `partition` is not None, we directly check if `stdout` is not empty to determine the existence of the partition.

This fixed code ensures that the function accurately checks for the existence of tables and partitions in the specified database and returns the correct boolean result.
