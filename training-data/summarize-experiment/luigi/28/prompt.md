    self.assertFalse(returned)
```

Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:
The error message is from the test function test_apacheclient_table_exists in the `contrib.hive_test.py` which uses the `run_hive_cmd` function from the `contrib.hive` module via the `mock.patch` decorator.

The error specifically points to the line 175 in `contrib.hive_test.py`, which asserts that `returned` is `True`, but it is actually `False`. In other words, the failure is due to the statement `self.assertTrue(returned)` returning `False` instead of the expected `True`.

To identify the cause of this failure, it is important to closely examine the `apacheclient.table_exists` method being called in the test function, and its interaction with the `run_hive_cmd` mock object. Additionally, we must also review the implementation of `table_exists` method in the `contrib.hive` module.

The `table_exists` function determines whether a table exists in a given database and partition. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` method to execute the corresponding Hive command for obtaining the list of existing tables or partitions.

The first test case passes successfully as the return value from `run_hive_cmd` is "OK" and the table name does not appear in the result, so it asserts `self.assertFalse(returned)`.

The second test case also passes when the return value from `run_hive_cmd` is "OK\nmytable", thus it correctly asserts `self.assertTrue(returned)`.

The third test case fails when `run_command` returns "OK\nMyTable", the test expects `returned` to be `True`, but it returns `False`. This suggests that the function `table_exists` in the `contrib.hive` module might be case-sensitive in its comparison operation.

To further understand the inconsistency, the implementation of the `table_exists` function is examined. It checks for partition and then executes a Hive command using `run_hive_cmd`. In the section of the code where a partition is provided, the `table_exists` function seems to always return `True` regardless of the outcome of the hive command, which contradicts the expected behavior. This explains why the test case expects `True` but receives `False`.

Upon further review, it becomes evident that the handling of partitions in the `table_exists` method is not properly integrated. This results in the test asserting `True` for partition-based test cases irrespective of the actual outcome. Consequently, it is necessary to modify the `table_exists` method in the `contrib.hive` module, especially the section handling partitioning. This should fix the inconsistency and align it with the behavior expected by the test cases.

In conclusion, the error messages, alongside the test function code, provided clear insights into the significance of the defects in the `table_exists` function and facilitated accurate diagnosis for resolving the bug.



## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

From the buggy function code and the variable logs, we can see that the function `table_exists` is supposed to check if a given table exists in a specified database and partition. The function uses the `run_hive_cmd` function to run a Hive command and return the output. 

In the first buggy case, the input parameters are `table = 'mytable'` and `database = 'default'`. The `stdout` variable has a value of `'OK'`. Since the function is checking for the existence of the table using the `show tables` command, it should return `True` if the table exists and the output contains the table name. However, the condition `return stdout and table in stdout` seems to be incorrect. It doesn't handle the case when the table doesn't exist and the `stdout` value is not the expected output format.

In the second buggy case, the input parameters are `table = 'MyTable'` and `database = 'default'`. The `stdout` variable has a value of `'OK\nmytable'`. Similar to the first case, the condition `return stdout and table in stdout` is not handling the case when the table doesn't exist. The function should return `True` only if the table exists and the output contains the table name.

In the third buggy case, the function is called with a `partition` parameter. We observe that the `stdout` contains partition information instead of table existence. The code seems to be running the `show partitions` command when a `partition` is provided. This behavior does not match the purpose of the `table_exists` function.

Looking at the buggy cases 4, 5, and 6, where the `self` parameter refers to different objects (`HiveCommandClient` in cases 1, 2, and 3, and `ApacheHiveCommandClient` in cases 4, 5, and 6), there might be a difference in behavior between these two types of clients. This inconsistency in behavior could suggest that the `run_hive_cmd` function behaves differently depending on the client type, leading to inaccurate results.

To fix the issues with the `table_exists` function, the conditional statements need to be revised to accurately determine the existence of the table in both cases with and without partition. Additionally, the behaviors of the `run_hive_cmd` function with different types of clients need to be investigated to ensure consistent and correct functionality across all client types.

# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
hive table_exists should be case insensitive?
```

## The associated detailed issue description
```text
Any thoughts on this one?\n\nIn https://github.com/spotify/luigi/blob/master/luigi/contrib/hive.py#L141\n(possibly here too, but we're not on CDH: https://github.com/spotify/luigi/blob/master/luigi/contrib/hive.py#L192)\n\nSometimes we have tables that are defined as capitalized, rather than lower case underscored names. These are easier to read in code if left capitalized, though hive is case insensitive, and will return them as lower case.\n\nE.g. when checking for an existing table table = 'FooBar', stdout will return with foobar and the test will fail\n\nThis wasn't an issue in older versions, which just checked for string \"does not exist\" or \"Table not found\" in stdout.\n\nWould be easy to fix using return stdout and table.lower() in stdout or return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()\n\nLet me know your thoughts on this. I can supply a pull request if necessary.\n\nThanks,\nLin.
