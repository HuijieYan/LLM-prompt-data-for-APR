Please correct the malfunctioning function provided below by using the relevant information listed to address this bug. Then, produce a revised version of the function that resolves the issue. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
None
```

The following is the buggy function that you need to fix:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False

```



## Functions Used in the Buggy Function
```python# class declaration containing the buggy function

## Test Case Summary
The error message indicates that there is an assertion error in the `test_apacheclient_table_exists` function of the `hive_test.py` file. Specifically, the assertion `self.assertTrue(returned)` is failing with the error message `AssertionError: False is not true`.

To understand the cause of this error, let's analyze the relevant portion of the `test_apacheclient_table_exists` function code along with the corresponding buggy function code.

In the `test_apacheclient_table_exists` function, the test case that causes the assertion error can be isolated:
```python
returned = self.apacheclient.table_exists("MyTable")
self.assertTrue(returned)
```
This test case calls the `table_exists` function of the `apacheclient` and asserts that the return value should be `True`, but the test fails with the assertion error.

Now, let's compare the `table_exists` function code with the test case that is causing the error. The `table_exists` function first checks the `stdout` variable:
```python
stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))
```
After this line, it checks if `stdout` is not empty and the table exists in the `stdout`. This indicates that the `table_exists` function is expected to check whether a table exists in the database and return `True` if the table exists, or `False` if the table does not exist.

Now, revisiting the test case causing the error, if `table_exists("MyTable")` is returning `False`, it means the assertion failure is caused because the expected table "MyTable" is not being found, which directly contradicts the expected behavior specified in the `table_exists` function.

Given the evidence, the most probable cause of the error is that the `table_exists` function is not correctly identifying the tables in the database, potentially due to a problem with the query being sent to the database or an issue with the database connection itself.

To address this issue, it is crucial to thoroughly review the query and database connection handling within the `table_exists` function and confirm that it is working correctly. It is also advisable to investigate the scenarios in which the `run_hive_cmd` function is not returning the expected output, leading to the `stdout` variable not capturing the proper table information. Additionally, debugging the database connection and operations performed by `run_hive_cmd` in a controlled environment may be necessary to uncover the root cause of the problem.

In summary, the underlying problem leading to the assertion error in the `test_apacheclient_table_exists` function is most likely caused by an issue within the `table_exists` function related to the query execution or database interaction. A comprehensive debugging and testing process focusing on the database query and the behavior of the `run_hive_cmd` function is essential for identifying and resolving the source of the error.



## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

In this buggy function, `table_exists`, there seems to be a conditional structure that checks if the `partition` parameter is None.

In the first case, when `partition` is indeed None, the function runs a Hive command to check if the given table exists. It then returns True if the stdout is not empty and the table is in the stdout. Otherwise, it returns False. From the provided logs, in both buggy cases 1 and 2, the `stdout` variable holds the value "OK" in the first case and "OK\nmytable" in the second case. This indicates that the Hive command ran successfully and returned the expected response.

In the second conditional branch where `partition` is not None, the function constructs and executes a different Hive command to check for partitions. The function should return True if the `stdout` is not empty and False otherwise.

In buggy case 3, we see that the `stdout` variable holds the value:
```
day=2013-06-28/hour=3
day=2013-06-28/hour=4
day=2013-07-07/hour=2
```
This output is consistent with the expected behavior, indicating that the Hive command worked as intended.

Given this analysis, it seems that the issue might not be directly related to the `table_exists` function itself, as the `stdout` values in all cases are consistent with successful execution.

The inconsistent behavior seen in the test cases could be due to other factors, such as the input parameters, or the external files and methods used in the function, which are not included in the logs.

It's also worth noting that the type of the `HiveCommandClient` object changes between buggy cases 1 and 4, from `HiveCommandClient` to `ApacheHiveCommandClient`. This might indicate a potential issue related to different types of Hive clients being used, or a problem with the objects themselves.

To complete the debugging process, additional information about the input parameters and the `run_hive_cmd` function would be necessary to determine the exact cause of the inconsistencies seen in the test cases.

hive table_exists should be case insensitive?
```

## The associated detailed issue description
```text
Any thoughts on this one?\n\nIn https://github.com/spotify/luigi/blob/master/luigi/contrib/hive.py#L141\n(possibly here too, but we're not on CDH: https://github.com/spotify/luigi/blob/master/luigi/contrib/hive.py#L192)\n\nSometimes we have tables that are defined as capitalized, rather than lower case underscored names. These are easier to read in code if left capitalized, though hive is case insensitive, and will return them as lower case.\n\nE.g. when checking for an existing table table = 'FooBar', stdout will return with foobar and the test will fail\n\nThis wasn't an issue in older versions, which just checked for string \"does not exist\" or \"Table not found\" in stdout.\n\nWould be easy to fix using return stdout and table.lower() in stdout or return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()\n\nLet me know your thoughts on this. I can supply a pull request if necessary.\n\nThanks,\nLin.
