```

Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:
The buggy function `table_exists` from the `luigi.contrib.hive` module is causing the `test_apacheclient_table_exists` test case to fail. The failed test checks whether the given table exists in the Hive database and expects it to return `True`. However, the error message shows that it is returning `False`, which is causing the `AssertionError`.

The `table_exists` function is defined as a method of a class that takes `table`, `database`, and `partition` as input parameters. The error arises from the `else` block of the function. When `partition` is not `None`, the function attempts to run a Hive command to show the partitions, and the result is checked. However, there are issues with the comparison and return statements, which are leading to incorrect test results.

To better understand the problem, letâ€™s examine the code segment of the `test_apacheclient_table_exists` case that's causing the failure.

```python
run_command.return_value = "day=2013-06-28/hour=3\n" \
                           "day=2013-06-28/hour=4\n" \
                           "day=2013-07-07/hour=2\n"
self.apacheclient.partition_spec = mock.Mock(name="partition_spec")
self.apacheclient.partition_spec.return_value = "somepart"
returned = self.apacheclient.table_exists("mytable", partition={'a': 'b'})
self.assertTrue(returned)
```

The `run_command.return_value` above sets the return value of the `run_hive_cmd` mock function. It simulates the output of a Hive command that queries the partitions of a table. Then, the `table_exists` method is called with the table name and a partition. The expected behavior is that it returns `True` if the partitions of the table exist.

However, due to the issues in the `table_exists` function, the test fails, and the error message points to the specific line where the failure occurred.

The error message:
```plaintext
E       AssertionError: False is not true
```
This tells us that the `self.assertTrue(returned)` statement is expecting `True` but receiving `False`.

By combining the error message and relevant portions of the test code, along with the buggy function's code analysis, it is clear that the issue is related to the `table_exists` method's incorrect handling of partition data and the corresponding comparison logic, potentially leading to incorrect return values.

In order to fix this bug, the `table_exists` function's comparison and return logic need to be carefully examined and revised. Additionally, the handling of partition data and the Hive command outputs should be thoroughly checked to ensure accurate detection of table existence in the Hive database.



## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

Looking at the buggy function code, we can see that it's designed to check for the existence of a table in a Hive database. It has two main branches, one for when the partition is None and another for when a partition is specified.

In the first branch, when the partition is None, the code runs a Hive command to check for the existence of the table in the specified database. It then returns `True` if the table exists in the database and `False` otherwise.

In the second branch, when a partition is specified, the code constructs a command to show partitions for the specified table and database using the `run_hive_cmd` function. If the command outputs anything (i.e., the stdout is not empty), the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

Now, let's analyze each buggy case in detail.

## Buggy case 1:

The input parameters are 'default' for the database, 'mytable' for the table, and a `HiveCommandClient` object for `self`. The variable `stdout` before the return is 'OK'.

Based on the code, the function should return `True` if the table 'mytable' exists in the 'default' database. However, the output indicates that the function returns `False`, which is unexpected.

## Buggy case 2:

The input parameters are 'default' for the database, 'MyTable' for the table, and a `HiveCommandClient` object for `self`. The variable `stdout` before the return is 'OK\nmytable'.

Similar to the previous case, the function should return `True` if the table 'MyTable' exists in the 'default' database. However, the output indicates that the function returns `False`, which is unexpected.

## Buggy case 3:

The input parameters are 'default' for the database, 'mytable' for the table, a dictionary for the partition, and a `Mock` object for `self.partition_spec`. The variable `stdout` before the return includes partition information.

Since the partition is specified, the function should return `True` if there are partitions for the specified table in the 'default' database. However, the output indicates that the function returns `False`, which is unexpected.

## Buggy case 4:

The input parameters are 'default' for the database, 'mytable' for the table, and an `ApacheHiveCommandClient` object for `self`. The variable `stdout` before the return is 'OK'.

Similar to the first case, the function should return `True` if the table 'mytable' exists in the 'default' database. However, the output indicates that the function returns `False`, which is unexpected.

## Buggy case 5:

The input parameters are 'default' for the database, 'MyTable' for the table, and an `ApacheHiveCommandClient` object for `self`. The variable `stdout` before the return is 'OK\nmytable'.

Similar to the second case, the function should return `True` if the table 'MyTable' exists in the 'default' database. However, the output indicates that the function returns `False`, which is unexpected.

## Buggy case 6:

The input parameters are 'default' for the database, 'mytable' for the table, a dictionary for the partition, and a `Mock` object for `self.partition_spec`. The variable `stdout` before the return includes partition information.

Since the partition is specified, the function should return `True` if there are partitions for the specified table in the 'default' database. However, the output indicates that the function returns `False`, which is unexpected.

Based on the provided details, it seems that the function is not correctly identifying the existence of tables or partitions in the database. This behavior may be due to an issue with the command execution (`run_hive_cmd`) or the condition checks in the function.

Further investigation into the exact behavior of the `run_hive_cmd` function and the conditional logic within the `table_exists` function is required to pinpoint the root cause of these failures. Additionally, inspecting the implementation of the `HiveCommandClient` and `ApacheHiveCommandClient` classes might be necessary to understand their differences and how they interact with the `run_hive_cmd` function.

# A GitHub issue title for this bug

hive table_exists should be case insensitive?
```

## The associated detailed issue description
```text
Any thoughts on this one?\n\nIn https://github.com/spotify/luigi/blob/master/luigi/contrib/hive.py#L141\n(possibly here too, but we're not on CDH: https://github.com/spotify/luigi/blob/master/luigi/contrib/hive.py#L192)\n\nSometimes we have tables that are defined as capitalized, rather than lower case underscored names. These are easier to read in code if left capitalized, though hive is case insensitive, and will return them as lower case.\n\nE.g. when checking for an existing table table = 'FooBar', stdout will return with foobar and the test will fail\n\nThis wasn't an issue in older versions, which just checked for string \"does not exist\" or \"Table not found\" in stdout.\n\nWould be easy to fix using return stdout and table.lower() in stdout or return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()\n\nLet me know your thoughts on this. I can supply a pull request if necessary.\n\nThanks,\nLin.
