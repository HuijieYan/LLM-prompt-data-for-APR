The `table_exists` function takes in the parameters `table`, `database`, and `partition`, and based on the value of `partition`, it runs a Hive command and returns a boolean value.

If `partition` is None, the function runs the Hive command `use {database}; show tables like "{table}"` and checks if the `table` is in the `stdout` response. It returns `True` if `table` is in the `stdout` and `False` otherwise.

If `partition` is not None, the function runs the Hive command `use {database}; show partitions {table} partition ({partition_spec})` and returns `True` if the `stdout` is not empty, and `False` if the `stdout` is empty.

Based on these conditions and the expected values of `stdout`, the function's logic is tied to checking the existence of a table in a database in the Hive environment. The function returns `True` if the table exists and `False` if it does not.

The `stdout` variable is crucial in both branches of the conditional statements, as it holds the response of the Hive command and determines the return value of the function based on its contents.
