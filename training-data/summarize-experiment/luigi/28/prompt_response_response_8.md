Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function that addresses the bug:

```python
class HiveCommandClient(HiveClient):
    """
    Uses `hive` invocations to find information.
    """

    def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
        if partition is None:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table)).lower()
            return stdout and table.lower() in stdout
        else:
            stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition))).lower()
            return stdout != ""
```

In the corrected code, we use the `lower()` method to ensure that the comparison between table names and the stdout response is case insensitive. This addresses the issue of table names being returned in lowercase from Hive, causing the comparison to fail in the original code.

By using `stdout.lower()` and `table.lower()` in the comparisons, we can ensure that the function correctly identifies the existence of the table regardless of the case of its name.

This fix supports the proposed solution from the GitHub issue, which suggested making the `table_exists` function case insensitive. With these changes, the function now correctly handles the varying case of table names in the Hive environment and provides the expected boolean results for table existence checks.
