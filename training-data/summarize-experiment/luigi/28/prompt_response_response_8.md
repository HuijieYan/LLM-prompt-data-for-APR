Based on the provided information, the bug seems to be related to a case sensitivity issue in the `table_exists` function. The function checks for table existence by comparing the table name with the results from the Hive command, but it doesn't account for case differences. This leads to false negatives when checking for table existence, causing the test cases to fail.

To address this bug, the function needs to be modified to perform a case-insensitive comparison when checking for table existence. This can be achieved by converting both the table name and the output from the Hive command to lowercase before comparison.

Here's the corrected version of the `table_exists` function that resolves the case sensitivity issue:

```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table.lower() in stdout.lower()
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False
```

In the corrected version, both the `table` and `stdout` are converted to lowercase using the `lower()` method before comparison, ensuring a case-insensitive check for table existence.

This fix should resolve the assertion error encountered in the test cases, as it addresses the case insensitivity issue in the `table_exists` function.
