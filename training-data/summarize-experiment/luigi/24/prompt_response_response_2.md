The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is due to the value from the dictionary not being correctly formatted and appended to the command list. This is indicated by the assertion error in the `test_defaults` function, where the expected and actual command list differs in the formatting of values from the dictionary.

To fix this bug, the conditional statement for determining whether the input value is a non-empty dictionary needs to be corrected. Additionally, the values from the dictionary should be formatted in a manner compatible with the input requirements of `spark-submit`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Change the variable name from value to val to avoid overwriting the input variable
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Format the value from the dictionary with quotation marks
    return command
```

With this correction, the values from the dictionary will be correctly formatted and appended to the command list, resolving the bug. This revised function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.
