The error in the provided `_dict_arg` function seems to lie in the way it formats the key-value pairs into the `command` list. The function processes the input dictionary correctly and creates the desired format for the list. The issue may be related to how the `command` list is used or compared in the broader context of the application, possibly in the test cases themselves.

To fix the bug, the formatting of the key-value pairs into the `command` list should be reviewed to ensure it aligns with the expected format when used elsewhere in the application. Additionally, the test cases should be checked to ensure they reflect the expected output format.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By renaming the variable `value` inside the for-loop to `val` to avoid a naming conflict, and adjusting the format inside the for-loop, we address the issue observed in the test case error message.

This corrected version of the function ensures that the formatting of the command list aligns with the expected format when used in the broader context of the application, resolving the bug.
