Based on the provided information, the bug seems to be related to the `_dict_arg` function and its handling of dictionary values. The issue appears to be the incorrect formatting of the dictionary key-value pairs when generating the `command` list.

To fix the bug, the `_dict_arg` function should be revised to ensure that the dictionary key-value pairs are formatted correctly with quotes around the values.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function that resolves the issue:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
