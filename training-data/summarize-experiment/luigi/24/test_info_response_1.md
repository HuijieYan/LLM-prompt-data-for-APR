The `test_defaults` function specifically tests the behaviour of the `job.run()` method within the `TestDefaultSparkSubmitTask()` class, which inherits from `SparkSubmitTask`.

The error message indicates that an `AssertionError` was raised because the `self.assertEqual` statement within `test_defaults` failed. The `proc.call_args[0][0]` list differed from the expected list. Specifically, the difference was in element 12, where the expected value was a string with quotation marks `" "` around it, whereas the actual value did not have quotation marks around it.

Relevant section of error message:
```
E       AssertionError: Lists differ: ['ss-[131 chars] '--archives', 'archive1', '--conf', '"prop1=val1"', 'test.py'] != ['ss-[131 chars] '--archives', 'archive1', '--conf', 'prop1=val1', 'test.py']
E       First differing element 12:
E       '"prop1=val1"'
E       'prop1=val1'
```

This discrepancy is attributed to the default master setup in the `job.run()` operation. This happens when the input dictionary `value` does not represent a valid configuration for `spark-submit`. This faulty outcome points to a failure in parsing the input dictionary `value` in the `SparkSubmitTask` class.

By examining the `_dict_arg` function, it's clear that when the `_dict_arg` function is invoked, it accumulates values from the input dictionary, and the issue most likely stems from the formatting of these values in the command list, `command`.

In order to resolve this issue, the `_dict_arg` function needs modification. Specifically, the if condition for determining whether the input value is a non-empty dictionary is flawed, hence producing the error.

Correcting the conditional statement will solve this issue and ensure that the values from the dictionary are correctly appended to the command list. Furthermore, it is essential to confirm that the values are formatted in a manner compatible with the input requirements of `spark-submit`.
