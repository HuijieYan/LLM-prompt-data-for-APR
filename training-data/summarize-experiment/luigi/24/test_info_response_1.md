Upon carefully examining the code for the `test_defaults` function, which constitutes a unit test for the `TestDefaultSparkSubmitTask` class, it involves patching the `subprocess.Popen` object and setting the return value for `proc` to 0. From the test code, it's evident that the underlying data for the test involves comparisons of lists using the `self.assertEqual` method. The expected list is compared against a list assembled from `proc.call_args[0][0]`. 

The error message indicates that there is an AssertionError. Specifically, the issue occurs when comparing two lists, and the error message provides details about which elements of the lists differ. The comparison of the lists, which are outputs of the `proc.call_args[0][0]` extraction, reveals that the string being compared is for '--conf'. The original list includes an item "--conf", followed by the value of prop1=val1 within double quotes: '"prop1=val1"'. In comparison, the corresponding position in the tested list includes "--conf", followed by the value "prop1=val1" without the double quotes. This is visible from the error message where the output lists are given and the exact position in the lists where the difference is encountered.

For the input that caused this error, it's evident that the `prop1=val1` for the `conf` part of the command that is being executed by the `subprocess.Popen` object is not formatted as expected, resulting in the test failure.

To address this issue, the `_dict_arg` method in the source code should be amended to handle formatting of the 'conf' value in a consistent manner, or the tests should reflect that change by providing the expected format in the test case.
