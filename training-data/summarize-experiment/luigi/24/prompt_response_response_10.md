The error in the `_dict_arg` function occurs because the values in the dictionary are being added to the `command` list without proper quoting, leading to discrepancies in the expected and actual lists. To fix this, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to ensure that the values in the dictionary are properly quoted before being added to the `command` list.

Here's the revised version of the `_dict_arg` function to address the bug:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This revised version of the function ensures that the values in the dictionary are properly quoted before being added to the `command` list. This will resolve the issue of discrepancies in the expected and actual lists, as mentioned in the test case summary.
