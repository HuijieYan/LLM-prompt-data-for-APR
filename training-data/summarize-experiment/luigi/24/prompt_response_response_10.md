The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line where the key-value pairs are being appended to the command list. This line does not correctly format the string as per the expected test cases.

The bug occurred because the function did not format the key-value pairs in the expected format, leading to test failures. The expected format for the key-value pairs in the `command` list should be `"{name}={prop}={value}"` but the current implementation does not handle this formatting correctly.

To fix this bug, we need to adjust the formatting of the string that is appended to the `command` list so that it matches the expected format. We also need to ensure that the keys and values are appropriately extracted from the input dictionary.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
