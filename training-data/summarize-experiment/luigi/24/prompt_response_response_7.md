The bug in the _dict_arg function stems from the incorrect formatting of the command list. The current implementation does not properly handle quoting for key-value pairs when creating the command list. This results in the assertion error in the test case, specifically related to the --conf option.

To fix the bug, the _dict_arg function needs to ensure that the key-value pairs are formatted with proper quoting when added to the command list.

Here's the corrected code for the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
