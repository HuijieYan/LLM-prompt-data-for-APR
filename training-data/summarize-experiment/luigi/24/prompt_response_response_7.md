The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is due to the incorrect formatting of the command list when appending values from the input dictionary. The conditional statement for determining whether the input value is a non-empty dictionary is flawed, leading to the error.

To fix this bug, the conditional statement needs to be corrected to ensure that values from the dictionary are correctly appended to the command list. Additionally, the values should be formatted in a manner compatible with the input requirements of `spark-submit`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With the corrected function, the values from the dictionary will be properly formatted and appended to the command list, resolving the issue and ensuring compatibility with the input requirements of `spark-submit`.
