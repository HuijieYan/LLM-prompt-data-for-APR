Looking at the provided function code and the variable logs from the two buggy cases, we can identify a potential issue that might be causing the buggy behavior.

In the `_dict_arg` function, the input parameters consist of `name` and `value`. The function then checks if the `value` is truthy and is an instance of a dictionary. If both conditions are true, it iterates through the key-value pairs of the dictionary and appends a modified string to the `command` list.

In the first buggy case, the input parameter `value` is `{'Prop': 'Value'}` and the `name` is `--conf`. The variable `command` at the moment before the function returns has the value `['--conf', 'Prop=Value']`. The individual values of `prop`, `value`, and the modified string in the `command` list all correspond correctly to the input dictionary and its key-value pairs.

Similarly, in the second buggy case, the input parameter `value` is `{'prop1': 'val1'}` and the `name` is `--conf`. The variable `command` at the moment before the function returns has the value `['--conf', 'prop1=val1']`. Again, the individual values of `prop`, `value`, and the modified string in the `command` list correspond correctly to the input dictionary and its key-value pairs.

From the analysis of these specific cases and the function code, it seems that the function is correctly processing the input dictionary and formatting the key-value pairs into the `command` list.

Therefore, the potential issue might lie outside the `_dict_arg` function, possibly in the way the `command` list is being used or compared in the broader context of the application. It could also be a problem in the test cases themselves, such as incorrect expected output values.

Further exploration beyond the provided function code and variable logs is necessary to uncover the root cause of the buggy behavior. This could involve examining how the `command` list is used or checking other parts of the application that interact with the `_dict_arg` function.
