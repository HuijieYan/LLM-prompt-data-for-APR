The error in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the incorrect formatting of the values when constructing the command list. The string formatting for each property and value needs to include double quotes around the property=value pair.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to ensure that the property=value pairs are formatted with double quotes when constructing the command list.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
