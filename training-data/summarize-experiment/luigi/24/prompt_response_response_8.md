Based on the provided information, the bug in the `_dict_arg` function is caused by the incorrect handling of dictionary values and their formatting in the command list. The conditional statement to check if the input is a valid dictionary is also flawed.

The issue occurs when the function tries to accumulate values from the input dictionary and format them in a manner compatible with the input requirements of `spark-submit`. The incorrect formatting leads to a discrepancy in the expected and actual values, resulting in an `AssertionError` in the test case.

To fix the bug, the conditional statement should be modified to check for a non-empty dictionary as the first condition. Then, the values from the dictionary should be correctly formatted and appended to the command list.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):  # Check for non-empty dictionary
        for prop, val in value.items():  # Use val instead of reusing value
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]  # Format the values correctly
    return command
```

With the above fix, the `_dict_arg` function now correctly handles the input dictionary values and formats them according to the requirements of `spark-submit`. The revised function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version, effectively resolving the issue.
