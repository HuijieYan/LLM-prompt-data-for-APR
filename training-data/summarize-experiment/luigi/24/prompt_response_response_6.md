The potential error location within the problematic function appears to be in the way the "command" list is being assembled and returned. The function correctly processes the input dictionary and formats the key-value pairs into the "command" list, but there may be an issue with how this "command" list is used or compared in the broader context of the application, possibly in the test cases themselves.

The bug occurs because the "command" list elements are not being formatted consistently with the expected output in the test cases. The string formatting within the list is not always enclosed in double quotes, leading to an inconsistency in the expected comparison.

To fix the bug, we can adjust the string formatting within the "command" list to ensure it consistently matches the expected output in the test cases.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
