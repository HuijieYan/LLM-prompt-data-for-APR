The bug in the `_dict_arg` function is due to the incorrect quoting of the key-value pairs when constructing the command list. 

When a dictionary is passed to the function, the function iterates over the key-value pairs and adds them to the `command` list without proper quoting. This results in a mismatch between the expected and actual command arguments when used in the test case.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the key-value pairs in the `command` list are properly formatted with quotes around the value.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

With this fix, the key-value pairs in the `command` list will now be properly formatted with quotes around the value, resolving the bug and ensuring that the test case passes successfully.
