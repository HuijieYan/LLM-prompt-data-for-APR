The bug in the `_dict_arg` function lies in the conditional statement that checks whether the input `value` is a non-empty dictionary. This conditional check is flawed, and it leads to incorrect formatting of the command list `command`.

The bug occurs when the input dictionary `value` does not represent a valid configuration for `spark-submit`. This results in incorrect formatting of the command list, causing an `AssertionError` in the test cases.

To fix this bug, the conditional statement in the `_dict_arg` function needs to be modified to correctly handle the input dictionary. Additionally, the values from the dictionary must be formatted in a manner compatible with the input requirements of `spark-submit`.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value is not None and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

The key change made is the modification of the conditional statement to check for `value is not None` before further processing. This ensures that the input dictionary is valid and not empty. Additionally, the variable representing the dictionary value inside the loop has been changed to `val` to prevent confusion with the variable name `value` passed as an argument.

This corrected code should resolve the bug by properly handling the input dictionary and formatting the command list accordingly.
