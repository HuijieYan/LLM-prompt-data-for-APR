The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that when adding the key-value pairs from the input dictionary to the `command` list, it's not handling the formatting of the values correctly. The resulting command list does not maintain the correct formatting for key-value pairs, leading to a discrepancy in the output when compared with the expected command list in the test cases.

To fix this bug, the `_dict_arg` function can be modified to properly format the key-value pairs before adding them to the `command` list. This involves ensuring that the values are enclosed in double quotes and separated by an equals sign.

Here's the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the values from the input dictionary will be formatted as expected, ensuring that the resulting command list aligns with the expected output in the test cases. This corrected function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
