Based on the given information and the analysis of the test case and error message, it seems that the _dict_arg function is working correctly. The error message pertains to a discrepancy in the formatting of the '--conf' value, but this discrepancy is not evident in the code provided for the _dict_arg function. Therefore, the issue may lie outside the function or in the test cases themselves.

To address the potential discrepancy in the '--conf' value formatting, it is recommended to first verify that the output of the _dict_arg function is as expected. Then, examine how the 'command' list is being used or compared in the broader context of the application. Additionally, double-check the expected output values in the test cases to ensure they align with the formatting of the '--conf' value.

Here is the corrected code for the _dict_arg function:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
