After analyzing the test case and the buggy function, it is apparent that the bug occurs in the `_dict_arg` function due to the incorrect quoting of the key-value pairs in the dictionary when generating the command list.

The bug occurs because in the `_dict_arg` function, the key-value pairs from the input dictionary are being added to the command list without proper quoting, which leads to the assertion error when comparing the actual and expected arguments.

To fix this bug, the `_dict_arg` function should format the key-value pairs with correct quoting before adding them to the command list. This can be achieved by using double quotes around the formatted key-value pairs.

Here is the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected code ensures that the key-value pairs in the command list are properly quoted, which resolves the bug and aligns with the expected behavior.
