Based on the analysis of the provided function and the test cases, it seems that the function `_dict_arg` is correctly processing the input dictionary and formatting the key-value pairs into the `command` list. Therefore, the potential issue might lie outside the `_dict_arg` function, possibly in the way the `command` list is being used or compared in the broader context of the application. It could also be a problem in the test cases themselves, such as incorrect expected output values.

To fix the bug, it's essential to ensure that the `command` list is being used and compared correctly in the broader context of the application. This may involve reviewing the usage of the `command` list and possibly adjusting the tests to reflect the expected behavior more accurately.

Here's the revised version of the function with some added formatting to ensure consistent output:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command.append(name)
            command.append('"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val))
    return command
```
