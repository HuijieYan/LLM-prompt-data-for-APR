Based on the analysis of the test case and the error message, the issue seems to be related to the improper quoting of the key-value pairs in the `--conf` option when creating the command list. This discrepancy occurs within the `_dict_arg` method when processing the input dictionary.

To fix the bug, the `_dict_arg` method should be modified to include proper quoting for the key-value pairs in the `--conf` option. The key-value pairs should be enclosed within double quotes to ensure correct processing of the command list.

Here's the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` method:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]
    return command
```

With this correction, the key-value pairs within the `--conf` option will be properly enclosed within double quotes, resolving the quoting discrepancy observed in the test case and eliminating the assertion error.
