The issue with the _dict_arg function is that it does not properly handle the formatting of the dictionary values in the command list. The current implementation does not correctly format the values from the input dictionary when appending them to the command list.

The expected behavior is to format the values with quotation marks before appending them to the command list. This is necessary to ensure that the values are formatted in a manner compatible with the input requirements of spark-submit.

To address this issue, we need to modify the conditional statement to properly handle the formatting of dictionary values in the command list, ensuring that they are enclosed in quotation marks.

Here's the corrected code for the _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

By making this change, the values from the input dictionary will be properly formatted with quotation marks before appending them to the command list. This will resolve the issue and ensure that the command list is correctly formatted for use with spark-submit.

The corrected _dict_arg function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
