The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not correctly quoting the key-value pairs when constructing the command list. This results in a discrepancy between the expected and actual values, leading to the assertion error in the test case.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the key-value pairs are properly quoted in the command list. This can be achieved by surrounding the '{0}={1}' format string with double quotes when constructing the command list.

Here's the revised version of the function that resolves the issue:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```
