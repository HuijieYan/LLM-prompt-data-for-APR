Based on the provided information and analysis, it seems that the `_dict_arg` function is correctly processing the input dictionary and formatting the key-value pairs into the `command` list. The issue may lie outside the `_dict_arg` function, possibly in the way the `command` list is being used or compared in the broader context of the application. It could also be a problem in the test cases themselves, such as incorrect expected output values.

To address this bug, it is important to ensure that the formatting of the key-value pairs in the `command` list is consistent with the expected format when used in the broader context of the application. Additionally, the test cases need to be reviewed to ensure that they reflect the correct expected output values for the `command` list.

Here is the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
``` 

This revised version of the `_dict_arg` function ensures that the key-value pairs are formatted consistently with double quotes around the value. This should address any inconsistencies in how the `command` list is being used in the broader context of the application. Additionally, it is important to review the test cases to ensure that they reflect the correct expected output values for the `command` list.
