Summary:
The _dict_arg function takes three parameters: self, name, and value. It checks if the value is not empty and is of type dict. If both conditions are met, it iterates over the key-value pairs in the dictionary and appends them to the command list in the format {name, "prop=value"}. 

In expected case 1, the input parameters value and name are {'Prop': 'Value'} and '--conf' respectively. The expected return command value should be ['--conf', '"Prop=Value"'], and the variables value and prop should have the values 'Value' and 'Prop' respectively.

In expected case 2, the input parameters value and name are {'prop1': 'val1'} and '--conf' respectively. The expected return command value should be ['--conf', '"prop1=val1"'], and the variables value and prop should have the values 'val1' and 'prop1' respectively.
