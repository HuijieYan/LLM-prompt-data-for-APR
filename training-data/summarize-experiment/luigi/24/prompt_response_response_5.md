The potential error is not within the _dict_arg function itself, as the function correctly processes the input dictionary and formats the key-value pairs into the command list.

The error message from the test indicates a discrepancy in the formatting of the '--conf' value, where the expected format includes the value within double quotes, but the actual format does not. This suggests that the issue may lie in the usage or comparison of the 'command' list outside of the _dict_arg function, or in the manner in which the test cases are expecting the values to be formatted.

To address the bug, the test cases should be updated to reflect the expected format of the '--conf' value, or the broader context of the application should be examined to ensure consistent handling of the 'command' list.

Here's the corrected _dict_arg function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
    return command
```

This corrected version ensures that the key-value pairs from the input dictionary are formatted within double quotes before being appended to the command list.
