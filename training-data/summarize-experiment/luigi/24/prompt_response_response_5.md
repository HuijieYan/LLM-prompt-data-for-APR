The issue with the `_dict_arg` function is that it is not wrapping the dictionary key-value pairs in quotes when adding them to the `command` list. This results in the assertion error when comparing the actual and expected lists in the test case.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `_dict_arg` function to correctly format the key-value pairs with quotes before adding them to the `command` list. This can be done by modifying the line that adds the key-value pairs to `command` to include quotes around the formatted string.

Here's the revised version of the `_dict_arg` function that resolves the issue:

```python
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
        command = []
        if value and isinstance(value, dict):
            for prop, val in value.items():
                command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, val)]
        return command
```

With this modification, the `prop=value` pairs from the input dictionary will now be formatted with quotes and added to the command list, resolving the assertion error in the test case.
