The issue in the `_dict_arg` function arises from the incorrect formatting of the values in the command list `command`. This is due to the faulty conditional statement for determining whether the input value is a non-empty dictionary.

To fix this bug, we need to update the conditional statement to ensure that it accurately checks for a non-empty dictionary and then formats the values in a manner compatible with the input requirements of `spark-submit`. We also need to ensure that the values are formatted with quotation marks around them if they contain special characters.

Here is the corrected version of the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value is not None and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, val in value.items():
            formatted_val = '"{0}"'.format(val) if isinstance(val, str) and any(c in val for c in ['=', ' ']) else val
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, formatted_val)]
    return command
```
