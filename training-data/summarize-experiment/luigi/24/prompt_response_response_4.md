The potential error location within the problematic function `_dict_arg` seems to be handling the formatting of the key-value pairs for the 'conf' value inconsistently. This inconsistency can cause the test cases to fail due to the expected and actual format mismatch.

The bug occurs because the 'conf' value is not consistently formatted when adding it to the list of commands. The format should include double quotes around the key-value pair, but this formatting is not consistently applied.

To fix this bug, the `_dict_arg` function should consistently format the 'conf' value with double quotes around the key-value pair. This will ensure that the expected and actual format match, preventing test failures.

Here is the corrected code for the `_dict_arg` function:

```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]
    return command
```

The corrected code consistently formats the 'conf' value with double quotes around the key-value pair, ensuring that it matches the expected format. This corrected code can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.
