Please correct the malfunctioning function provided below by using the relevant information listed to address this bug. Then, produce a revised version of the function that resolves the issue. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
None
```

The following is the buggy function that you need to fix:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]
    return command

```

## Test Case Summary
The error message for the `test_defaults` test is indicating that the actual list returned from `proc` differs from the expected list when `proc.call_args[0][0]` is being asserted. Additionally, the message contains a specific assertion error that highlights the differences in the lists: it indicates that the first differing element between the two lists is at index 12, where the expected list contains the value "'prop1=val1'" while the actual list contains "prop1=val1".

The error message points to `test/contrib/spark_test.py` line number 165, suggesting that the assertion error occurred during this line when comparing the actual and expected values.

The associated test function `test_defaults` is defined as part of the `SparkSubmitTaskTest` class, which uses the `@with_config` and `@patch` decorators. The `@with_config` decorator sets a configuration object with different properties related to Spark, including the `spark-submit` command, `master`, and various files and archives to be used. The `@patch` decorator creates a mock object to replace `Popen` module (subprocess.Popen) so that it can be used for checking the command arguments it receives during a run.

This test calls the `TestDefaultSparkSubmitTask` and runs it, then asserts that the `proc.call_args[0][0]` matches the expected list of arguments for the spark-submit command. The expected list contains all necessary options for the spark-submit command, such as --master, --jars, --py-files, --files, --archives, --conf, and the script file "test.py".

Due to the error, it's apparent that the `proc.call_args[0][0]` does not match the expected list of arguments. The key differences are found in the `--conf` option. The expected list contains the value "'prop1=val1'" within quotes while the actual list contains "prop1=val1" without quotes.

Upon examining the erroneous code section of the test code, we can see that the error message corresponds to the assertions made in the `test_default` function, especially the `self.assertEqual` statement where the actual and expected arguments do not match up. 

This discrepancy in the `--conf` option is probably because of how the `conf` parameters are passed into `spark-submit` within the `spark` dictionaries in the `@with_config` decorator. The value inside the `dict` is converted from "'prop1=val1'" (with  quotes) to "prop1=val1" (without quotes). This is directly related to the `_dict_arg` method. The actual `dict` is being passed as the value into `_dict_arg` function's `value` parameter, and during the processing of this dict, incorrect quoting is occurring.

Further debugging and modification of the `_dict_arg` method to ensure proper processing of the input dict with the correct quoting should be done to rectify the discrepancies and ultimately solve the assertion error in the test case.
