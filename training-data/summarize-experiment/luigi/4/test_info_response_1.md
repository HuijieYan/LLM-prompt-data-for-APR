The error message provided pertains to the test function named `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` in the `contrib.redshift_test.py` module of the project. The error message is a `TypeError` that occurs when the `len()` function is called on the `self.columns` attribute of the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` object. This `len()` function is called within the `copy()` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class to construct the `colnames` string used in the execution of a SQL query.

Further context from the error message reveals that the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` object is instantiated with the `columns` attribute set to `None`, which leads to the `TypeError` when attempting to obtain the length of a `NoneType` object.

To address this issue within the `S3CopyToTable` class, the `copy()` method should be made to handle the case where the `self.columns` attribute is `None`. In the current implementation, when `self.columns` is `None`, the `colnames` variable is set to an empty string, which is not inherently erroneous. However, the subsequent use of this `colnames` string in the SQL query causes an issue because it is applied directly without considering whether `self.columns` is `None`.

Therefore, a modification to the `copy()` method's logic is necessary to conditionally construct the `colnames` String and use it in the SQL query based on the state of `self.columns`. When `self.columns` is `None`, the `colnames` should be excluded from the SQL query altogether, rather than being constructed as an empty string.

The modified `copy()` method might resemble the following:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
  
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```
In this modified implementation, the `colnames` string is only constructed when `self.columns` is not `None` and has a length greater than 0. Otherwise, `colnames` is set to an empty string. This adjustment provides a conditional handling of the `colnames` string, effectively resolving the `TypeError` issue that surfaced in the test case with `None`-typed `columns`.
