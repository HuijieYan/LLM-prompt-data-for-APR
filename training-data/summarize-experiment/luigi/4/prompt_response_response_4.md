The error in the provided buggy function occurs when the `len()` function is called on the `self.columns` attribute, which is set to `None` in the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` object. This results in a `TypeError` due to an attempt to obtain the length of a `NoneType` object.

The root cause of the bug is that the `copy()` method does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None` properly. It constructs the `colnames` string without checking the state of `self.columns`, leading to the `TypeError` when attempting to use it in the SQL query.

To fix this bug, the `copy()` method should be modified to conditionally construct the `colnames` string and use it in the SQL query based on the state of `self.columns`. When `self.columns` is `None`, the `colnames` should be excluded from the SQL query altogether, rather than being constructed as an empty string.

The modified `copy()` method that resolves this issue is as follows:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
  
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In this corrected implementation, the `colnames` string is only constructed when `self.columns` is not `None` and has a length greater than 0. Otherwise, `colnames` is set to an empty string. This provides a conditional handling of the `colnames` string, effectively resolving the `TypeError` issue that surfaced in the test case with `None`-typed `columns`.

The GitHub issue title for this bug would be "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided." The associated detailed issue description would highlight the root cause of the bug and suggest the possible solution to address it.
