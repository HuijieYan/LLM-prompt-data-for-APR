The issue in the provided buggy function is that it tries to calculate the length of the `self.columns` attribute without checking if it is `None` first. This causes a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is `None`. The buggy function is the `copy()` method in the `S3CopyToTable` class.

The reason for the bug is that the code assumes `self.columns` will always have a value and attempts to calculate its length without checking for `None` first.

To fix the bug, the `self.columns` attribute needs to be checked for `None` before attempting to calculate its length. If it's not `None`, then it should proceed with the length calculation.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy()` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
  
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In this corrected implementation, the `self.columns` attribute is checked for `None` before the length is calculated. If it's `None`, the `colnames` variable is set to an empty string, avoiding the `TypeError` issue.

The GitHub issue title for this bug could be: "Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided"

The associated detailed issue description could be:

"Running Redshift COPY jobs with columns = None to prohibit table creation fails in luigi 2.7.1 with a TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len(). The root cause seems to be in the `S3CopyToTable` class. A possible solution would be to change the line to `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` unless there is a specific reason to explicitly check for the length of `self.columns`."
