Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:  # Check if columns are not None and have length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the corrected version, a check is added to ensure that `self.columns` is not None and has length before attempting to process it. This modification will prevent the `TypeError` that occurred when `self.columns` was set to `None`. Now, if `self.columns` is None, the `colnames` variable will remain an empty string and the `COPY` command will be constructed without the column names.

This should resolve the issue and prevent the `TypeError` from occurring when the `copy` function is called with `self.columns` set to `None`, as observed in the test case.
