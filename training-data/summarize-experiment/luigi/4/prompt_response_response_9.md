The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement: 

```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is that when `self.columns` is `None`, the comparison `len(self.columns) > 0` leads to a `TypeError` because the length of `None` cannot be determined.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to add a check to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

With this fix, the `if` statement now checks if `self.columns` is not `None` before evaluating its length, preventing the `TypeError` from occurring.
