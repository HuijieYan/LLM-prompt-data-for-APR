Based on the given information, the bug in the `copy` function is caused by the `if len(self.columns) > 0` statement, which throws a TypeError when `self.columns` is set to None. To fix this, we need to handle the case when `self.columns` is None and provide a default behavior.

Here's the revised version of the function that resolves the issue:

```python
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    """
    Template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3.
    
    Usage:
    
    * Subclass and override the required attributes:
    
      * `host`,
      * `database`,
      * `user`,
      * `password`,
      * `table`,
      * `columns`,
      * `s3_load_path`.
    
    * You can also override the attributes provided by the
      CredentialsMixin if they are not supplied by your
      configuration or environment variables.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    # corrected copy function
    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # fixed condition
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

With the revised version of the function, the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0` properly handles the case when `self.columns` is None, preventing the TypeError from occurring. This fix ensures that the function behaves as intended even when `self.columns` is not explicitly provided.
