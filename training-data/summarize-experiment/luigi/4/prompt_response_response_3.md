The bug is located in the `copy` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class. The bug occurs because the `copy` method does not handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`. This results in a `TypeError` when attempting to obtain the length of a `NoneType` object.

The reason for the bug is that the `copy` method assumes that `self.columns` will always be a non-empty list, and it constructs the `colnames` string based on the assumption. When `self.columns` is `None`, the length cannot be obtained, leading to the `TypeError`.

To fix the bug, the `copy` method should be modified to conditionally construct the `colnames` string and use it in the SQL query based on the state of `self.columns`. When `self.columns` is `None`, the `colnames` should be excluded from the SQL query altogether.

The corrected code for the `copy` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
  
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This modification ensures that the `colnames` string is only constructed and used in the SQL query when `self.columns` is not `None` and has a length greater than 0. When `self.columns` is `None`, the `colnames` is set to an empty string and excluded from the SQL query, resolving the `TypeError` issue.
