The bug in the provided code is caused by the conditional statement `if len(self.columns) > 0:`. When `self.columns` is `None`, this comparison leads to a `TypeError` since the length of `None` cannot be determined.

To fix this bug, we can add a check to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` before performing the length comparison.

Here's the revised version of the function that resolves the issue:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

By adding the check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:`, we are ensuring that the comparison for length is only done when `self.columns` is not None. This resolves the `TypeError` that occurs when `self.columns` is `None`. This corrected function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
