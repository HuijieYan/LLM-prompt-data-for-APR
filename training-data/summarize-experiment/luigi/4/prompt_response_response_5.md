The issue in the provided function is that it attempts to check the length of the `self.columns` attribute without handling the case where `self.columns` is `None`. This causes a `TypeError` when the length is checked. To fix this, we need to modify the function to handle the case where `self.columns` is `None`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the revised version, we added a conditional check `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:` to ensure that the length of `self.columns` is only checked if `self.columns` is not `None`. This prevents the `TypeError` from occurring when `self.columns` is `None`.

This corrected code can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.
