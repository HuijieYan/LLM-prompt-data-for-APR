The error message is a `TypeError` that occurs when the `len()` function is called on the `self.columns` attribute of the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` object. This `len()` function is called within the `copy()` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class to construct the `colnames` string used in the execution of a SQL query.

The bug occurs in the `copy()` method of the `S3CopyToTable` class. When the `self.columns` attribute is set to `None`, a `TypeError` is raised because the `len()` function is being called on a `NoneType` object.

The bug can be fixed by adding a conditional check to only construct the `colnames` string when `self.columns` is not `None` and has a length greater than 0. Otherwise, the `colnames` string should be set to an empty string.

Here's the corrected code for the `copy()` method:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
  
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)
    else:
        colnames = ''

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

This modification ensures that the `colnames` string is only constructed when `self.columns` is not `None` and has a length greater than 0, thereby resolving the `TypeError` issue.
