The issue in the given function is that when `self.columns` is `None`, the conditional statement `if len(self.columns) > 0:` raises a TypeError because `None` does not have a length. This can be resolved by adding a check for `None` before attempting to get the length of `self.columns`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
import logging

class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    """
    Template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3.
    
    Usage:
    
    * Subclass and override the required attributes:
    
      * `host`,
      * `database`,
      * `user`,
      * `password`,
      * `table`,
      * `columns`,
      * `s3_load_path`.
    
    * You can also override the attributes provided by the
      CredentialsMixin if they are not supplied by your
      configuration or environment variables.
    """

    # ... other methods ...

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logging.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

In the corrected version, I added a check for `self.columns is not None` before checking its length in the conditional statement. This will prevent the TypeError when `self.columns` is `None`.

By using this corrected version, the bug in the original function will be resolved.
