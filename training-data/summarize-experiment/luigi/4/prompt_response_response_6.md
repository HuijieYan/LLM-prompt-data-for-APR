Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:  # check if self.columns is not None before checking its length
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

Explanation:
1. The issue was occurring because the function did not handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. We added a check for `self.columns` to ensure it is not `None` before attempting to check its length.
2. By adding the condition `if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0`, we ensure that the length of `self.columns` is only checked if it is not `None`.
3. This approach eliminates the TypeError that was occurring due to attempting to check the length of a `None` object.

With these changes, the function now handles the case when `self.columns` is `None` and ensures that the length is only checked when it is safe to do so.

This corrected code can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.
