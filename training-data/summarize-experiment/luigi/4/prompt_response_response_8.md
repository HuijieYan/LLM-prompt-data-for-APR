The error in the provided function is originating from the conditional statement `if len(self.columns) > 0:`. When `self.columns` is `None`, this comparison leads to a `TypeError` since the length of `None` cannot be determined.

To fix this bug, we need to update the conditional statement to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. This can be achieved using an `if` statement to check if `self.columns` is not `None` before checking its length.

Here's the revised version of the function that resolves the issue:

```python
import logging

class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    """
    Template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3.
    
    Usage:
    
    * Subclass and override the required attributes:
    
      * `host`,
      * `database`,
      * `user`,
      * `password`,
      * `table`,
      * `columns`,
      * `s3_load_path`.
    
    * You can also override the attributes provided by the
      CredentialsMixin if they are not supplied by your
      configuration or environment variables.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def copy(self, cursor, f):
        """
        Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

        If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
        """
        logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
        colnames = ''
        if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
            colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
            colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

        cursor.execute("""
         COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
         CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
         {options}
         ;""".format(
            table=self.table,
            colnames=colnames,
            source=f,
            creds=self._credentials(),
            options=self.copy_options)
        )
```

This revised function includes a check for `self.columns` before checking its length, and it should now handle the case when `self.columns` is `None` without raising any errors.
