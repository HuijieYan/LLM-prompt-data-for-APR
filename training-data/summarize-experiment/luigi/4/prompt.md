Please correct the malfunctioning function provided below by using the relevant information listed to address this bug. Then, produce a revised version of the function that resolves the issue. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
None
```

The following is the buggy function that you need to fix:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )

```



## Functions Used in the Buggy Function
```python# class declaration containing the buggy function
class S3CopyToTable(rdbms.CopyToTable, _CredentialsMixin):
    """
    Template task for inserting a data set into Redshift from s3.
    
    Usage:
    
    * Subclass and override the required attributes:
    
      * `host`,
      * `database`,
      * `user`,
      * `password`,
      * `table`,
      * `columns`,
      * `s3_load_path`.
    
    * You can also override the attributes provided by the
      CredentialsMixin if they are not supplied by your
      configuration or environment variables.

        pass

## Test Case Summary
The test function `test_s3_copy_with_nonetype_columns` focuses on testing the behavior of the `copy` method of the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task under specific conditions. In this test, the `columns` parameter is set to `None`, which implies that the `self.columns` attribute within the `copy` method will also be `None`.

In the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task, the `copy` method is called with specific arguments, including the `cursor` and the `path`. Within the `copy` method, the first action is to log the message "Inserting file" along with the file path. However, the critical section to focus on is the conditional statement:
```python
if len(self.columns) > 0:
```
Here, the intention seems to be checking if the `self.columns` has a length greater than 0, which would imply it is not empty. However, when `self.columns` is `None`, this comparison leads to a `TypeError` since the length of `None` cannot be determined. This directly links to the error message encountered during the test execution:
```
TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()
```
This error originates precisely from the conditional statement in the `copy` method of the `DummyS3CopyToTableKey` task, triggered due to the `self.columns` being `None` and the comparison attempting to determine its length.
Therefore, to fix the bug in the `copy` method, a check should be implemented to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`. This could be accomplished using an `if` statement or by providing a default value for `self.columns`. Additionally, the corresponding test function must be updated to verify that the `copy` method appropriately handles the scenario when `columns` is `None` without raising any errors.

# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
Redshift COPY fails in luigi 2.7.1 when columns are not provided
```

## The associated detailed issue description
```text
Running Redshift COPY jobs with columns = None to prohibit table creation fails in luigi 2.7.1 with

TypeError: object of type 'NoneType' has no len()
The root cause seems to be https://github.com/spotify/luigi/pull/2245/files#diff-778ea3db4cccaf4de6564889c5eb670fR338

A possible solution would be to change the line to

if self.columns and len(self.columns) > 0:
unless I am missing some reason to explicitly ask only for len(self.columns).
```
