The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement `if len(self.columns) > 0`. The reason for the occurrence of the bug is that when `self.columns` is `None`, trying to get the length of `None` leads to a `TypeError`.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to check whether `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. If `self.columns` is not `None`, then the length can be calculated. Otherwise, an alternative action can be taken to handle the case when `self.columns` is `None`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None and len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In this corrected code, the conditional statement has been updated to first check if `self.columns` is not `None` before attempting to get its length. If `self.columns` is not `None`, then the length is calculated and the subsequent logic is executed. Otherwise, `colnames` remains an empty string, as it was in the original code.
