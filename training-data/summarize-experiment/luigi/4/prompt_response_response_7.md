The issue with the buggy function `copy` lies in the check for the length of `self.columns`. The function fails when `self.columns` is set to `None` because it attempts to check the length of a NoneType object, resulting in a `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the function to incorporate a conditional check for the existence of `self.columns` before checking its length.

Here is the revised version of the function that resolves the issue:

```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if self.columns is not None:  # Check for existence of self.columns
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )
```

In the revised function, we first check if `self.columns` is not None before attempting to retrieve its length. This conditional check ensures that the function does not encounter a `TypeError` when `self.columns` is set to `None`.

This revised version of the function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version to address the bug related to checking the length of `self.columns`.
