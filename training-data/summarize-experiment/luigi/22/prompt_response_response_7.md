The error occurs in the `prune` method of the Worker class. The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` because the `self.last_active` is of type `NoneType` and the code is trying to perform addition with `config.worker_disconnect_delay`, which is an integer.

The bug occurs because the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` method is assigned a default value of `None`, and this value is never updated. As a result, the `last_active` remains `None`, leading to the TypeError when it is used in the `prune` method.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` parameter is always initialized to a valid value. We can accomplish this by using the current time when the `last_active` parameter is not provided.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the Worker class:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    # ... other methods ...
```

With this change, we ensure that if the `last_active` is not provided, it defaults to the current time, thus avoiding the `NoneType` error when the `prune` method is called. This corrected code can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.
