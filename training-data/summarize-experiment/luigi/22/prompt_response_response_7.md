The error occurs because the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default and then used in a comparison with an integer value in the `prune()` method. This results in a TypeError because you cannot add an integer to `None`. 

To fix this issue, you can provide a default value for `last_active` that represents the time when the worker was last active. This default value can be set to the current time when the worker is initialized if no value is provided for `last_active`.

Here's the revised version of the function that resolves the issue:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By modifying the `__init__` function in this way, the `last_active` parameter will default to the current time if no value is provided, avoiding the TypeError when used in the `prune()` method.

This fix addresses the bug by ensuring that the `last_active` parameter is always initialized with a valid value.
