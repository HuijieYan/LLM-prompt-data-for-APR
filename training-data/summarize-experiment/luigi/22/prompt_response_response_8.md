The error occurs because the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default, and when the `prune` method is called, it attempts to add the `None` value to an integer (`config.worker_disconnect_delay`) using the `+` operator.

To fix this bug, we need to check if `last_active` is not `None` before performing the addition. If it is `None`, we can assume that the worker has never been active and use the `started` time as the last active time.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

With this correction, if `last_active` is not provided during the creation of a Worker instance, it will default to the current time, preventing the `None` value error when calling the `prune` method.
