The bug occurs because the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default in the `__init__` method, and when the `prune` method is called in the test, it tries to add an integer to `None`, resulting in a `TypeError`.

To fix this issue, we need to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` and set a default value for it when it's not provided.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=0):  # Set a default value of 0 for last_active
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    # Other methods of the Worker class...

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform pruning actions
            pass
```

This revised version initializes the `last_active` parameter to 0 if it is not provided, avoiding the `TypeError` when adding an integer to `None`.
