The bug occurs in the method `prune` of the `Worker` class, where it attempts to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to the `self.last_active` attribute. The error indicates that `self.last_active` is of type `NoneType`, causing an unsupported operand error when trying to add an integer to it.

The root cause of the bug is that the `last_active` parameter defaults to `None` in the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class. When the `prune` method tries to perform arithmetic operations on `self.last_active`, which could potentially be `None`, it results in a type error.

To fix the bug, we should modify the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` by providing a default value. We can set `self.last_active` to a default value of 0 if `last_active` is `None`, ensuring that it is always an integer and can participate in arithmetic operations.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    # Set self.last_active to zero if last_active is None
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = 0
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

With this modification, the `last_active` attribute of the `Worker` object will always have a meaningful value, preventing the type error when performing arithmetic operations in the `prune` method.
