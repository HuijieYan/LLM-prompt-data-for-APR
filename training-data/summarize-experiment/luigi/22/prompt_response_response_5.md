The error occurs because the `last_active` parameter has a default value of `None`, which causes a TypeError when trying to add it to an integer in the `prune` method. To fix this bug, we need to check if the `last_active` parameter is None before adding it to the `config.worker_disconnect_delay`.

Here's the revised version of the function that resolves the issue:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # prune the worker and perform any necessary clean up
            pass
```

With this revision, the `last_active` parameter defaults to the current time if it is None, avoiding the TypeError when trying to add None to an integer. This should resolve the issue and allow the `prune` method to work as expected.
