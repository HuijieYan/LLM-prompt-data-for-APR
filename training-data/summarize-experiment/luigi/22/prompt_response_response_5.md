The bug occurs because the `last_active` parameter is set to `None` by default, and then it is being used in a comparison with `config.worker_disconnect_delay` in the `prune` method. This results in a TypeError when trying to add `None` with an integer.

To fix this, we can check if `last_active` is None and set it to the current time if it is. This will ensure that `last_active` always has a valid value and the comparison in the `prune` method will work without any issues.

Here's the corrected code for the `Worker` class:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # prune the worker
            pass
```

With this fix, the `last_active` parameter will always have a valid value and the comparison in the `prune` method will work as expected. This corrected code can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.
