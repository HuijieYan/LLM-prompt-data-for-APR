Please correct the malfunctioning function provided below by using the relevant information listed to address this bug. Then, produce a revised version of the function that resolves the issue. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
import time
```

The following is the buggy function that you need to fix:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```



## Functions Used in the Buggy Function
```python# class declaration containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


```



The followings are test functions under directory `test/scheduler_test.py` in the project.
```python
def test_worker_prune_after_init(self):
    worker = luigi.scheduler.Worker(123)

    class TmpCfg:
        def __init__(self):
            self.worker_disconnect_delay = 10

    worker.prune(TmpCfg())
```

The error message that corresponds the the above test functions is:
```
self = <scheduler_test.SchedulerTest testMethod=test_worker_prune_after_init>

    def test_worker_prune_after_init(self):
        worker = luigi.scheduler.Worker(123)
    
        class TmpCfg:
            def __init__(self):
                self.worker_disconnect_delay = 10
