Please correct the malfunctioning function provided below by using the relevant information listed to address this bug. Then, produce a revised version of the function that resolves the issue. When outputting the fix, output the entire function so that the output can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.

Assume that the following list of imports are available in the current environment, so you don't need to import them when generating a fix.
```python
import time
```

The following is the buggy function that you need to fix:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}

```



## Functions Used in the Buggy Function
```python# class declaration containing the buggy function
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...


```



## Test Functions and Error Messages Summary
The followings are test functions under directory `test/scheduler_test.py` in the project.
```python
def test_worker_prune_after_init(self):
    worker = luigi.scheduler.Worker(123)

    class TmpCfg:
        def __init__(self):
            self.worker_disconnect_delay = 10

    worker.prune(TmpCfg())
```

Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:
The error message is pointing to the `prune` method of the `luigi.scheduler.Worker` class, saying unsupported operand types for `+`, specifically a 'NoneType' and an 'int'. It also references the line of code in the `prune` method causing the error, indicating that `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time()`. 

The `test_worker_prune_after_init` test function attempts to create a `luigi.scheduler.Worker` object with `worker_id` 123 and then calls the `prune` method on that worker, passing in a `TmpCfg` object. 

The `prune` method attempts to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to the `self.last_active` attribute of the `Worker` class in the condition `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time()`. The error indicates that `self.last_active` is of type `NoneType`, which is incompatible with an integer in the addition operation. 

Upon examining the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class, it's evident that `self.last_active` is initialized as the `last_active` argument to `__init__`, which defaults to `None`. This information points to the cause of the error. The `self.last_active` attribute of the `Worker` object causing the error has not been initialized to a meaningful value.

To resolve this issue, the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class should be updated to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` by providing a default value. This can be achieved by modifying the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    # Set self.last_active to zero if last_active is None
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = 0
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

By setting `self.last_active` to a default value of 0 when `last_active` is `None`, the addition operation in the `prune` method will not result in a TypeError.



## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

From the provided code snippet, it appears that the `__init__` function initializes various attributes of a `Worker` object. The `worker_id` is assigned to the `id` attribute, `last_active` is assigned to the `last_active` attribute, and the `started` attribute is set to the current time using `time.time()`. Additionally, `tasks` is initialized as an empty set, and `info` is initialized as an empty dictionary.

In the first buggy case, the input parameter `worker_id` has a value of `123` and a type of `int`. The `last_active` parameter has a value of `1702321538.4872892` and a type of `float`. When examining the variables at the moment before the function returns, we observe that `self.id` has a value of `123` and a type of `int`, `self.last_active` has a value of `1702321538.4872892` and a type of `float`, `self.started` has a value of `1702321538.50115` and a type of `float`, `self.tasks` has a value of an empty set, and `self.info` has a value of an empty dictionary.

Based on the observed input and output values, it appears that the `__init__` function is correctly assigning the `worker_id` and `last_active` parameters to the `id` and `last_active` attributes, respectively. Additionally, the `started` attribute is correctly being initialized with the current time, and the `tasks` and `info` attributes are being initialized as an empty set and dictionary, respectively.

However, it's important to note that the discrepancy in the `self.started` variable value between the input and output may indicate a potential issue with the function's initialization of this attribute. Further investigation into the manner in which `time.time()` is being used to set the `started` attribute may be necessary to identify and address any potential bugs or inaccuracies in the function's behavior.



## Summary of Expected Parameters and Return Values in the Buggy Function

Summary:
The function is an initialization method for a Worker object. It takes in a worker_id and last_active (which defaults to None) as input parameters. Within the function, it sets the id of the Worker to the provided worker_id, sets the reference to None, initializes last_active to the provided value (or None), sets the started time using the time.time() function, initializes the tasks to an empty set, and sets info to an empty dictionary. The function returns None as it is an __init__ method and is used for object initialization.

The expected variable values and types before the function return for a specific test case are in line with the core logic of the code. The function sets the attributes of the Worker object according to the provided input parameters and default values.
