The error occurs in the `prune()` function of the `Worker` class. The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` because the addition operation is being performed on a `NoneType` and an `int` in the line `if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():`.

The reason for this error is that the `last_active` parameter is set to `None`, causing the addition operation with `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to fail.

To fix this bug, we need to handle the case when `last_active` is `None` and set it to the current time when `last_active` is not provided.

Here's the corrected code for the `prune()` function:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```
