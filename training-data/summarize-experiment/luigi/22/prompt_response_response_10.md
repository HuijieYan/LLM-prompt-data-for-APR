The error in the provided function stems from the fact that the `last_active` parameter, if not provided, defaults to `None`. This causes a TypeError when attempting to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `self.last_active` in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class. 

To fix this bug, we can modify the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` by providing a default value of 0.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        # Set self.last_active to zero if last_active is None
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = 0
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

By setting `self.last_active` to a default value of 0 when `last_active` is `None`, the addition operation in the `prune` method will not result in a TypeError. This updated code resolves the bug and ensures that the `last_active` attribute is always initialized to a meaningful value, preventing any potential issues in the `prune` method or other parts of the code that rely on it.
