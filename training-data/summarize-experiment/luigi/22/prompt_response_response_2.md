The bug in the provided function is due to the default initialization of the `last_active` attribute as `None`. This causes issues when performing an addition operation involving `None` and an integer, leading to a TypeError.

To fix this bug, `__init__` method of the `Worker` class should be updated to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` by providing a default value. This can be achieved by modifying the `__init__` method:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """
    
    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        # Set self.last_active to zero if last_active is None
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = 0
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

By setting `self.last_active` to a default value of 0 when `last_active` is `None`, the addition operation in the `prune` method will not result in a TypeError.

This corrected code can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.
