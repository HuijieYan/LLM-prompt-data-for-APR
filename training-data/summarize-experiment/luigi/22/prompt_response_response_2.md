The error occurs in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class, where the addition operation is being performed between `NoneType` and `int` types.

The bug occurs because the `last_active` parameter has a default value of `None` in the `__init__` method, and it is not handled correctly in the `prune` method.

To fix the bug, we need to check if the `last_active` parameter is `None` before performing the addition operation in the `prune` method. If it is `None`, we should handle it appropriately.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

Now, with the fixed `__init__` method, the `last_active` parameter will default to the current time if it is not provided.

This will prevent `last_active` from being `None`, therefore fixing the bug in the `prune` method.

With this correction, the `prune` method should work correctly and the addition operation will not raise a `TypeError`.
