The error is occurring in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class. The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError` because the `last_active` attribute is `None` and it is trying to perform an operation with an `int` (config.worker_disconnect_delay) and a `NoneType`. This is happening because the `last_active` attribute is not being initialized properly when the Worker object is created.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the `last_active` attribute is properly initialized, either with the provided value or with the current time when no value is provided.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        if last_active is not None:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        else:
            self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch if last_active is not provided
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` attribute is properly initialized with the current time if no value is provided. This should resolve the `TypeError` issue in the `prune` method.
