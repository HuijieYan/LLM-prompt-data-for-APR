The error occurs in the `prune()` method of the `Worker` class when trying to compare `self.last_active` with `time.time()` and encountering a `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: 'NoneType' and 'int'`.

The reason behind this bug is that the `last_active` parameter in the `__init__` function is initialized with a default value of `None`. When the `prune()` method is called and tries to compare `self.last_active` (which is `None`) with `config.worker_disconnect_delay`, it results in a `TypeError` because you cannot perform arithmetic operations with a `None` type.

To fix this bug, you need to initialize `last_active` with the current time in seconds if it is not provided. This will ensure that `last_active` is always a valid numeric value representing the seconds since epoch.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` parameter is initialized with the current time if it is not provided, ensuring that it is always a valid numeric value. This will resolve the `TypeError` when comparing `self.last_active` with `config.worker_disconnect_delay` in the `prune()` method.
