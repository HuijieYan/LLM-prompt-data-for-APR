The error occurs in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class. This is because the `last_active` parameter has a default value of `None`, and the code attempts to perform an addition operation with it. This results in a `TypeError` when the `prune` method is called.

To fix this issue, we need to check if `last_active` is `None` and handle it appropriately before performing the addition operation.

Here's the corrected code for the `Worker` class:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    def prune(self, config):
        # Delete workers that haven't said anything for a while (probably killed)
        if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():
            # Perform the pruning operation
            pass  # Placeholder for the actual pruning logic
```

With this modification, the `last_active` parameter is checked for `None` and assigned the current time using `time.time()` if it is `None`. This ensures that the addition operation in the `prune` method does not encounter a `NoneType` and `int` operand error.
