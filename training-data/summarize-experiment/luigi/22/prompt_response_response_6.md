The error occurs when the `prune` method is called on the `Worker` object, and it tries to perform an operation with a `NoneType` and an `int`. This is because the `last_active` attribute is initialized as `None` in the buggy function, and it is used in the `prune` method without being properly handled for the `None` case.

To fix this issue, we need to initialize the `last_active` attribute differently.

Here is the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    # ... omitted code ...

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch if not provided
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` attribute is set to the current time if it is not provided when the `Worker` object is instantiated. This ensures that it will always have a valid value when used in the `prune` method.

The `Worker` class with the corrected `__init__` method can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version in the codebase.
