The error message indicates a TypeError, specifically stating that the operation "+" is not supported between a 'NoneType' and an 'int'. This points to the line in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class where the `last_active` attribute is being used in a comparison with the `worker_disconnect_delay` value from the configuration.

The issue arises because the `last_active` attribute is set to a default value of `None` in the `__init__` function, and the comparison in the `prune` method does not handle this case.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `__init__` function to ensure that `last_active` is set to the current time if no `last_active` value is provided when creating a new Worker object.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this modification, the `last_active` attribute will be set to the current time if no value is provided when creating a new Worker object.

This should address the bug and prevent the TypeError from occurring in the `prune` method.
