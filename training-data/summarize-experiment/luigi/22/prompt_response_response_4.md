The error occurs due to the `last_active` variable being set to `None` by default and then used in an arithmetic operation. To fix this, we need to check if `last_active` is `None` before performing the calculation. If it is `None`, we can set it to the current time. 

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` function:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

By adding a check for `last_active` and setting it to the current time if it is `None`, we ensure that the arithmetic operation in the `prune` function will always have a valid value to work with.

This corrected code can be used as a drop-in replacement for the previous buggy version of the function.
