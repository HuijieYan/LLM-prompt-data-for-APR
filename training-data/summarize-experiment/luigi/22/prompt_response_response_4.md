The error in the provided buggy function is likely due to the `last_active` attribute being initialized as `None` if no value is provided. This leads to the unsupported operand types error when attempting to use `self.last_active` in a mathematical operation.

To address this issue, we can modify the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` by providing a default value of 0. This can be achieved using a simple conditional statement within the `__init__` method.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        # Set self.last_active to zero if last_active is None
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = 0
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

With this modification, the `last_active` attribute will default to 0 if no value is provided, preventing the unsupported operand types error when performing operations involving this attribute. The revised function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
