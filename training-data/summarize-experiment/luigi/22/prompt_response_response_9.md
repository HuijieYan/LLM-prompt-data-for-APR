Based on the given information, the bug in the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class is due to the `last_active` attribute defaulting to `None` when `last_active` is not provided as an argument. This results in a TypeError when the `last_active` attribute is used in the `prune` method's condition.

To fix the bug, the `__init__` method should be updated to provide a default value of 0 for the `last_active` attribute when `last_active` is not explicitly provided. This can be achieved by using a conditional statement within the `__init__` method to check if `last_active` is `None`, and if so, setting `last_active` to 0.

Here is the corrected `__init__` method for the `Worker` class:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None
        # Set self.last_active to zero if last_active is None
        if last_active is None:
            self.last_active = 0
        else:
            self.last_active = last_active
        self.started = time.time()
        self.tasks = set()
        self.info = {}
```

With this correction, the `__init__` method will handle the case where `last_active` is not provided, ensuring that the `last_active` attribute is always initialized to a meaningful value before it is used in other methods of the `Worker` class. This fix addresses the bug and prevents the TypeError encountered in the `prune` method when using the `last_active` attribute.
