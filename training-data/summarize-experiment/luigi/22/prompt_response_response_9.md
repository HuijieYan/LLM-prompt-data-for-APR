The error message indicates that there is a TypeError because the addition operation is being performed on a NoneType and an int. This suggests that the last_active variable is not being properly initialized, and the addition operation is failing due to the NoneType value.

To fix this issue, we need to ensure that the last_active variable is properly initialized with a default value if it is not provided. We can use the value of time.time() as the default value for last_active if it is not provided.

Here's the corrected code for the __init__ function:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By using the conditional expression `last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()`, we ensure that the last_active variable is initialized with a valid value, either the provided last_active value or the current time if last_active is not provided. This should resolve the TypeError issue when using the Worker class.
