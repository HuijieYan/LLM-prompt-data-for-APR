The error message indicates a `TypeError` caused by attempting to add a `NoneType` and an `int` together. This is likely due to the `last_active` variable being set to `None` by default, and then trying to perform arithmetic operations on it.

To fix this, we need to assign the value of `time.time()` to `last_active` if no value is provided, rather than leaving it as `None`. This will ensure that the variable always holds a valid timestamp.

Here's the corrected code for the `Worker` class with the `__init__` function fixed:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}

    # ... other methods ...
```

This revised version ensures that `last_active` is always initialized to a valid timestamp, preventing any `NoneType` related errors during arithmetic operations.
