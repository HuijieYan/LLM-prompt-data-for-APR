The error message is pointing to the `prune` method of the `luigi.scheduler.Worker` class, saying unsupported operand types for `+`, specifically a 'NoneType' and an 'int'. It also references the line of code in the `prune` method causing the error, indicating that `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time()`. 

The `test_worker_prune_after_init` test function attempts to create a `luigi.scheduler.Worker` object with `worker_id` 123 and then calls the `prune` method on that worker, passing in a `TmpCfg` object. 

The `prune` method attempts to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to the `self.last_active` attribute of the `Worker` class in the condition `self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time()`. The error indicates that `self.last_active` is of type `NoneType`, which is incompatible with an integer in the addition operation. 

Upon examining the `__init__` function of the `Worker` class, it's evident that `self.last_active` is initialized as the `last_active` argument to `__init__`, which defaults to `None`. This information points to the cause of the error. The `self.last_active` attribute of the `Worker` object causing the error has not been initialized to a meaningful value.

To resolve this issue, the `__init__` method of the `Worker` class should be updated to handle the case where `last_active` is `None` by providing a default value. This can be achieved by modifying the `__init__` method:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None
    # Set self.last_active to zero if last_active is None
    if last_active is None:
        self.last_active = 0
    else:
        self.last_active = last_active
    self.started = time.time()
    self.tasks = set()
    self.info = {}
```

By setting `self.last_active` to a default value of 0 when `last_active` is `None`, the addition operation in the `prune` method will not result in a TypeError.
