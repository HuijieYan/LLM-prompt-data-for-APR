The error message indicates that the code is trying to add an integer to a value of type NoneType, resulting in a TypeError. This error occurs in the `prune` method of the Worker class.

The reason behind this bug is that the `last_active` attribute is initialized as None when no value is provided, and the code does not account for this possibility when using the attribute in the `prune` method.

To fix the bug, we need to check if `last_active` is None, and if so, handle it appropriately in the `prune` method. We can set `last_active` to the current time if it is None, and then proceed with the comparison.

Here is the corrected code for the `__init__` method of the Worker class:

```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    if last_active is not None:
        self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    else:
        self.last_active = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}
```

With this fix, the `last_active` attribute is initialized to the current time if no value is provided, ensuring that it is always of type float when used in the `prune` method.

This revised code can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the `__init__` method in the Worker class.
