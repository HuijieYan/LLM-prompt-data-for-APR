The error occurs when the `prune` method of the `Worker` class is called, as it tries to add a `NoneType` and an `int` in this line `if self.last_active + config.worker_disconnect_delay < time.time():`. 

This happens because the `last_active` attribute is set to `None` by default, and the comparison is trying to add `None` with an `int`, which is causing the `TypeError`.

To fix this bug, we can modify the `__init__` method to handle the `last_active` attribute appropriately by providing a default value for it.

Here's the corrected code for the `__init__` method:

```python
class Worker(object):
    """
    Structure for tracking worker activity and keeping their references.
    """

    def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
        self.id = worker_id
        self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
        self.last_active = last_active if last_active is not None else time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
        self.tasks = set()  # task objects
        self.info = {}
```

By using the default value of `time.time()` for `last_active` when it is not provided, the comparison in the `prune` method will no longer cause a `TypeError`.

This should resolve the bug and ensure that the `prune` method functions as expected.
