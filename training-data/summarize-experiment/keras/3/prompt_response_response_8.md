The provided function, `_clone_functional_model`, is responsible for cloning a functional `Model` instance. However, there are issues in the code that need to be addressed in order to resolve the bug.

Based on the test case `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs`, the error message indicates that the assertion `assert x in tensor_map` failed, which means there is a missing output tensor in the `tensor_map`. This signifies a problem in how the output tensors are computed and mapped during the cloning process.

The potential error location within the code is the process of iterating through the nodes of the reference model and creating corresponding layers in the cloned model. Additionally, there might be issues related to the handling of complex layers such as `SwapLayer`.

The reason behind the occurrence of the bug is likely related to the computation and mapping of output tensors, especially when dealing with complex layers and multiple inputs/outputs.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to carefully analyze and adjust the section of code responsible for handling complex layers and mapping output tensors during the cloning process. This involves ensuring that all input and output tensors of complex layers are properly computed, mapped, and integrated into the `tensor_map`.

Here is the corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function that addresses the bug:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)

        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

        input_tensors = _input_tensors

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  

    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]

                    continue

            for x in reference_input_tensors:
                if x in tensor_map:

                if has_arg(layer.call, 'mask') and 'mask' not in kwargs:
                    kwargs['mask'] = computed_masks

```

The revised version of the function addresses the issues related to the computation and mapping of output tensors during the cloning process, ensuring that all input and output tensors of complex layers are properly computed, mapped, and integrated into the `tensor_map`.

This corrected function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version to resolve the issue associated with the `clone_functional_model` function.
