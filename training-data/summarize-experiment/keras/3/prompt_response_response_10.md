The buggy function `_clone_functional_model` involves cloning a functional `Model` instance and creating new layers with new weights, instead of sharing the weights of the existing layers. The function contains several conditional branches that handle cases where input tensors are provided or need to be created as placeholders.

The error seems to occur when the function tries to compute the output tensors of the model while instantiating a new model from inputs and outputs. Specifically, the assertion `assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)` indicates that the output tensor could not be found in the `tensor_map`.

The potential error location within the function is likely in the logic that populates the `tensor_map` with the correct input and output tensors. There may be issues with how the input and output tensors are being processed during the model cloning process, leading to the inability to compute specific output tensors.

The reasons behind the bug could stem from mismatches in input and output tensors, incorrect instantiation or mapping of layers, or issues with the specifics of the model's topology and tensor flow during the cloning process. There may also be factors related to the creation and processing of input placeholders and the mapping of input and output tensors.

To fix the bug, it's crucial to thoroughly review and potentially revise the logic for creating placeholders, mapping input and output tensors, and instantiating new layers. Additionally, it may be necessary to enhance the handling of the input and output tensors and ensure that the tensor_map accurately tracks the correspondence between reference and new tensors throughout the cloning process.

Below is the revised version of the function `_clone_functional_model` that addresses the bug and includes the necessary fixes:

```python

    except that it creates new layers (and thus new weights) instead
    of sharing the weights of the existing layers.

        model: Instance of `Model`.
        input_tensors: optional list of input tensors
            to build the model upon. If not provided,
            placeholders will be created.

    # Returns
        An instance of `Model` reproducing the behavior
        of the original model, on top of new inputs tensors,
        using newly instantiated weights.

    # Raises
        ValueError: in case of invalid `model` argument value.
