## Test Functions and Error Messages Summary
The followings are test functions under directory `tests/keras/test_sequential_model.py` in the project.
```python
def test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs():
    input_layer = keras.Input(shape=(4,))

    # Layer with single input and multiple outputs
    layer1 = keras.layers.Lambda(lambda x: [x + 1, x],
                                 lambda shapes: [shapes, shapes])
    x_a, x_b = layer1(input_layer)

    class SwapLayer(keras.layers.Layer):
        def call(self, inputs, **kwargs):
            return [inputs[1], inputs[0]]

        def compute_output_shape(self, input_shape):
            return [input_shape[1], input_shape[0]]

    # Layer with multiple inputs and outputs
    x_a, x_b = SwapLayer()([x_a, x_b])
    model = keras.Model(inputs=[input_layer], outputs=[x_a, x_b])
    new_model = keras.models.clone_model(model)

    x_test = np.random.random((10, 4))
    pred_a, pred_b = model.predict(x_test)
    pred_new_a, pred_new_b = new_model.predict(x_test)
    assert(pred_a.all() == pred_new_a.all())
    assert(pred_b.all() == pred_new_b.all())
```

Here is a summary of the test cases and error messages:
The error message is pointing to a failure in the `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs` test function, specifically in the call to `keras.models.clone_model(model)`.

Upon inspecting the implementation of the `_clone_functional_model` function, there are two key points of interest that relate to the error message:

1. Checking Input Model Type:
The `_clone_functional_model` function starts by checking whether the `model` argument is an instance of the `Model` class. If it is not, a `ValueError` is raised. This check is performed using the `isinstance(model, Model)` statement, which indicates that it expects the `model` argument to be an instance of the `Model` class.

2. Iterating through Model Nodes:
Within the `_clone_functional_model` function, there is a section that iterates through the nodes of the reference model in order to clone the layers and build a new model based on the input tensors. At the end of the iteration, the function checks that the model outputs have been computed properly. If an output tensor is not found in the `tensor_map`, an assertion error is raised with the message "Could not compute output" followed by the tensor value that could not be computed.

From the test function, the `model` that is being passed to `keras.models.clone_model` is created using `keras.Model`. This model involves the use of a Lambda layer and a custom `SwapLayer`.

Now, examining the specific error message, it states:
```
E           AssertionError: Could not compute output Tensor("swap_layer_1/Identity:0", shape=(?, 4), dtype=float32)
```
This means that the function was unable to compute the output for the given tensor, which represents the swap operation performed by the `SwapLayer` defined in the test function.

In conclusion, the error is related to the `SwapLayer` and how its output is being handled during the model cloning process. The specific conditions under which the output of the `SwapLayer` is being processed within the `_clone_functional_model` function might be causing the failure. Investigating the handling of the `SwapLayer` within the model cloning process would be an appropriate next step for debugging and resolving the issue.



## Summary of Runtime Variables and Types in the Buggy Function

The given function is meant to clone a `Model` instance, creating new layers and weights instead of sharing the ones from the original model. It goes through the input model, creates placeholders if needed, and then iterates over every node in the model, creating and linking new layers. Finally, it checks that it computed the model outputs correctly and returns a new model.

Upon reviewing the logs, one issue stands out. The `layer_map` dictionary contains the mapping between original layers and their cloned counterparts. However, in the variable runtime values, we observe that the `layer.name` value is `'swap_layer_1'`, while the `newly_created_input_layer` value is `<keras.engine.input_layer.InputLayer object at 0x128e68d90>`. This suggests that the mapping in `layer_map` is incomplete or incorrect, which could lead to issues in the subsequent steps of the function.

Additionally, we can see that there is an assertion checking the existence of computed outputs for the model. If any of the model's output tensors are not present in the `tensor_map`, the function raises an assertion error. This means that if any output tensor is not correctly computed and added to the `tensor_map`, it would cause the function to fail.

From the specific case's input type and value logs, it's evident that the function didn't work as expected when attempting to clone the model. The critical point to debug would be the mapping of layers in the `layer_map` and how the `tensor_map` is updated in each iteration. By thoroughly examining the part of the function that handles layer creation and the `tensor_map` updates, the exact issue causing the failure can be identified and resolved.



## Summary of the GitHub Issue Related to the Bug

Summary:
The bug reported on GitHub revolves around the usage of `clone_model()` in conjunction with `multi_gpu_model` and `cpu_relocation=True` in Keras. The issue is observed when trying to use the script provided, resulting in an `AssertionError: Could not compute output Tensor` being raised. The bug appears to be related to the handling of output masks in the `clone_model()` method, impacting layers with multiple outputs and lacking support for masks. The bug has been replicated in the Keras version 2.2.4 and TensorFlow version 1.12.0 on multiple GPU configurations (GTX1080tis and GTX1060MQ).

The issue is further explained by highlighting the specific lines of code within the Keras library that are impacted, indicating that the `Lambda` layer's lack of support for using masks appears to contribute to the error. The user expresses gratitude and admiration for the Keras framework while providing valuable insights into the potential source of the bug.

This comprehensive summary of the GitHub issue provides a clear understanding of the bug, its reproduction, associated environment, and key insights into the potential causes, thereby facilitating a more efficient debugging process.
