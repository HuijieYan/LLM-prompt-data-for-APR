Upon analyzing the test function and the error message, it's evident that the error occurs when trying to clone a model that involves a `SwapLayer` with multiple inputs and outputs. The specific error message indicates that the function was unable to compute the output for the `SwapLayer`, which suggests a problem in handling layers with multiple outputs during the model cloning process.

The potential error location within the _clone_functional_model function lies in the section where it iterates through the nodes of the reference model to clone the layers and build a new model based on the input tensors. The issue could stem from how the output tensors of layers with multiple outputs are processed and added to the tensor_map.

The bug occurs due to insufficient support for handling layers with multiple outputs and masks during the model cloning process, leading to an assertion error when attempting to compute the output for the `SwapLayer`.

To fix the bug, it is necessary to enhance the handling of layers with multiple outputs and masks within the _clone_functional_model function. This could involve updating the tensor_map appropriately for layers with multiple outputs and ensuring that the computation and mapping of output tensors are carried out accurately.

Below is the corrected code for the _clone_functional_model function:

The corrected code addresses the issues related to handling layers with multiple outputs and masks, ensuring that the computation and mapping of output tensors are carried out accurately during the model cloning process. This updated function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version.
