From the provided logs, it looks like the buggy function `_clone_functional_model` is encountering issues with the creation and mapping of layers and tensors. Let's break down the key observations from the variables and try to understand how they relate to the function's code.

1. `model` is an instance of `Model` with specific input layers (`model._input_layers`), nodes by depth (`model._nodes_by_depth`), inputs (`model.inputs`), and outputs (`model.outputs`).

2. In the function, a dictionary `layer_map` and a dictionary `tensor_map` are instantiated to cache layers and map reference tensors to corresponding tensors and masks, respectively. These mappings are used to create the new model.

3. At a certain point in the function, the `input_tensors` are either specified as an optional parameter or created as new input placeholders.

4. The code then iterates over the nodes of the model, gets or creates new layers, gathers input and output tensors, calls the new layers, and updates the `tensor_map` accordingly.

5. The function asserts that it has computed the model outputs correctly before instantiating a new model.

Now, let's match these observations with the actual code and see where the issues might arise.

- The function initially checks if the input `model` is of the correct type and raises a `ValueError` if it's a `Sequential` model instead of a `Model` instance. This guards against incorrect input types.

- It then proceeds to create or ensure the input tensors are of the correct type and map them to the corresponding tensors in the reference model, as observed in the code. This is where the `input_tensors`, `input_layers`, and `tensor_map` values come into play, and it seems that the input shape and type transformations are causing issues with the layer and tensor mappings.

- The code iterates over the model's nodes and existing layers, however, a potential issue might arise here if the layers are not correctly instantiated or if the input and output tensors are not correctly mapped or computed.

- Finally, the function checks and asserts the correctness of the output tensors before creating the new model.

Based on the observed variables and types at runtime, it seems like there might be issues with the proper creation and mapping of input tensors and layers. The discrepancies in the input and output tensors, as well as the creation of new layers, might be causing the function to return incorrect results.

To further diagnose and fix the issues, a closer examination of how the input layers, nodes, and tensors are being processed in the function would be necessary. Additionally, careful attention to any potential mismatches in shapes and types of input/output tensors and layers will be crucial for identifying and resolving the bugs.
