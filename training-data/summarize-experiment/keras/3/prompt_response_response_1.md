Since the provided function `_clone_functional_model` is a complex function with multiple interconnected parts, the error could originate from various sections of the function. It might be related to how the `SwapLayer` is handled, how the `layer_map` and `tensor_map` are updated, or how the model outputs are computed and checked.

The test case `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs` creates a model with a Lambda layer and a `SwapLayer`, resulting in multiple outputs. The error message indicates that the output tensor from the `SwapLayer` was not computed, leading to the assertion failure. This suggests that the `SwapLayer` processing within the `_clone_functional_model` function is a potential source of the bug.

The issue might be caused by the complex nature of the `SwapLayer` and its handling during the model cloning process. Additionally, the code might not be handling multiple outputs or custom layers (like `SwapLayer`) properly in the cloning process, leading to the failure.

To resolve the bug, potential approaches include:
- Reviewing the handling of custom layers with multiple outputs within the model cloning process.
- Ensuring that the `layer_map` and `tensor_map` are updated correctly for custom layers and multiple outputs during the cloning process.
- Verifying that the model outputs are computed and added to the `tensor_map` appropriately to prevent assertion failures.

The revised version of the `_clone_functional_model` function resolves the potential bug by updating the handling of multiple outputs, custom layers, and the `layer_map` and `tensor_map` as follows:

```python

        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)

        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

        input_tensors = _input_tensors

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    for layer in model.layers:
        new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
        layer_map[layer] = new_layer
