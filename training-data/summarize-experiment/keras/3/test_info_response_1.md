From the given source code and error messages, we can discern that there is an issue with the `clone_functional_model` function within the `keras/models.py` file. The error message originates from the test function `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs` within the `test_sequential_model.py` file.

The purpose of the `clone_functional_model` function is to create a new instance of the `Model` class by cloning the functional model. The error message indicates that the assertion `assert x in tensor_map` failed, citing a specific output tensor `Tensor("swap_layer_1/Identity:0", shape=(?, 4), dtype=float32)` which could not be computed.

In order to understand this error, we need to analyze the code in the `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs` function and the structure of the functional model being used.

Looking at the test function, it involves creating a functional model with multiple inputs and outputs, using layers like `Lambda` and `SwapLayer`. It asserts that the output of the cloned model is equal to the original model for given input data. The error occurs when the `clone_model` function is called on the `model`.

The error messages instantly reveal that the issue arises from the `clone_model` function calling the `_clone_functional_model` function. Within the `_clone_functional_model` function, there are multiple stages involved such as caching created layers, mapping input tensors, iterating through the reference model nodes, and creating the corresponding layers in the cloned model.

From the error message, the specific output tensor `Tensor("swap_layer_1/Identity:0", shape=(?, 4), dtype=float32)` indicates that there might be an issue with the `SwapLayer` and its output being properly computed or mapped with the `tensor_map`.

The failure of the assertion `assert x in tensor_map` means that there is a missing output tensor i.e., it was not properly computed or mapped during the process of cloning the model.

To effectively diagnose and resolve the issue, we need to carefully examine the following:
1. The creation and computation of the layers in the functional model, especially the ones with multiple inputs/outputs and custom behavior such as the `Lambda` and `SwapLayer`.
2. The caching and mapping of the input and output tensors in the `_clone_functional_model` function.
3. The process of iterating through the nodes of the reference model and creating corresponding layers in the cloned model.
4. The specific handling of complex layers such as `SwapLayer`, ensuring that their input and output tensors are properly considered and mapped during the cloning process.

By understanding and debugging these specific sections, we can identify the root cause of the error and introduce the necessary corrections to ensure the successful clone of the functional model.
