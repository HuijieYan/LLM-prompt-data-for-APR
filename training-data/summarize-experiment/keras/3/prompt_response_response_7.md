Based on the error messages, test case, and runtime variables, it appears that the issue lies in the _clone_functional_model function within the keras.models.py file. The error message specifically points to a failing assertion where a specific output tensor could not be computed. This indicates that there may be an issue with the computation and mapping of output tensors during the cloning process.

The potential error location within the _clone_functional_model function could be related to the iteration over nodes in the reference model and the computation of corresponding output tensors. Additionally, the instantiation of the new model from inputs and outputs might also be a potential source of the issue.

The occurrence of the bug may be due to the complex behavior of certain layers (e.g., Lambda and SwapLayer) within the functional model, which may not be fully supported during the cloning process. This can result in output tensors not being properly computed or mapped, leading to assertion failures.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Ensuring that the computation and mapping of output tensors are handled correctly, especially for complex layers with multiple outputs.
2. Verifying that the tensor_map is correctly mapping original outputs to computed output tensors during the cloning process.
3. Addressing any limitations or lack of support for certain layer behaviors (e.g., masks) during the cloning process to ensure consistent behavior.

Here's the corrected code for the _clone_functional_model function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (existing imports and function definition remain unchanged)

    # Corrected code for the _clone_functional_model function
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)
    if isinstance(model, Sequential):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a functional `Model` instance, got a `Sequential` instance instead:', model)

    # ... (existing variable initialization and input handling code remain unchanged)

    for depth in reversed(range(len(model._nodes_by_depth))):
        nodes = [model._nodes_by_depth[depth][i] for i in range(len(model._nodes_by_depth[depth]))]
        for node in nodes:
            layer = node.outbound_layer

            if layer not in layer_map:
                new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
                layer_map[layer] = new_layer
                layer = new_layer
            else:
                layer = layer_map[layer]
                if isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
                    continue

            reference_input_tensors = node.input_tensors
            reference_output_tensors = node.output_tensors

            computed_data = []
            for x in reference_input_tensors:
                if x in tensor_map:
                    computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])

            if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
                kwargs = node.arguments if node.arguments else {}
                if len(computed_data) == 1:
                    computed_tensor, computed_mask = computed_data[0]
                    if has_arg(layer.call, 'mask'):
                        if 'mask' not in kwargs:
                            kwargs['mask'] = computed_mask
                    output_tensors = layer(computed_tensor, **kwargs)
                    output_tensors = to_list(output_tensors)
                    computed_tensors = [computed_tensor]
                    computed_masks = [computed_mask] if has_arg(layer.call, 'mask') else [None]
                else:
                    computed_tensors, computed_masks = zip(*computed_data)
                    if has_arg(layer.call, 'mask'):
                        if 'mask' not in kwargs:
                            kwargs['mask'] = computed_masks
                    output_tensors = layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs)
                    output_tensors = to_list(output_tensors)
                    computed_masks = computed_masks if has_arg(layer.call, 'mask') else [None] * len(computed_tensors)

                for x, y, mask in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors, computed_masks):
                    tensor_map[x] = (y, mask)

    output_tensors = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in model.outputs]
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```
By making adjustments to the computation and mapping of output tensors, and ensuring proper handling of layer behaviors, the corrected function should resolve the issues encountered during the cloning process. This updated function can be used as a drop-in replacement for the buggy version of the function.
