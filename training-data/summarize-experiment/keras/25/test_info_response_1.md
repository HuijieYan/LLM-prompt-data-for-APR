Upon analyzing the error message, it appears that the problem occurs within the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function, specifically when the mode equals 'torch', and `data_format` is 'channels_last'. In this case, the code attempts to subtract an array from a scalar value. This results in a `UFuncTypeError` indicating that it is not possible to cast the output from the ufunc 'subtract' from type float64 to type int32 with the casting rule 'same_kind'.

The `UFuncTypeError` error occurs at line 82 in the `keras/applications/imagenet_utils.py` file. The relevant code section in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is as follows:
```python
if mode == 'torch':
    x /= 255.
    mean = [0.485, 0.456, 0.406]
    std = [0.229, 0.224, 0.225]
else:
    if data_format == 'channels_first':
        # 'RGB'->'BGR'
        if x.ndim == 3:
            x = x[::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
    else:
        # 'RGB'->'BGR'
        x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = [103.939, 116.779, 123.68]
        std = None
```

Therefore, the issue lies in the computation related to the `mean` variable when `mode == 'torch'`. The code attempts to subtract a list from an array which results in a type mismatch error.

To fix this issue, it is required to ensure that the `mean` values are compatible with the data type of the input array `x`. Specifically, the `mean` values should be of the same data type as the input array `x` in order to avoid type casting issues, especially when performing arithmetic operations.

A potential fix for this problem could involve explicitly converting the `mean` list to the same data type as `x`. This can be done using NumPy's `astype` function to convert the `mean` list to the same data type as `x` before performing the subtraction operation. Applying the same data type to both the `mean` list and the input array `x` would ensure compatibility and prevent the `UFuncTypeError` from occurring.
