From the provided test function `test_preprocess_input` and the corresponding error message, it is evident that the error occurs in the context of passing an input array, `xint`, which is of type `int32` to the `utils.preprocess_input` function. This error arises from an attempt to modify the `int32` type array using floating-point values in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function. The error is specifically related to the line: 

```python
>           x[..., 0] -= mean[0]
E           numpy.core._exceptions.UFuncTypeError: Cannot cast ufunc 'subtract' output from dtype('float64') to dtype('int32') with casting rule 'same_kind'
```

The error message reveals that a UFuncTypeError is being raised due to the inability to cast the result of the subtraction operation (dtype of 'float64') to the dtype of the input array (dtype of 'int32').

To address this issue, it is necessary to handle the input array `xint` with `dtype('int32')` separately within the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function to ensure that the data type consistency is maintained. One approach to resolve this issue could be to explicitly cast the computed values to the same data type as the input array `xint` before performing the subtraction operation, ensuring that the data types are compatible and consistent throughout the computation. Additionally, proper checks and conversions should be implemented to handle the data type differences for different modes and data formats to avoid similar errors in the future.

By carefully analyzing the test function and the error message, it is evident that the root cause of the problem lies in the mismatch of data types and the need for explicit type handling to ensure consistent and compatible data types during the preprocessing operations on the input array.
