The function `_preprocess_numpy_input` takes in a Numpy array `x`, a string `data_format`, and a string `mode`. The logic of the function involves preprocessing the input array based on the specified `data_format` and `mode`.

If the `mode` is 'tf', the function scales the input array between -1 and 1 and returns the preprocessed array.

If the `mode` is 'torch', the function scales the input array between 0 and 1 and normalizes each channel with respect to the ImageNet dataset using predefined mean and standard deviation values.

If neither of the above conditions are met, the function applies specific transformations based on the `data_format`, such as converting 'RGB' to 'BGR' and calculates the mean and standard deviation values accordingly to normalize the input array.

The expected return value for the provided test case involves applying transformations based on the 'channels_last' `data_format` and 'caffe' `mode`, resulting in a preprocessed Numpy array with shape (2, 10, 10, 3) and updated mean values.
