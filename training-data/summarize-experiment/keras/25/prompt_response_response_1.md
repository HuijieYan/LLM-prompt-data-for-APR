Based on the analysis, it is evident that the bug in the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function is caused by the inconsistent handling of data types and incorrect preprocessing operations based on the specified mode and data format. To resolve this issue, the code needs to be modified to ensure the consistent handling of different data types and the correct preprocessing operations based on the specified parameters.

The revised version of the function is provided below, addressing the identified issues and ensuring consistent data type handling and accurate preprocessing operations based on the specified mode and data format.

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.

    # Returns
        Preprocessed Numpy array.
    """
    if mode == 'tf':
        x = np.array(x, dtype=np.float32)
        x /= 127.5
        x -= 1.
        return x

    if mode == 'torch':
        x = np.array(x, dtype=np.float32)
        x /= 255.
        mean = np.array([0.485, 0.456, 0.406])
        std = np.array([0.229, 0.224, 0.225])
    else:
        x = np.array(x, dtype=np.float32)
        if data_format == 'channels_first':
            if x.ndim == 3:
                x = x[::-1, ...]
            else:
                x = x[:, ::-1, ...]
        else:
            x = x[..., ::-1]
        mean = np.array([103.939, 116.779, 123.68])
        std = None

    # Zero-center by mean pixel and normalize
    x -= mean
    if std is not None:
        x /= std
    return x
```

In the revised version of the function, I explicitly converted the input array 'x' to type `np.float32` according to the specified mode to ensure consistent data type handling. Additionally, the preprocessing operations are performed uniformly regardless of data format and mode, ensuring accurate handling of the input array. Furthermore, I modified the logic to calculate mean and standard deviation values and applied the necessary preprocessing operations consistently.

This revised version of the function resolves the identified issues by addressing the data type compatibility and ensuring accurate preprocessing based on the specified mode and data format, thereby resolving the bug and generating the expected preprocessed Numpy array output.
