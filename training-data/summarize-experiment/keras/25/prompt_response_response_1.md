Based on the analysis and the error message, the bug occurs when the mode equals 'torch', and `data_format` is 'channels_last'. This results in a `UFuncTypeError` indicating that it is not possible to cast the output from the ufunc 'subtract' from type float64 to type int32 with the casting rule 'same_kind'.

The issue lies in the computation related to the `mean` variable when `mode == 'torch'`. The code attempts to subtract a list from an array, which results in a type mismatch error.

To fix this issue, we can explicitly convert the `mean` list to the same data type as the input array `x`. This can be done using NumPy's `astype` function to convert the `mean` list to the same data type as `x` before performing the subtraction operation.

Here's the corrected code for the `_preprocess_numpy_input` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def _preprocess_numpy_input(x, data_format, mode):
    """Preprocesses a Numpy array encoding a batch of images.

    # Arguments
        x: Input array, 3D or 4D.
        data_format: Data format of the image array.
        mode: One of "caffe", "tf" or "torch".
            - caffe: will convert the images from RGB to BGR,
                then will zero-center each color channel with
                respect to the ImageNet dataset,
                without scaling.
            - tf: will scale pixels between -1 and 1,
                sample-wise.
            - torch: will scale pixels between 0 and 1 and then
                will normalize each channel with respect to the
                ImageNet dataset.
