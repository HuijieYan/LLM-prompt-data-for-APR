1. The buggy function is intended to convert a ndarray into a date column by parsing it into different date formats. However, there are several potential issues in the function that need to be addressed.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the date conversion and the conditions for returning the data and the boolean value.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is not handling the date conversion and the conditions for returning the data and the boolean value properly. Additionally, there are potential issues with the handling of data types and the use of undefined variables.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Properly handling the date conversion and error handling
   - Ensuring that the data types are handled correctly
   - Using defined variables and functions from the numpy and pandas libraries

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            pd.isna(new_data)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data == pd.NaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return new_data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

In the corrected code:
- The `astype` method is called on `new_data` instead of `data` to convert the data type.
- The `isna` and `NaT` functions are called from the `pandas` library to handle missing values and NaT (Not a Time) values.
- The `pd.to_datetime` function is used to convert the data to datetime format.
- The corrected code also uses the correct variable names and functions from the `numpy` and `pandas` libraries.
