1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is part of the `Parser` class in the file `pandas/io/json/_json.py`. It is responsible for trying to parse a ndarray into a date column by coercing object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch formats.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be the handling of the `new_data` variable and the conversion to date using the `to_datetime` function.

3. The bug's cause could be related to the incorrect handling of the `new_data` variable and the date conversion process. The function tries to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch formats, but the handling of the data and the date conversion process may not be implemented correctly.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Properly handling the `new_data` variable and ensuring that the coercion to integer/float and date conversion process is done correctly.
   - Checking for any potential errors in the date conversion process and handling them appropriately.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
                return new_data, True
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
        return data, False
```

In the corrected code, the handling of the `new_data` variable has been fixed, and the date conversion process using the `to_datetime` function has been updated to handle potential errors. Additionally, the `new_data` variable is properly returned after the date conversion process.
