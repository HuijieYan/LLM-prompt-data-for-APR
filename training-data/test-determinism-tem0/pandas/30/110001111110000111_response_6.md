The buggy function is `_try_convert_to_date` in the file `pandas/io/json/_json.py`. This function is responsible for converting data into a date column and is used in the `read_json` function.

The failing test `test_readjson_bool_series` in the file `pandas/tests/io/json/test_pandas.py` is trying to read a JSON string containing boolean values and convert it into a Pandas Series. However, the function is currently raising a TypeError when trying to convert boolean values to datetime.

The error message indicates that the issue is occurring when trying to convert boolean values to datetime, which is not a valid operation.

The GitHub issue describes the problem in detail, stating that the expected output should be a Pandas Series of bools, but instead, it results in a TypeError. It also mentions that this behavior is inconsistent with the "frame" case and that it worked in older versions of Pandas.

To fix the bug, the `_try_convert_to_date` function needs to handle boolean values differently and return a Pandas Series of bools instead of trying to convert them to datetime.

Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # handle boolean values
    if new_data.dtype == "bool":
        return new_data, True

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

With this corrected code, the `_try_convert_to_date` function will now handle boolean values correctly and return a Pandas Series of bools when encountering boolean data. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and also pass the failing test.
