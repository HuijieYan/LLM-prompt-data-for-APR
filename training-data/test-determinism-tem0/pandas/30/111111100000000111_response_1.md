1. The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is part of the `Parser` class in the file `pandas/io/json/_json.py`. The function is responsible for converting data into a date column, but it has a bug that causes it to return incorrect results, as reported in the GitHub issue.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the logic for converting data to datetime and handling different data types.

3. The bug's cause is likely due to incorrect handling of boolean data types and the logic for converting data to datetime. The function is not correctly identifying boolean data and is attempting to convert it to datetime, resulting in the unexpected output.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Adding a check to handle boolean data separately and return it as is without attempting to convert to datetime.
   - Refactoring the logic for data type conversion to ensure that boolean data is handled correctly.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        if not len(data):
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number) or new_data.dtype == bool:
            return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

This corrected code includes a check to handle boolean data separately and return it as is without attempting to convert to datetime. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
