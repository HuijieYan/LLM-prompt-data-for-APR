The bug in the provided function is that it is not correctly converting the data to a date format and returning the correct boolean value indicating whether the conversion was successful.

The potential error location is in the section where it checks for the dtype of the data and tries to convert it to int64. It also checks for numbers that are out of range, but the logic seems to be incorrect.

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the data type and the logic for checking if the numbers are in range.

To fix the bug, we can update the function to correctly handle the data type conversion and the logic for checking if the numbers are in range.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return new_data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

With this corrected code, the function should now correctly handle the data type conversion and the logic for checking if the numbers are in range, and it should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
