1. The buggy function is part of the Parser class. It is intended to convert a given data array into a date column by parsing it. However, there are several potential error locations within the function, including the handling of empty data, the conversion of data types, and the parsing of date units.

2. The potential error locations within the problematic function include the handling of empty data, the conversion of data types, and the parsing of date units.

3. The potential cause of the bug could be related to the incorrect handling of data types and the parsing of date units within the function. Additionally, there may be issues with the handling of empty data and the return values.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Checking for empty data at the beginning of the function and returning early if the data is empty.
   - Ensuring that the data type conversion is handled correctly and that errors are caught and handled appropriately.
   - Reviewing the parsing of date units to ensure that it is done correctly and that any potential errors are handled properly.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        if not len(data):  # Check for empty data
            return data, False

        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = new_data.astype("int64")  # Corrected data type conversion
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass

        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data) | (new_data > self.min_stamp) | (new_data == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False

        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)  # Corrected parsing of date units
                return new_data, True
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
        return data, False
```

In the corrected code, we have added a check for empty data at the beginning of the function and return early if the data is empty. We have also corrected the data type conversion and the parsing of date units to ensure that potential errors are handled properly.
