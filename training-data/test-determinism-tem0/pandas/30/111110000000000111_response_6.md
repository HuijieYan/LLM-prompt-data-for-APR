1. The buggy function is part of the Parser class and is responsible for converting data into a date column. The GitHub issue is related to using the read_json function with typ="series" of a JSON list of bools resulting in timestamps or an exception. The issue is described in detail, including the expected output and the versions of pandas and other related libraries being used.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conversion of data to a date column, which is causing unexpected behavior when dealing with boolean values.

3. The bug's cause is likely due to the function incorrectly handling boolean values and attempting to convert them into date formats. This is evident from the GitHub issue, which describes the unexpected output of timestamps instead of a series of bools.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Adding a condition to check for boolean values and handle them separately from date conversions.
   - Modifying the function to only convert non-boolean values to date formats.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

class Parser():
    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
        
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = data.astype("int64")
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
        
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number) or new_data.dtype == "bool":
            return data, False
        
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

This corrected code includes a condition to check for boolean values and return False without attempting to convert them to date formats. This should resolve the issue described in the GitHub problem statement.
