1. The `_clone_functional_model` function intends to clone a functional `Model` instance with new layers and weights without sharing the weights of the existing layers. However, there are several issues in the implementation of this function, leading to the failing test.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the part where the output tensors are being checked.

3. Bug's cause:
   (a). The `_clone_functional_model` function tries to create a new model by iterating over the nodes in the reference model and attempting to compute the output tensors. This process involves creating new layers and mapping input and output tensors. However, the implementation of this process has several issues, leading to an assertion error when checking the computed output tensors.
   (b). The failing test `test_clone_functional_model_with_multi_outputs` creates a model with multiple inputs and outputs, which triggers the `_clone_functional_model` function. The failing assertion error is caused by the issue in the `_clone_functional_model` function.
   (c). The error message indicates that the assertion for one of the output tensors fails, indicating that the output tensor is not computed correctly during the cloning process.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   (a). Reviewing the logic for creating and mapping input and output tensors within the `_clone_functional_model` function to ensure that all tensors are correctly mapped and computed.
   (b). Ensuring that the process of recreating layers and computing output tensors during model cloning is handled accurately.
   (c). Addressing any issues related to mapping input and output tensors, especially in the case of models with multiple inputs and outputs.

5. Corrected code for the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    if not isinstance(model, Model):
        raise ValueError('Expected `model` argument to be a `Model` instance, got ', model)

    layer_map = {}  # Cache for created layers.
    tensor_map = {}  # Map {reference_tensor: (corresponding_tensor, mask)}

    if input_tensors is None:
        input_layers = model._input_layers
        input_tensors = [Input(batch_shape=layer.batch_input_shape,
                               dtype=layer.dtype,
                               sparse=layer.sparse,
                               name=layer.name) for layer in input_layers]

    for original_layer, new_layer in zip(model._input_layers, input_tensors):
        layer_map[original_layer] = new_layer

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    for layer in model.layers:
        if layer not in layer_map:
            new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
            layer_map[layer] = new_layer

    for x, y in zip(model.layers, layer_map.values()):
        tensor_map[x.output] = (y.output, None)

    output_tensors = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in model.outputs]
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

This corrected code addresses the issues in the original `_clone_functional_model` function by accurately creating and mapping input and output tensors, and properly recreating layers during the model cloning process. This corrected code should pass the failing test.
