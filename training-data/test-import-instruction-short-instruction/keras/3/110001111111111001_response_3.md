Based on the given information, the issue lies in the computation of the model outputs on line 166 of the _clone_functional_model function. It is failing to find the output tensors in the tensor_map.

The cause of the bug is that the output tensors are not being properly mapped in the tensor_map during the process of cloning the layers.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the output tensors are correctly mapped in the tensor_map. This can be achieved by keeping track of the output tensors during the iteration over the nodes in the reference model and updating the tensor_map accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the _clone_functional_model function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # existing code

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # Iterated over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # existing code for creating or reusing layers
            # Gather inputs to call the new layer.
            reference_input_tensors = node.input_tensors
            reference_output_tensors = node.output_tensors

            # If all previous input tensors are available in tensor_map,
            # then call node.outbound_layer on them.
            computed_data = []  # List of tuples (input, mask).
            for x in reference_input_tensors:
                if x in tensor_map:
                    computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])

            if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
                # Call layer.
                computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]
                kwargs = node.arguments if node.arguments else {}
                computed_mask = None  # adjust accordingly if masks are supported
                output_tensors = node.outbound_layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs)

                for x, y in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors):
                    tensor_map[x] = (y, computed_mask)

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = [tensor_map[x][0] for x in model.outputs]
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

With these changes, the _clone_functional_model function should now properly clone the functional model and pass the failing test case.
