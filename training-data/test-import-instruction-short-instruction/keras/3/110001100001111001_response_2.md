The potential error location within the buggy function seems to be in the section where it iterates over the nodes of the model. The error could be related to how the input and output tensors are handled, as well as how the computed data is processed.

The bug's cause could be related to the way the input tensors and output tensors are being handled within the iteration over the nodes of the model. It seems that the function is not correctly handling the computed data and is not updating the tensor_map properly.

To fix the bug, the function should correctly handle the input and output tensors, update the tensor_map with the correct values, and ensure that the input_tensors are properly created when not provided.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (code for input handling remains unchanged)

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # Iterated over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort()
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # Recover the corresponding layer.
            layer = node.outbound_layer

            # Get or create layer.
            if layer not in layer_map:
                # Clone layer.
                new_layer = layer.__class__.from_config(layer.get_config())
                layer_map[layer] = new_layer
                layer = new_layer
            else:
                # Reuse previously cloned layer.
                layer = layer_map[layer]
                # Don't call InputLayer multiple times.
                if isinstance(layer, InputLayer):
                    continue

            # Gather inputs to call the new layer.
            reference_input_tensors = node.input_tensors
            reference_output_tensors = node.output_tensors

            # If all previous input tensors are available in tensor_map,
            # then call node.inbound_layer on them.
            computed_data = []  # List of tuples (input, mask).
            for x in reference_input_tensors:
                if x in tensor_map:
                    computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])

            if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
                # Call layer.
                kwargs = {}
                computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]
                computed_masks = [x[1] for x in computed_data]
                if has_arg(layer.call, 'mask'):
                    kwargs['mask'] = computed_masks
                output_tensors = to_list(layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))
                output_masks = to_list(layer.compute_mask(computed_tensors, computed_masks))
                # Update tensor_map.
                for x, y, mask in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors, output_masks):
                    tensor_map[x] = (y, mask)

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        tensor, _ = tensor_map[x]
        output_tensors.append(tensor)
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

The corrected code ensures that the input and output tensors are properly handled, and that the tensor_map is updated correctly throughout the function.
