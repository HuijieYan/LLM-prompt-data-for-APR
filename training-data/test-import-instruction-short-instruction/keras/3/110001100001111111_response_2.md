Potential error location:

The error is likely occurring in the loop where the `output_masks` are being computed, specifically in the `layer.compute_mask` call. The issue seems to be related to layers that do not support masks, leading to the `compute_mask` function returning `None`, which causes the assertion error when checking the `output_masks`.

Bug's cause:

The bug is caused by the `compute_mask` function returning `None` for layers that do not support masks, leading to an incorrect value for `output_masks`. This is due to the use of layers that do not support masks in the functional model, which causes the error in the `clone_model` function.

Approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Modify the `compute_mask` call to handle cases where the layer does not support masks and ensure that it does not return `None`.
2. Check for layer support for masks before calling the `compute_mask` function, and handle the case accordingly.

The corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # Iterate over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # Skip layers that do not support masks
            if not hasattr(node.outbound_layer, 'compute_mask'):
                continue

            # ... (remaining code remains unchanged)

    # ... (remaining code remains unchanged)
```

This correction checks for the presence of the `compute_mask` function in the layer before using it and handles cases where the layer does not support masks. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
