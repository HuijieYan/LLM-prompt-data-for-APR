The issue seems to be related to the cloning of a functional model with a layer that has multiple outputs without mask support. The error message indicates that the output mask is always None, which causes the AssertionError during the model cloning process.

The potential error location within the problematic function is identified in the section where the output masks are being computed for each layer. The issue arises when a layer without mask support is encountered, leading to the computed output masks being None.

The GitHub issue provides context on how the error can occur when using a functional model with a layer that has more outputs without mask support. The issue also highlights that the output_masks will always be None in such cases.

To fix this bug, the function `_clone_functional_model` needs to be updated to handle layers without mask support and properly compute the output masks for such layers.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # existing code...

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # Iterate over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # existing code...

            if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
                # existing code...

                # Update tensor_map and handle layers without mask support.
                for x, y in zip(reference_output_tensors, output_tensors):
                    tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # handle layers without mask support

    output_tensors = []
    for x in model.outputs:
        assert x in tensor_map, 'Could not compute output ' + str(x)
        tensor, mask = tensor_map[x]
        output_tensors.append(tensor)
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

This corrected code will handle layers without mask support by setting the output mask to None for those layers. It should resolve the AssertionError when cloning a functional model with layers having multiple outputs without mask support.

The corrected function is expected to pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. It should also successfully resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post related to the model cloning process.
