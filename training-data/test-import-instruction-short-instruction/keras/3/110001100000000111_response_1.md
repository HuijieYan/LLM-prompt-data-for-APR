1. The buggy function, `_clone_functional_model`, is responsible for cloning a functional `Model` instance in Keras. The GitHub issue reports an error when using `clone_model` in the context of `multi_gpu_model` with `cpu_relocation=True`. The issue seems to stem from the function not properly handling the cloning process, which results in an error related to computing the output tensor.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function seems to be in the section where it handles reference output tensors and attempts to compute their masks. This is evident from the traceback in the GitHub issue, which points to a specific line in the function where the error occurs.

3. The bug's cause can be elucidated as follows:
   (a). The buggy function `_clone_functional_model` is not properly handling the cloning process for a functional model, leading to issues when computing output tensors and their associated masks.
   (b). The related functions, such as `clone_model` and `multi_gpu_model`, are invoking the problematic function and encountering the error due to the incorrect handling of output masks.
   (c). The GitHub issue provides specific details about the error, including the line numbers in the Keras source code where the issue arises. It also highlights the root cause of the error, which is related to the use of a layer without mask support.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Revise the function `_clone_functional_model` to properly handle the cloning of a functional model, including the computation of output tensors and masks.
   (b). Ensure that the function can accommodate layers without mask support, such as Lambda layers, and handle their outputs appropriately during the cloning process.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `_clone_functional_model` that addresses the issue reported in the GitHub bug:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (existing code)

    for x, y in zip(model.outputs, output_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = y  # Update tensor_map without masks

    # Check that we did compute the model outputs,
    # then instantiate a new model from inputs and outputs.
    output_tensors = [tensor_map[x] for x in model.outputs]  # Only fetch tensors without masks
    return Model(input_tensors, output_tensors, name=model.name)
```

In the corrected code, we remove the handling of masks for the output tensors and simply update the `tensor_map` with the computed output tensors without masks. This approach resolves the issue reported in the GitHub bug by bypassing the mask computation for layers without mask support, such as Lambda layers.
