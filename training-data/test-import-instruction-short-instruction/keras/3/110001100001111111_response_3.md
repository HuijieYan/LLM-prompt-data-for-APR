The issue seems to be related to the usage of the `clone_model` function in Keras, especially when dealing with layers that don't support masking, such as the `Lambda` layer in the given example. The problem appears to be stemming from the cloning process where the `compute_mask` method of the layers returns `None` when it is expected to return a list of masks.

The potential error location within the function seems to be around the `compute_mask` method call for layers that don't support masking. This results in the `output_masks` being set to `None` when it should be a list of masks.

To fix the bug, the `clone_model` function needs to be modified to handle the case where the `compute_mask` method returns `None`. Instead of assuming that the output_masks will always be non-None, the function should check if the layer supports masking and only call `compute_mask` if it does.

Additionally, the function should ensure that it handles the case of layers not supporting masking by setting the `output_masks` to `None` for those layers.

The corrected code for the problematic function should handle these cases and ensure that it produces the correct output masks, as well as addressing the issue with multi_gpu_model when using clone_model.

Here's the corrected version of the `_clone_functional_model` function:

```python
def _clone_functional_model(model, input_tensors=None):
    # ... (existing function code)

    for x, y in zip(model.inputs, input_tensors):
        tensor_map[x] = (y, None)  # tensor, mask

    # Iterated over every node in the reference model, in depth order.
    depth_keys = list(model._nodes_by_depth.keys())
    depth_keys.sort(reverse=True)
    for depth in depth_keys:
        nodes = model._nodes_by_depth[depth]
        for node in nodes:
            # ... (existing code for recovering layers etc.)

            if has_arg(layer.call, 'mask'):
                computed_data = []  # List of tuples (input, mask).
                for x in reference_input_tensors:
                    if x in tensor_map:
                        computed_data.append(tensor_map[x])

                if len(computed_data) == len(reference_input_tensors):
                    if len(computed_data) == 1:
                        computed_tensor, computed_mask = computed_data[0]
                    else:
                        computed_tensors = [x[0] for x in computed_data]
                        computed_masks = [x[1] for x in computed_data]
                        if 'mask' not in kwargs:
                            kwargs['mask'] = computed_masks

                    output_tensors = to_list(
                        layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))
                    output_masks = to_list(
                        layer.compute_mask(computed_tensors,
                                           computed_masks))

                    # Update tensor_map.
                    for x, y, mask in zip(reference_output_tensors,
                                          output_tensors,
                                          output_masks):
                        tensor_map[x] = (y, mask)
                else:
                    # Set output_masks to None if compute_mask is not supported
                    output_tensors = to_list(
                        layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))
                    tensor_map[x] = (y, None)
            else:
                # Set output_masks to None if compute_mask is not supported
                output_tensors = to_list(
                    layer(computed_tensors, **kwargs))
                tensor_map[x] = (y, None)

    # ... (existing function code)
```

Now, the function checks for the support of masking in the layers and handles cases where `compute_mask` returns `None` appropriately. This should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
