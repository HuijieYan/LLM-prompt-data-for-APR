The bug in the provided code seems to be with the recursive call to the pivot_table function inside the if statement where aggfunc is a list. This recursive call is causing the function to behave unexpectedly and produce incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the recursive call to pivot_table needs to be replaced with a different approach to achieve the desired functionality.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to modify the section of the code where the aggfunc is a list. Instead of recursively calling pivot_table, we can use a different logic to achieve the aggregation for multiple functions in the list.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot_table"], indents=1)
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    index = _convert_by(index)
    columns = _convert_by(columns)

    if isinstance(aggfunc, list):
        pieces: List[DataFrame] = []
        keys = []
        for func in aggfunc:
            grouped = data.groupby(keys, observed=observed)
            agged = grouped.agg(func)
            pieces.append(agged)
            keys.append(getattr(func, "__name__", func))

        return concat(pieces, keys=keys, axis=1)

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

This corrected code consolidates the results of each aggregation function in the list into a list of DataFrames, then concatenates them to produce the final result.

This modification should fix the bug and ensure that the function behaves as expected based on the input/output variable information provided.
