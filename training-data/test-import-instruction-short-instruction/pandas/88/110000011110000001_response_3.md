The buggy function is `pivot_table` from the pandas library. The failing test for this function is `test_pivot_table_multiindex_only` in the file pandas/tests/reshape/test_pivot.py. The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError related to the 'columns' attribute of a Series object in the `pivot_table` function.

The potential error location within the problematic function is likely related to the manipulation of the 'table' object and trying to access the 'columns' attribute.

The cause of the bug can be attributed to incorrect handling of the 'table' object. The failing test and error message indicate that the 'table' object is being accessed as a Series instead of a DataFrame, resulting in the AttributeError related to the 'columns' attribute.

To fix the bug, the 'table' object should be handled as a DataFrame throughout the function to avoid the AttributeError related to the 'columns' attribute of a Series. Additionally, the code should be refactored to ensure that the 'table' object maintains its DataFrame structure in all the conditions.

Here's a corrected version of the `pivot_table` function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":
    # ... (other code remains unchanged)
    
    table = agged
    if table.index.nlevels > 1:
        # Related GH #17123
        # If index_names are integers, determine whether the integers refer
        # to the level position or name.
        index_names = agged.index.names[: len(index)]
    to_unstack = []
    for i in range(len(index), len(keys)):
        name = agged.index.names[i]
        if name is None or name in index_names:
            to_unstack.append(i)
        else:
            to_unstack.append(name)
    table = agged.unstack(to_unstack)

    # Rest of the code remains unchanged...

    return table
```

With this corrected code, the `pivot_table` function should handle the 'table' object correctly, ensuring that it remains as a DataFrame and resolves the AttributeError related to the 'columns' attribute. This corrected version should pass the failing test mentioned.
