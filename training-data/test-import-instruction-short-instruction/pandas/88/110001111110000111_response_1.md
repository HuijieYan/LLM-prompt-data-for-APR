Potential error location:
The error seems to be occurring when the pivot_table function is attempting to access the columns attribute for a Series object. This could be due to a mismatch in the output type of the pivot_table function. It looks like the function is expecting to return a DataFrame, but under certain conditions, it might be returning a Series instead.

Bug Cause:
The bug seems to be caused by the pivot_table function returning a Series object in certain cases, instead of a DataFrame. This causes issues when trying to access the columns attribute on the Series object.

Suggested approach for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the pivot_table function always returns a DataFrame, even in cases where it currently returns a Series.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def pivot_table(
    data,
    values=None,
    index=None,
    columns=None,
    aggfunc="mean",
    fill_value=None,
    margins=False,
    dropna=True,
    margins_name="All",
    observed=False,
) -> "DataFrame":

    # existing code ...

    # The following line ensures that the output of pivot_table is always a DataFrame
    table = table if isinstance(table, pd.DataFrame) else table.to_frame()

    return table
```

With this correction, the pivot_table function will always return a DataFrame, resolving the issue of accessing the columns attribute on a Series object. This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub bug report.
