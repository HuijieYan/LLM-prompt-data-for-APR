1. The buggy function seems to be designed to adjust a datetime object based on business hours and business days. It checks if the input is a datetime object, then performs various calculations based on business days and business hours to adjust the input datetime.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be the conditionals that check for specific cases (n >= 0, n < 0) and the calculations performed based on these conditions.

3. The bug's cause might be related to incorrect calculations and conditions for adjusting the input datetime based on business days and business hours.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Debug the conditionals and calculations to ensure they are correctly handling cases where n is greater or less than 0.
   - Review the logic around adjusting business days and business hours to ensure it accurately reflects the intended behavior.

5. Corrected code:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessDay

    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        # used for detecting edge condition
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        
        # check if it's a business day
        if self.on_offset(other):
            return other

        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:

                if bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and nanosecond != 0):
                    other += bhour_remain
                    break
                else:
