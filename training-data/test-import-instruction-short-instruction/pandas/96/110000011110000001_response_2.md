1. The buggy function is a part of the pandas library and is used to handle custom business hours with datetime values. The failing test function `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is testing the behavior of the `pd.date_range` function with custom business hours. The error message indicates a ValueError raised during frequency validation.

2. The potential error location within the buggy function is when it tries to validate the frequency for the given DatetimeArray/Index.

3. The bug's cause is likely the incorrect adjustment of business days and business hours within the apply function. This leads to the generation of incorrect frequencies, causing the failure in the frequency validation during the test.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include revisiting the logic for adjusting business days and business hours within the apply function. Additionally, checking the logic for handling holidays and edge cases is essential.

5. Corrected code for the apply function is as follows:

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from pandas.tseries.offsets import CustomBusinessHour
import pandas as pd
import pandas._testing as tm

def apply_wraps(func):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
        return func(*args, **kwargs)
    return wrapper

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        # adjust other to reduce number of cases to handle
        if n >= 0:
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # adjustment to move to previous business day
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # get total business hours by sec in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            self._get_business_hours_by_sec(st, en)
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours // 60)
        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        # adjust by business days first
        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = CustomBusinessHour(start=self.start, end=self.end, holidays=self.holidays, n=bd)
            other = other + skip_bd

        # remaining business hours to adjust
        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
            # business hour left in this business time interval
            bhour = (
                self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
            )
            if n < 0 and (bhour_remain > bhour or (bhour_remain == bhour and self.nanosecond != 0)):
                other += bhour_remain
                bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
            else:
                if bhour_remain < bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    # go to next business time interval
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

This corrected code improves the adjustment of business days and business hours within the apply function and aims to produce the correct frequencies. This corrected function should now pass the failing test.
