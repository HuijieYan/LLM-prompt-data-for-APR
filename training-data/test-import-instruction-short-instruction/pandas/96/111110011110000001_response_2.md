1. The buggy function `apply` is a member of the `BusinessHourMixin` class, which is a subclass of `BusinessMixin`. The failing test `test_date_range_with_custom_holidays` is related to the use of the `CustomBusinessHour` frequency, which depends on the `apply` function to correctly handle the business hour calculation. The error message indicates that the frequency inferred from the passed values does not conform to the passed frequency, and this is due to a ValueError being raised during validation of the frequency.

2. The potential error location within the `apply` function is when it attempts to handle the adjustment of business hours based on the specified input parameters and fails to accurately calculate the result.

3. The bug is likely caused by an incorrect calculation of business hours and an inaccurate handling of the adjustment logic. This is leading to the inferred frequency not conforming to the passed frequency, resulting in a ValueError during frequency validation.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Reviewing and correcting the logic for adjusting business hours within the `apply` function.
   - Ensuring that the adjustments based on input parameters are accurately reflected in the resulting frequency.
   - Addressing any potential discrepancies in the calculation of business hours and their application in the function.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `apply` function:

```python
# this is the corrected function
@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n
        nanosecond = getattr(other, "nanosecond", 0)
        
        # Business day calculations
        if n >= 0:
            while other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                other -= timedelta(seconds=1)
            while not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)
        
        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```

By utilizing a clearer and more precise implementation of the business day calculations and adjustments, the corrected `apply` function should be able to pass the failing test. However, due to the complex nature of the original code and the specifics of the bug, it's important to thoroughly test the corrected function to ensure its accuracy.
