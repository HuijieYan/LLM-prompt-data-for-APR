1. The buggy function appears to be a method for adjusting a datetime object by a specified number of business hours. The function first checks if the input "other" is a datetime object, and then proceeds to adjust the datetime object based on the number of business hours specified by the "self" object.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the calculation and adjustment of the business hours, as well as the logic for handling positive and negative values of "n".

3. The bug's cause is likely due to incorrect handling of business hours, improper adjustment of the datetime object based on the number of business hours, and potential issues with the calculation of business days and remaining business hours.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking and adjusting the logic for calculating business days and remaining business hours based on the sign of "n".
   - Ensuring that the adjustment of the datetime object takes into account the correct number of business hours and business days.
   - Refactoring the logic to handle positive and negative values of "n" separately.

5. Corrected code:

```python
from pandas.tseries.offsets import BusinessDay
from datetime import datetime, timedelta

@apply_wraps
def apply(self, other):
    if isinstance(other, datetime):
        n = self.n

        if n >= 0:
            # Adjust other to reduce the number of cases to handle
            if other.time() in self.end or not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
        else:
            if other.time() in self.start:
                # Adjustment to move to the previous business day
                other -= timedelta(days=1)
            if not self._is_on_offset(other):
                other = self._next_opening_time(other)
                other = self._get_closing_time(other)

        # Get total business hours by seconds in one business day
        businesshours = sum(
            (en - st).total_seconds() / 60
            for st, en in zip(self.start, self.end)
        )

        bd, r = divmod(abs(n * 60), businesshours)

        if n < 0:
            bd, r = -bd, -r

        if bd != 0:
            skip_bd = BusinessDay(n=bd)
            if not self.next_bday.is_on_offset(other):
                prev_open = self._prev_opening_time(other)
                remain = other - prev_open
                other = prev_open + skip_bd + remain
            else:
                other = other + skip_bd

        bhour_remain = timedelta(minutes=r)

        if n >= 0:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._get_closing_time(self._prev_opening_time(other)) - other
                if bhour_remain <= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._next_opening_time(other + bhour)
        else:
            while bhour_remain != timedelta(0):
                bhour = self._next_opening_time(other) - other
                if bhour_remain >= bhour:
                    other += bhour_remain
                    bhour_remain = timedelta(0)
                else:
                    bhour_remain -= bhour
                    other = self._get_closing_time(self._next_opening_time(other + bhour - timedelta(seconds=1)))

        return other
    else:
        raise ApplyTypeError("Only know how to combine business hour with datetime")
```
The corrected code adjusts the logic for calculating business days and remaining business hours based on the sign of "n", and refactors the while loops to handle positive and negative values of "n" separately. Additionally, it addresses issues with adding/subtracting timedelta values and improves the calculation of total business hours by seconds.
