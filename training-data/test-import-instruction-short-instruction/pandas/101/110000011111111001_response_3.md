The bug in the `astype_nansafe` function appears to be related to the incorrect handling of `NaT` values when converting to integer types for both datetime and timedelta arrays. This is evident from the failing test cases where the function is expected to raise a `ValueError` due to the inability to convert `NaT` values to integers, but it does not.

The potential error location within the function is likely towards the end of the large conditional block, where it attempts to handle object types, datetime/timedelta arrays, and the `dtype.name` attribute. It seems that the function does not handle the conversion of `NaT` values properly, leading to the failing tests.

To fix the bug, the function should be modified to specifically handle the conversion of `NaT` values when the input array is of datetime or timedelta type. This can be achieved by adding an additional conditional statement to check if the input array contains `NaT` values and raise a `ValueError` accordingly.

Here is the corrected code for the `astype_nansafe` function:

```python
import numpy as np

def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    # ... (other parts of the function remain unchanged)

    if is_datetime64_dtype(arr) and np.isnat(arr):
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    if is_timedelta64_dtype(arr) and np.isnat(arr):
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # ... (rest of the function remains unchanged)
```

By adding the two conditional statements to check for `NaT` values in datetime and timedelta arrays, the corrected function should now properly handle the conversion and raise a `ValueError` when necessary. This will cause the function to pass the failing test cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
