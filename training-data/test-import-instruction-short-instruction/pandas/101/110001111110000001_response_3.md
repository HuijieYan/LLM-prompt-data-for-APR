The error in the buggy function appears to be related to the handling of NaT (Not a Time) values in the datetime64 and timedelta64 types. The failing test is checking the behavior of the astype_nansafe function when provided with NaT values and an integer type, and it is expecting a ValueError to be raised. However, the function is not raising the ValueError as expected.

The potential error location within the problematic function is around the section that deals with datetime and timedelta types, specifically in the case of NaT values. It seems that the function is failing to correctly handle the conversion of NaT values to integer types.

To fix the bug, the problematic section of code that deals with NaT values in datetime and timedelta types needs to be addressed. It seems that the function is not correctly identifying and handling NaT values, leading to the failure of the test.

One approach for fixing the bug could be to explicitly check for NaT values in the input array and raise a ValueError when attempting to convert such values to integer types. Additionally, handling of NaT values in the datetime and timedelta types should be revised to ensure correct behavior.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def astype_nansafe(arr, dtype, copy: bool = True, skipna: bool = False):
    """
    Cast the elements of an array to a given dtype a nan-safe manner.

    Parameters
    ----------
    arr : ndarray
    dtype : np.dtype
    copy : bool, default True
        If False, a view will be attempted but may fail, if
        e.g. the item sizes don't align.
    skipna: bool, default False
        Whether or not we should skip NaN when casting as a string-type.

    Raises
    ------
    ValueError
        The dtype was a datetime64/timedelta64 dtype, but it had no unit.
    ValueError
        Cannot convert NaT values to integer.
    """

    # existing code ...

    if np.isnat(arr).any() and np.issubdtype(dtype, np.integer):
        raise ValueError("Cannot convert NaT values to integer")

    # remaining code ...
```

In the corrected code, we have added a check for NaT values using the `np.isnat` method. If NaT values are found and the target dtype is an integer type, a ValueError is raised as expected. This change should resolve the failing test and ensure that NaT values are handled correctly during type conversion.
