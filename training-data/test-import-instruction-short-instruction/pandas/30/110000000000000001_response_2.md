1. The buggy function is trying to convert a data array into a date column, but there are some potential issues with the logic and exception handling.

2. The potential error location is within the section of code that tries to convert the data to integer format if it is of object type and then checks for numbers out of range.

3. The bug's cause is that the function is not correctly handling the conversion of data to integer format and checking for numbers out of range. The logic for date conversion using `to_datetime` also seems flawed as it is not handling the errors properly.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Properly handle the conversion of object data to integer using try-except blocks and type checking.
   - Update the logic for checking numbers out of range to accurately handle NaN, infinity, and negative numbers.
   - Handle the date conversion using `to_datetime` in a more robust way, checking for errors and unit conversions.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = new_data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if np.issubdtype(new_data.dtype, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(data, errors="coerce", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```
In the corrected code, the function `new_data.astype("int64")` is changed to `new_data.astype("int64")` and the check for numbers out of range is updated using `np.issubdtype` and `isna`. Additionally, the `to_datetime` function is called on `data` instead of `new_data` and the errors parameter is set to "coerce" to handle parsing errors.
