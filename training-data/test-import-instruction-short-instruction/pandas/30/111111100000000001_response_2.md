1. The problematic function `_try_convert_to_date` is a method of the `Parser` class in the file `pandas/io/json/_json.py`. It is responsible for trying to parse a ndarray into a date column. The function attempts to coerce object epoch/iso formats and integer/float epoch formats into date formats.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be the try-except block that attempts to convert the data to `int64`. Additionally, the logic to check if numbers are out of range and the loop to try converting the data to datetime with different units could also be potential areas of error.

3. The cause of the bug may be due to incorrect or incomplete handling of data types and error conditions within the function. The attempt to convert data to `int64` may not be sufficient, and the logic to check for numbers out of range may not be accurate. The loop to convert data to datetime with different units may also not be functioning as intended.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Improve the data type conversion logic to handle a wider range of data formats.
   b. Revise the checks for numbers out of range to ensure accuracy.
   c. Review the loop for converting data to datetime with different units and ensure that it covers all necessary cases.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas import isna, iNaT, to_datetime

class Parser():

    def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
        """
        Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.
    
        Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
        formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
        """
        # no conversion on empty
        if not len(data):
            return data, False
    
        new_data = data
        if new_data.dtype == "object":
            try:
                new_data = pd.to_numeric(data, errors='coerce')
            except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
                pass
    
        # ignore numbers that are out of range
        if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
            in_range = (
                isna(new_data)
                | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
                | (new_data == iNaT)
            )
            if not in_range.all():
                return data, False
    
        date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
        for date_unit in date_units:
            try:
                new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="coerce", unit=date_unit)
            except (ValueError, OverflowError):
                continue
            return new_data, True
        return data, False
```

In the corrected code:
- The `pd.to_numeric` function is used to convert object data to numeric data types, with errors coerced.
- The checks for numbers out of range have been revised to accurately check for NaN values and values greater than `self.min_stamp`.
- The `to_datetime` function is now called with `errors="coerce"` to handle errors more effectively.

These changes aim to address the potential issues in the original function and improve its functionality.
