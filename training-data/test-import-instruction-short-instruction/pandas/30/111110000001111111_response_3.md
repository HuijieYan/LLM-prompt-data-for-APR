The bug is likely caused by incorrect handling of boolean data in the `_try_convert_to_date` function. This function is part of the `Parser` class, and it is intended to parse a ndarray-like input into a date column. However, it is mistakenly converting boolean data into date data, leading to unexpected behavior.

The issue reported on GitHub is related to the incorrect output of `pd.read_json` when using `typ="series"` with a JSON list of bools. Instead of returning a Pandas Series of bools, it returns a Series of timestamps or raises a TypeError. This inconsistency is due to the incorrect handling of boolean data in the `_try_convert_to_date` function, as the function is not properly handling boolean values.

To fix the bug, the `_try_convert_to_date` function needs to be updated to correctly handle boolean data and prevent it from being converted into date data.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to add a conditional check in the `_try_convert_to_date` function to explicitly handle boolean data. If the input data is boolean, it should be returned as is, without attempting to convert it to date data.

Below is the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    if data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False  # Return the boolean data as is

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
    # (previous implementation)
    # ...
```

By adding the conditional check for boolean data, the function will now correctly handle boolean inputs without attempting to convert them to date data. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub and ensure that the function behaves as expected.
