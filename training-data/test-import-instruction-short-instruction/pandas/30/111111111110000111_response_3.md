(a) The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is located in the `Parser` class within the file `pandas/io/json/_json.py`. This function is responsible for trying to parse an array-like object into a date column.

(b) The `Parser` class is related to the `json_reader` and `SeriesParser` classes, which ultimately result in the `read_json` function being called. The `read_json` function triggers the `_try_convert_to_date` function, which is currently causing the issue.

(c) The failing test function `test_readjson_bool_series` is located in the file `pandas/tests/io/json/test_pandas.py`. The error message indicates that trying to convert boolean values to datetime is causing a TypeError.

(d) The error message points to the fact that the boolean values are not convertible to datetime, and this issue was reported in the GitHub issue with the title "read_json with typ="series" of json list of bools results in timestamps/Exception." The GitHub issue clearly describes the problem as well as the expected behavior and versions of pandas and python where the issue was observed.

(e) The combination of the failing test, error message, and GitHub issue information suggests that the issue lies within the `_try_convert_to_date` function and its handling of boolean values.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the `_try_convert_to_date` function to handle boolean data appropriately and return it as a Series of boolean values.
   - Add a condition to check for boolean data and handle it separately from datetime conversion.
   - Ensure that the function returns the expected output for the provided input and passes the failing test.

5. Corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    if data.dtype == "object":
        if all(isinstance(value, (str, int, float, np.int64, np.float64)) for value in data):
            try:
                new_data = pd.to_datetime(data, errors='raise')
                return new_data, True
            except (ValueError, OverflowError, pd._libs.tslibs.parsing.TslibParsingError):
                pass
        elif all(isinstance(value, (bool, np.bool_)) for value in data):
            return data.astype(bool), True

    return data, False
```

The corrected function now includes a conditional check to handle boolean data separately and return a Series of boolean values. This correction addresses the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
