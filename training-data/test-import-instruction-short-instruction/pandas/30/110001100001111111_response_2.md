Potential error location within the problematic function:
The buggy function appears to have an issue with the date conversion logic, as it's incorrectly converting boolean values into date timestamps, leading to unexpected behavior as reported in the GitHub issue.

Bug's cause:
The bug occurs due to the incorrect handling of boolean values when trying to convert them to dates. The code incorrectly uses the `to_datetime` function to parse the boolean values, resulting in unexpected behavior.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the data type before attempting to convert to date, and handle boolean values separately to avoid using the `to_datetime` function for them.
2. Implement a conditional check to handle boolean values and coerce them into the expected data type, instead of treating them as date values.
3. Update the conversion logic to correctly recognize boolean values and avoid the need to convert them to dates.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse an ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
        if new_data.dtype == "int64":
            return new_data, True
        elif new_data.dtype == "bool":
            return new_data, True

    return data, False
```

The corrected code includes conditional checks to handle boolean values separately and returns them as is, avoiding any unnecessary date conversions. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
