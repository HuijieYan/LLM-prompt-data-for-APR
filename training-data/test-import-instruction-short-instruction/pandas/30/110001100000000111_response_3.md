1.  Analyze the buggy function and it's relationship with the related functions, the GitHub issue:

The buggy function `_try_convert_to_date` is part of the pandas/io/json/_json.py file and is related to the `pd.read_json` function. The GitHub issue suggests that when using `pd.read_json` with `typ="series"` of a JSON list of bools, it results in timestamps or an exception, rather than a series of bools as expected.

2.  Identify the potential error location within the problematic function:

The potential error location within the function is the conversion of data to datetime using the `to_datetime` function, as it is likely causing the conversion of boolean values to timestamps.

3.  Elucidate the bug's cause using:
   (a). The buggy function
   (b). The related functions
   (c). The GitHub Issue information

The bug is caused by the `_try_convert_to_date` function attempting to convert boolean values into timestamps when it should not be doing so. This behavior is contrary to the expected output of a series of bools when using `pd.read_json` with `typ="series"`.

4.  Suggest possible approaches for fixing the bug:

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the `_try_convert_to_date` function to explicitly check for boolean data and return the data as is, without attempting to convert it to timestamps. 

5.  Present the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas._libs.tslibs.nattype import NaTType
from pandas._libs.tslibs.np_datetime import OutOfBoundsDatetime

# Corrected version of the buggy function
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
        # check if data is boolean and return it as is
        if new_data.dtype == np.bool_:
            return data, False

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number) and new_data.dtype != np.bool_:
        in_range = (
            pd.isna(new_data)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data == NaTType())
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = pd.to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError, OutOfBoundsDatetime):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

In the corrected code, after checking if the data type is an object, an additional check is made to see if the data type is boolean. If it is, the original data is returned as is without attempting to convert it to timestamps. This should fix the issue described in the GitHub report.
