The problem in the buggy function is that it is attempting to parse boolean values into date formats, which is causing the unexpected behavior described in the GitHub issue. In both cases, when the input data is a boolean Series or a RangeIndex, the function is attempting to convert to date formats due to the conditions and data type checks.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the function does not attempt to parse boolean values into date formats. We can achieve this by checking for the data type and returning the original data if it is a boolean type.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the block of code that attempts to convert the data to date formats without checking for boolean values.

The bug's cause is the lack of proper handling of boolean values in the function, leading to unexpected outputs and exceptions, as described in the GitHub issue.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to check for boolean data and return the original data without attempting to parse it into date formats.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import numpy as np
from pandas.api.types import is_bool_dtype

def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    if is_bool_dtype(data):
        return data, False

    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass

    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

With this corrected code, the function will now properly handle boolean data, and the expected outputs described in the GitHub issue should be achieved.
