The issue reported on GitHub relates to a problem where using `pd.read_json` with `typ='series'` for a JSON list of bools results in either a type error or converting the bools to datetime values. This is inconsistent with the behavior for other types and is unexpected for the users.

From the provided information, it appears that the bug is caused by the `_try_convert_to_date` function. This function is designed to convert the input data into a datetime format, which is not the expected behavior when the input data is a list of booleans.

The discrepancies between the expected and actual input/output variable values are that the function should return a Series of bools but instead is either converting the bools to datetime values or raising a type error.

To fix the bug, the `_try_convert_to_date` function needs to be adjusted to handle the case where the input data is a list of bools. This can be done by checking for the data type and returning the input data without attempting to convert it to datetime.

Here's the corrected code for the `_try_convert_to_date` function:

```python
def _try_convert_to_date(self, data):
    """
    Try to parse a ndarray like into a date column.

    Try to coerce object in epoch/iso formats and integer/float in epoch
    formats. Return a boolean if parsing was successful.
    """
    # no conversion on empty
    if not len(data):
        return data, False

    new_data = data
    if new_data.dtype == "object":
        try:
            new_data = data.astype("int64")
        except (TypeError, ValueError, OverflowError):
            pass
    elif new_data.dtype == "bool":
        return data, False

    # ignore numbers that are out of range
    if issubclass(new_data.dtype.type, np.number):
        in_range = (
            isna(new_data._values)
            | (new_data > self.min_stamp)
            | (new_data._values == iNaT)
        )
        if not in_range.all():
            return data, False

    date_units = (self.date_unit,) if self.date_unit else self._STAMP_UNITS
    for date_unit in date_units:
        try:
            new_data = to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
        except (ValueError, OverflowError):
            continue
        return new_data, True
    return data, False
```

This corrected function will now return the input data without attempting to convert it to datetime if the data type is a list of bools, which resolves the issue reported on GitHub.
