1. The buggy function is a part of the pandas repository and is related to the issue on GitHub titled "BUG: Wrong error message is raised when columns=None in df.pivot." The function is supposed to pivot a DataFrame but has an issue when the "columns" parameter is set to None.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is at the beginning of the function where it checks if "values" is None and then proceeds to handle the pivot operation based on the presence of "values" and "index".

3. The cause of the bug can be elucidated as follows:
   (a). The buggy function does not handle the case when "columns" is set to None properly, leading to a misleading error message.
   (b). The GitHub issue highlights that the error message raised when "columns" is set to None is confusing and should instead indicate that "columns" is not optional.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   (a). Checking whether "columns" is set to None, and if so, raising a more informative error message indicating that "columns" is not optional.
   (b). Ensuring that the function handles the scenario when "columns" is set to None in a way that either raises an appropriate error or modifies the behavior to handle this case correctly.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function that addresses the bug and resolves the issue posted on GitHub:

```python
@Substitution("\ndata : DataFrame")
@Appender(_shared_docs["pivot"], indents=1)
def pivot(data: "DataFrame", index=None, columns=None, values=None) -> "DataFrame":
    if columns is None:
        raise ValueError("columns parameter is required for pivot operation")
    if values is None:
        cols = [columns] if index is None else [index, columns]
        append = index is None
        indexed = data.set_index(cols, append=append)
    else:
        if index is None:
            index = data.index
        else:
            index = data[index]
        index = MultiIndex.from_arrays([index, data[columns]])

        if is_list_like(values) and not isinstance(values, tuple):
            # Exclude tuple because it is seen as a single column name
            indexed = data._constructor(
                data[values].values, index=index, columns=values
            )
        else:
            indexed = data._constructor_sliced(data[values].values, index=index)
    return indexed.unstack(columns)
```

The corrected function now includes a check for the "columns" parameter and raises a ValueError if it is set to None, providing a more informative error message. This resolves the issue reported on GitHub by ensuring that the function handles the "columns=None" scenario appropriately.
