Given the extensive body of the code and the complexity involved, it is not feasible to precisely determine the root cause of the bug with absolute certainty. However, potential areas for error could be within the for loop where the variable 'result' is being assigned, and there might be issues with conditional statements causing improper handling of the data. Additionally, there could be potential issues with the manipulation of 'new_items' and 'deleted_items' lists.

To fix the bug, a thorough review of the for loop and the conditional statements can be performed to ensure proper handling of data and error conditions. It is crucial to consider the overall data flow within the function and verify that the aggregation logic is correctly implemented. Debugging and adding more comprehensive error handling could also be beneficial.

Below is a possible corrected version of the function, taking into consideration the previously mentioned potential error locations:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    deleted_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    split_frames: List[DataFrame] = []

    no_result = object()
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = no_result
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is not None:
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                    obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]

                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                try:
                    result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                except TypeError:
                    deleted_items.append(locs)
                    continue
                else:
                    result = cast(DataFrame, result)
                    if len(result._data.blocks) != 1:
                        split_items.append(locs)
                        split_frames.append(result)
                        continue

                    assert len(result._data.blocks) == 1
                    result = result._data.blocks[0].values
                    if isinstance(result, np.ndarray) and result.ndim == 1:
                        result = result.reshape(1, -1)

        if result is not no_result and not isinstance(result, DataFrame):
            result = maybe_downcast_numeric(result, block.dtype)
            if block.is_extension and isinstance(result, np.ndarray):
                assert result.ndim == 1 or result.shape[0] == 1
                try:
                    result = type(block.values)._from_sequence(
                        result.ravel(), dtype=block.values.dtype
                    )
                except ValueError:
                    result = result.reshape(1, -1)

            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)
        else:
            deleted_items.append(locs)

    if not (agg_blocks or split_frames):
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    if split_items:
        for locs, result in zip(split_items, split_frames):
            assert len(locs) == result.shape[1]
            for i, loc in enumerate(locs):
                new_items.append(np.array([loc], dtype=locs.dtype))
                agg_blocks.append(result.iloc[:, [i]]._data.blocks[0])

    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))

    if deleted_items:
        deleted = np.concatenate(deleted_items)
        ai = np.arange(len(data))
        mask = np.zeros(len(data))
        mask[deleted] = 1
        indexer = (ai - mask.cumsum())[indexer]

    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version of the function focuses on the handling of the 'result' variable, proper error handling, and ensuring the manipulation of lists such as 'new_items' and 'deleted_items' is done accurately. It is important to thoroughly review and test this corrected code to ensure that it correctly resolves the issues observed in the initial buggy function.
