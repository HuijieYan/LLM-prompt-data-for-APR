The code needs to be modified in the _cython_agg_blocks function in the DataFrameGroupBy class of the pandas library. The issue lies in the type conversion from float to int. This can be handled by adjusting the data type when values are created from the output for "mean", "median", and "var" operations. However, based on the task description, the entire function isn't provided. Therefore, here's a broad idea of how you could modify the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # ... (existing code)

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    # Rest of the function ...

    for block in data.blocks:
        # previous code for processing the blocks

        if result.dtype == np.float64:
            result = result.astype(np.int64)  # Adjusting the data type

        # ... (remaining code as it is)

    # ... (rest of the function body)
```

By adjusting the data type for "mean", "median", and "var" operations in the _cython_agg_blocks function, the type conversion issue should be resolved.
