The buggy function appears to be trying to aggregate data based on the input parameters and the data provided. It seems that the function is not handling the different input scenarios correctly, resulting in an incorrect output.

The potential error location within the function seems to be in the section where it handles the aggregation of the data blocks. It looks like there are issues with how the aggregation is being performed, especially when non-numeric values or exceptions are encountered.

The cause of the bug is likely related to how the function handles different aggregation methods and how it processes the data blocks. It seems that the function is not robust enough to handle all possible scenarios, leading to incorrect output.

To fix the bug, the function needs to be modified to handle all potential scenarios robustly and ensure that the aggregation is performed correctly in all cases.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
    
    for block in data.blocks:
        result = None
        locs = block.mgr_locs.as_array
        try:
            result, _ = self.grouper.aggregate(
                block.values, how, axis=1, min_count=min_count
            )
        except NotImplementedError:
            if alt is not None:
                obj = self.obj[data.items[locs]]
                if obj.shape[1] == 1:
                    obj = obj.iloc[:, 0]
                s = get_groupby(obj, self.grouper)
                result = s.aggregate(lambda x: alt(x, axis=self.axis))
                result = cast(DataFrame, result)
        
        if result is not None:
            agg_block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(locs)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Rest of the function remains the same

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

This corrected version of the function aims to handle all potential scenarios for aggregation and should provide the expected output based on the given input parameters and data.
