        agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)

```

In the corrected version of the `_cython_agg_blocks` function, the issue with the TypeError when calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype has been resolved. This is achieved by explicitly handling the case where the datatype is Nullable Integer (Int) and converting it to a regular integer before performing the aggregation operation. Additionally, there is error handling for cases where the result is NaN to ensure that the block is excluded in such scenarios.
