Potential error location: It appears that the error may be occurring in the try-except block where the groupby object's aggregate method is called. The error may also be occurring when handling split object-dtype blocks.

Bug's cause:
The buggy function `_cython_agg_blocks` is intended to aggregate data using the `grouper` object. However, there are several complex conditions and exception handling within the function that may be causing unexpected behavior. Additionally, the handling of split object-dtype blocks and the reordering of items using the `indexer` variable may also introduce errors.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Simplify the conditional statements and exception handling within the function to reduce complexity and improve readability.
2. Ensure that the handling of split object-dtype blocks and reordering of items is done accurately.
3. Verify that the `grouper` object is functioning as expected and that the aggregation method is called with the correct arguments.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
    new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        result = self.grouper.aggregate(block.values, how, axis=0, min_count=min_count)

        if result is not None:
            agg_block: Block = block.make_block(result)
            new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    # Reorder items
    indexer = np.concatenate(new_items)
    agg_items = data.items.take(np.sort(indexer))
    
    # Reset the locs in the blocks to correspond to the current ordering
    offset = 0
    for blk in agg_blocks:
        loc = len(blk.mgr_locs)
        blk.mgr_locs = indexer[offset : (offset + loc)]
        offset += loc

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code, the try-except block is simplified and the result from the groupby object's aggregate method is checked for `None` instead of using exceptions. The reordering of items is also simplified and corrected.
