The buggy function is `_cython_agg_blocks` which is a member of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class in the `pandas/core/groupby/generic.py` file.

The potential error location within the function is likely in the loop where it calculates the result for each block. 

The bug is likely caused by the way the function is handling the aggregation and the result. There are discrepancies in the expected vs actual input/output variable values. For example, the `agg_blocks` list is being populated with the `agg_block` variable, but it's not entirely clear how `agg_block` is being generated.

To fix the bug, it may be necessary to review the aggregation process and the treatment of the result within the loop.

Here's a corrected version of the function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
        self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
    ) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
        data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

        if numeric_only:
            data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

        agg_blocks: List[Block] = []
        new_items: List[np.ndarray] = []
        
        for block in data.blocks:
            result = block._try_aggregate(how, min_count=min_count, numeric_only=numeric_only)
            if result is not None:
                agg_blocks.append(result)
                new_items.append(block.mgr_locs.as_array)

        if not agg_blocks:
            raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

        return agg_blocks, data.items.take(np.concatenate(new_items))
```
