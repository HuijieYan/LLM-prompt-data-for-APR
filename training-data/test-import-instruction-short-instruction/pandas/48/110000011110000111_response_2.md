Upon analyzing the buggy function and the failing test code, as well as the error message and the GitHub issue, it appears that the issue is related to the aggregation of nullable integer data with the `mean`, `median`, and `var` functions in a DataFrameGroupBy object.

The bug appears to be caused by inappropriate casting of data types when using the `mean`, `median`, and `var` functions on DataFrameGroupBy objects with nullable integer data.

To fix this bug, we need to ensure that the casting of data types is handled appropriately for nullable integer data when using these aggregation functions.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    # Existing code

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    # Existing code

    for block in data.blocks:
        # Existing code

        if result is not no_result:
            # Existing code

            if (
                result.dtype.kind in 'biufc'
                and block.dtype.kind in 'iu'
                and is_object_dtype(result.dtype)
                and not is_object_dtype(block.values)
            ):
                result = result.astype(block.values.dtype, copy=False)

            # Existing code

    # Existing code
```

The corrected code includes additional type checking and type casting to ensure that the result is appropriately cast to the original data type if needed.

By making these changes, the corrected function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub issue related to calling `mean` on a DataFrameGroupBy with nullable integer dtype.
