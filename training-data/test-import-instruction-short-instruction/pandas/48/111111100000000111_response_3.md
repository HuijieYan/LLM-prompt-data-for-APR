1. The problematic function `_cython_agg_blocks` is a member of the `DataFrameGroupBy` class. This class is a part of the pandas repository and is used for groupby operations on DataFrame objects.

2. The potential error location within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function could be related to the calculation of the mean for the nullable integer data type. The function contains several operations involving aggregation and type conversions, which could be causing the TypeError when mean is called on a DataFrameGroupBy with the Int64 dtype.

3. The cause of the bug can be attributed to how the `_cython_agg_blocks` function handles aggregation of numeric data, especially in cases where the data type is Int64. The GitHub issue further points out that the error occurs when calling mean, median, and std, indicating that the issue is specific to certain aggregation operations on nullable integer data.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Checking for compatibility and handling of nullable integer data type in the aggregation process within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function.
   - Ensuring that the calculation of the mean, median, and std for nullable integer data types is appropriately managed to avoid TypeErrors.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function `_cython_agg_blocks`:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.select_dtypes(include=np.number, exclude=[np.object])

    agg_blocks: List[Block] = []

    for block in data.blocks:
        if np.issubdtype(block.dtype, np.number) or block.dtype.name.startswith("Int"):
            agg_block = block.agg(how)
            agg_blocks.append(agg_block)

    if not agg_blocks:
        raise DataError("No numeric types to aggregate")

    return agg_blocks, data.items
```

This corrected code modifies the approach for aggregating numeric data within the `_cython_agg_blocks` function. It directly selects numeric data from the BlockManager, accounts for nullable integer data types, and applies the aggregation operation. This approach aims to resolve the TypeError when calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with the Int64 dtype, as reported in the GitHub issue.
