Based on the provided information, it seems that the bug in the `_cython_agg_blocks` function is related to the aggregation of data based on the `how` parameter, which determines the type of aggregation to be performed (e.g., mean, median, variance).

The issue seems to arise when performing the aggregation, as the returned result is not as expected, leading to incorrect values and types for the `agg_blocks` and `result` variables.

To fix the bug, the function may need to ensure that the aggregation logic is correctly implemented for different aggregation types, and that the returned values are properly handled and assigned to the `agg_blocks` variable.

Here's the corrected code for the `_cython_agg_blocks` function:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        data = data.get_numeric_data(copy=False)

    # Perform aggregation based on the 'how' parameter
    if how == 'mean':
        result = data._get_numeric_data().mean(axis=0, skipna=True, min_count=min_count)
    elif how == 'median':
        result = data._get_numeric_data().median(axis=0, skipna=True)
    elif how == 'var':
        result = data._get_numeric_data().var(axis=0, skipna=True, ddof=1, min_count=min_count)
    else:
        # Handle other aggregation types if needed
        result = None

    if result is None:
        raise ValueError("Invalid 'how' parameter for aggregation")

    # Create a FloatBlock for the aggregation result
    agg_block = data._simple_block(yielded=result, items=data.items)

    # Prepare the return values (agg_blocks and items)
    agg_blocks = [agg_block]
    agg_items = data.items

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

In the corrected code, the `how` parameter is used to determine the type of aggregation to be performed, and the result is directly calculated using the appropriate Pandas aggregation method. The result is then used to create a `FloatBlock` for the aggregation result, and the `agg_blocks` and `agg_items` are set accordingly.

This corrected code should address the issues observed in the buggy function and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
