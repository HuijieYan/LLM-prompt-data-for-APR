The bug seems to be related to the use of the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) in the `DataFrame`. This is causing a `TypeError` when calling the `mean` function after grouping.

Upon analyzing the function, it seems that the issue might be related to the handling of `Int64` dtype columns in the `pandas.core.groupby.generic.DataFrameGroupBy._cython_agg_blocks` function. The function is designed to handle aggregation on numeric data, but it seems that it is encountering an issue with the nullable integer data type.

The expected output for the GitHub issue is the mean of the 'b' column after grouping by the 'a' column. It should return:
```
   b
a     
0  1.5
1  3.5
2  5.5
3  7.5
```

To fix the bug, the function `_cython_agg_blocks` needs to be modified to handle the nullable integer data type (`Int64`) correctly during aggregation.

One approach for fixing the bug could involve updating the function to explicitly handle the nullable integer data type when computing aggregate functions such as mean, median, std, etc.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function that addresses this issue:

```python
def _cython_agg_blocks(
    self, how: str, alt=None, numeric_only: bool = True, min_count: int = -1
) -> "Tuple[List[Block], Index]":
    data: BlockManager = self._get_data_to_aggregate()

    if numeric_only:
        # Handle nullable integer data type
        data = data.convert_dtypes()

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...

    return agg_blocks, agg_items
```

The updated code includes a conversion to the nullable integer data type using the `convert_dtypes` method to handle the `Int64` dtype correctly during aggregation. This should resolve the issue and allow the function to properly handle the nullable integer data type.

This corrected code should address the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
