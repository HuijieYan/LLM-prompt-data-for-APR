1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a member of the `TimeGrouper` class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping. The function is used to calculate the time bin edges and labels for grouping a `DatetimeIndex` object. The most relevant input parameters include the `ax` (a `DatetimeIndex` object) and attributes of the `TimeGrouper` class, such as `self.freq`, `self.closed`, `self.base`, `self.label`, and `ax.tz`.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the calculation of the bins and labels, especially around the time of the clock change, as indicated by the GitHub issue related to AmbiguousTimeError.

3. The bug is caused by the handling of ambiguous timestamps during the clock change day in Cuba. The `_get_time_bins` function tries to create bins and labels for the time intervals, but it does not handle the ambiguous time properly, resulting in the AmbiguousTimeError.

The `TimeGrouper` class definition and related functions are working correctly based on the input values and variable types. The actual input/output variable values and the GitHub issue information indicate that the problem lies within the `_get_time_bins` function.

The discrepancy between the expected and actual output is evident in the GitHub issue, where the call to groupby raises an AmbiguousTimeError instead of correctly returning three groups for the specified days.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Handling ambiguous timestamps explicitly during the creation of bins and labels.
   - Adjusting the logic for creating bins and labels to account for the clock change day in Cuba.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function `_get_time_bins`:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",  # Specify handling of ambiguous times
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Calculate bins based on adjusted bin edges
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    # Label adjustments based on self.closed and self.label
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # Adjust labels if they exceed the number of bins
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code explicitly handles ambiguous times by specifying "NaT" as the ambiguous time resolution. This approach should help to resolve the bug and correctly handle the time intervals on the clock change day in Cuba.
