The issue seems to be with the calculation of the `binner` and `labels` values. The `date_range` function is used to generate the `binner` and `labels`, and then the `_adjust_bin_edges` function is called to further adjust them. However, it appears that the calculations for `binner` and `labels` are incorrect, leading to incorrect bin edges and labels.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the correct values are being used for generating `binner` and `labels`, and then make sure that the adjustments in the `_adjust_bin_edges` function are applied correctly.

It seems like the calculation for `bin_edges` is incorrect and is leading to incorrect `bins`. This may be due to the incorrect calculation of `first` and `last`.

To fix the bug, we should make sure that the `binner` and `labels` are generated using the correct `start` and `end` values, and also ensure that the adjustments in the `_adjust_bin_edges` function are applied correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = date_range(
        start=first, periods=len(ax) + 1, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name
    )
    
    labels = binner[1:]
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Re-calculate bins using the adjusted bin_edges
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
``` 

In this corrected code, the `date_range` function is used to generate `binner` and `labels` with the correct `start` and `end` values, and then the adjustments are applied using the `_adjust_bin_edges` function. Finally, the `bins` are re-calculated using the adjusted `bin_edges`.
