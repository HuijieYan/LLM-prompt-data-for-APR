1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the `TimeGrouper` class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping in the pandas library. The failing test is testing the functionality of this class by down-sampling a datetime index.

2. The potential error location within the `_get_time_bins` function is likely causing the `AmbiguousTimeError` during the down-sampling process.

3. The bug's cause is related to the handling of time bins and labels in the `_get_time_bins` function. The `date_range` function is being used to generate time bins and labels, and this is leading to an `AmbiguousTimeError` when the timestamps are at the end of daylight savings time (DST) due to repeated times.

4. To fix the bug, one approach could be to improve the handling of time bins and labels in the `_get_time_bins` function. Another approach could be to modify the down-sampling process to handle ambiguous times in a better way, ensuring that DST transitions are handled correctly.

5. Below is the corrected code for the problematic function `_get_time_bins`:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # GH #12037
    # use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code, the handling of time bins and labels has been improved, and the down-sampling process takes into account the possibility of ambiguous times during DST transitions. This should allow the function to pass the failing test.
