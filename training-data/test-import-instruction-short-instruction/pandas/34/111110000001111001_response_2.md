The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is intended to calculate time bins based on the input `ax` (a DatetimeIndex) and some other class properties. However, the function currently has several issues that are causing it to return incorrect results.

First, the `binner` and `labels` variables are being assigned the same value from the `date_range` function, which means they are identical. This is not the intended behavior, as `labels` should represent the edges of the time bins, while `binner` should be used to generate the bins. 

Second, the `labels` and `binner` variables are being adjusted and manipulated using conditions based on `self.closed` and `self.label`. However, the logic for adjusting `labels` and `binner` seems to be incorrect, and it is leading to incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the logic for generating `binner` and `labels` should be revised to correctly represent the edges of the time bins and the bins themselves. Additionally, the adjustments made to `labels` and `binner` based on `self.closed` and `self.label` should be reviewed and corrected as necessary.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base)
    binner = date_range(freq=self.freq, start=first, end=last, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name, ambiguous="infer", nonexistent="shift_forward")

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans)

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
    
    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected code revises the logic for generating `binner` and `labels` and adjusts the `labels` and `binner` based on `self.closed` and `self.label` as per the intended behavior.
