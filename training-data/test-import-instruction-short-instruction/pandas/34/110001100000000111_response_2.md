1. The buggy function is supposed to handle grouping with a daily frequency. It relies on the _get_timestamp_range_edges function to calculate the first and last timestamps, and then creates bins based on these timestamps. The issue described in the GitHub post is related to a clock change in Cuba causing an AmbiguousTimeError.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the calculation of the first and last timestamps, as this is where the time zone conversion and handling of ambiguous timestamps would occur.

3. The bug's cause is likely due to the function not handling ambiguous timestamps correctly, which leads to the AmbiguousTimeError. This cause is identified by:
   (a). The buggy function attempts to calculate the first and last timestamps without considering ambiguous times.
   (b). The related functions may not properly handle ambiguous timestamps or time zone changes.
   (c). The GitHub issue clearly describes how a clock change in Cuba causes an AmbiguousTimeError, indicating a problem with the handling of timestamps.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   (a). Adding logic to handle ambiguous times when calculating the first and last timestamps.
   (b). Ensuring that time zone changes are properly accounted for when creating bins.
   (c). Modifying the related functions to handle ambiguous timestamps more effectively.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    # Adjust for ambiguous times and time zone changes
    first = first.tz_localize(ax.tz)
    last = last.tz_localize(ax.tz)

    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )
    
    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Rest of the code remains the same
```

This corrected code includes handling of ambiguous times and time zone changes when calculating the first and last timestamps, which should address the issue described in the GitHub post.
