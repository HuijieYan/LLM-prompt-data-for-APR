1. The buggy function is a method called '_get_time_bins' in the 'pandas/core/resample.py' file. This function is part of the pandas library and is used for grouping time series data. The function calls other related functions such as '_get_timestamp_range_edges' and '_adjust_bin_edges' within the same file.

The related GitHub issue describes a problem with grouping time series data with a daily frequency, which fails with an AmbiguousTimeError on a clock change day in Cuba. The issue is related to how pandas handles ambiguous timestamps when grouping data.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the calculation of 'binner' and 'labels' based on the frequency and timestamp range. It seems that the handling of ambiguous timestamps and time zone conversion is not performed correctly.

3. The bug's cause can be elucidated using the following information:
   (a). The '_get_time_bins' function attempts to create bins and labels for grouping time series data based on the frequency, start, and end timestamp.
   (b). The related functions '_get_timestamp_range_edges' and '_adjust_bin_edges' are called to calculate the timestamp range edges and adjust the bin edges, respectively.
   (c). The GitHub Issue information describes that the problem arises on a clock change day in Cuba, where midnight local time is an ambiguous timestamp, leading to an AmbiguousTimeError when grouping data based on daily frequency.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check for ambiguous timestamps and handle them appropriately, possibly by adding logic to detect and resolve ambiguous timestamps when creating the bins and labels.
   - Ensure correct time zone conversion and handling of local time changes, especially when creating bins and labels for daily grouping.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
from pandas.tseries.frequencies import to_offset

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first = ax.min()
    last = ax.max()

    offset = to_offset(self.freq)

    bins = date_range(start=first, end=last, freq=offset, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name, ambiguous="infer", nonexistent="shift_forward")

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = bins
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        bins = bins.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    return bins, labels
```
This corrected code attempts to address the issue by simplifying the logic for creating bins and labels based on the frequency and timestamp range. It also ensures appropriate handling of ambiguous timestamps and NaN values while creating the bins. Additionally, time zone conversion and handling of local time changes are taken into account.
