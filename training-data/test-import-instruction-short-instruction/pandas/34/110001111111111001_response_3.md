The issue in the buggy function seems to be related to the handling of time zone changes, specifically around the transition from standard time to daylight saving time. This transition can introduce ambiguous times, which the function currently fails to handle correctly.

From the failing test and the error message, we can see that the bug is related to ambiguous time error at the transition from standard time to daylight saving time.

The problematic function `_get_time_bins` is used to calculate bin edges for time series data at a particular frequency. In this case, the function is creating bins based on daily frequency. However, when transitioning from standard time to daylight saving time, there are ambiguous times, and the function does not handle this correctly.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the `_get_time_bins` function to handle ambiguous times more accurately.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to use a different method of creating the bins that properly accounts for the ambiguous times. We can use the `DatetimeIndex` object's `shift` method to adjust the bin edges based on the timezone information, which can handle the transition from standard time to daylight saving time correctly.

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    bin_edges = binner.shift(1, freq=self.freq)

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

By adjusting the bin edges using the `shift` method and specifying the appropriate handling of ambiguous and nonexistent times, we can ensure that the bin edges are calculated correctly, and the error related to ambiguous times should be resolved.

This corrected function should now pass the failing test case and handle the ambiguous time error correctly.
