1. The buggy function is designed to group a pandas DataFrame by a daily frequency using the DateGrouper. The failing test case involves a situation where there is an ambiguous time on a clock-change day in Cuba, resulting in an AmbiguousTimeError. The function is failing to handle this scenario properly.

2. The potential error location in the problematic function seems to be in the calculation of labels and bins, which is causing an AmbiguousTimeError.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a) The buggy function is not handling the scenario of an ambiguous time on a clock-change day, leading to an AmbiguousTimeError.
   (b) The failing test is triggering the function with a specific scenario involving an ambiguous time.
   (c) The expected input/output variable information indicates that the labels and bins are not being calculated correctly, leading to an ambiguous time error.
   (d) The GitHub issue provides context on the specific situation in which the bug occurs and the expected behavior.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a) Handle ambiguous times explicitly in the function by adjusting the way labels and bins are calculated for time bins that fall on clock-change days.
   (b) Update the function to account for ambiguous times and prevent the ambiguous time error from being raised.
   (c) Validate the time binning logic to ensure it handles ambiguous times correctly, especially on clock-change days.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pandas import DatetimeIndex, Timestamp, date_range

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # Use first/last directly instead of call replace() on them
    # because replace() will swallow the nanosecond part
    # thus last bin maybe slightly before the end if the end contains
    # nanosecond part and lead to `Values falls after last bin` error
    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected function takes into account ambiguous times and should handle the specific scenario described in the failing test case and GitHub issue. It should prevent the AmbiguousTimeError from being raised in the given situation.
