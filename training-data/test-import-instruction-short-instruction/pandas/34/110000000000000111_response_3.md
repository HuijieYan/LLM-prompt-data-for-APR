1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is related to the GitHub issue because it is used in the `pd.Grouper` function, which is causing an AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba. The function is responsible for generating time bins based on the input axis. The issue arises due to the handling of ambiguous timestamps when creating the time bins.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the generation of time bins using the `date_range` function. This is evident from the GitHub issue where the user expects the call to `groupby` to return three groups, but it raises an AmbiguousTimeError.

3. (a). The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is responsible for generating time bins based on the input axis using the `date_range` function. The use of `date_range` to create time bins is directly related to the issue mentioned in the GitHub post, as it does not handle ambiguous timestamps correctly.

   (b). The GitHub issue highlights the specific problem of AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba. The user expects the call to `groupby` to return groups based on days, but due to the incorrect handling of ambiguous timestamps, it raises an error.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Properly handling ambiguous timestamps when creating time bins using the `date_range` function.
   - Adjusting the logic for generating time bins to account for potential issues related to ambiguous timestamps.
   - Maybe using an alternative method for creating time bins that handles ambiguous timestamps more effectively.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    bin_edges = np.concatenate((ax_values, [ax_values[-1] + self.freq]))
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=ax[0],
        periods=len(bins),
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    if ax.hasnans:
        bins = np.insert(bins, 0, np.nan)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    return ax, bins, labels
```

This corrected code handles the generation of time bins more effectively, ensuring proper handling of ambiguous timestamps. It uses an alternative method for creating time bins that eliminates the issue of AmbiguousTimeError on clock change day in Cuba.
