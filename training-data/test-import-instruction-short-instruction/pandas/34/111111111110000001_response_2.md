1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is a method of the `TimeGrouper` class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping in the pandas library. The error message is related to a `pytz.AmbiguousTimeError` in the `date_range` method call within the `_get_time_bins` function. This error suggests that the function is failing to handle ambiguous times when creating the date range.

2. The potential error location within the `_get_time_bins` function is likely the `date_range` method call where the `ambiguous="infer"` parameter is specified. This parameter is used to infer dst time from the provided date range, and it's likely that it is not handling ambiguous times correctly, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError`.

3. (a) The buggy class `TimeGrouper` contains the `_get_time_bins` function, where the issue is located.
   (b) The related functions are `_get_timestamp_range_edges`, `ax`, and `_adjust_bin_edges`, which are also called within the `TimeGrouper` class.
   (c) The failing test calls the `groupby` method on a DataFrame with a `Grouper` instance created with a frequency of "1D". This eventually leads to the `_get_time_bins` method call, where the `AmbiguousTimeError` is raised.
   (d) The error message indicates that there are no repeated times, which suggests that the function is not handling ambiguous times properly.

4. To fix the bug, the `_get_time_bins` function may need to handle ambiguous times more effectively. This could involve modifying the parameters passed to the `date_range` method or using a different approach to handle ambiguous times.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
from pandas import DatetimeIndex, date_range, NaT

# ...

# Corrected _get_time_bins function
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    # Use `normalize=True` to handle ambiguous times
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first, end=last, freq=self.freq, tz=ax.tz, name=ax.name, normalize=True
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected version, the `normalize=True` parameter is used in the `date_range` method to handle ambiguous times. By adding this parameter, the function should be able to handle the ambiguous times correctly and pass the failing test.
