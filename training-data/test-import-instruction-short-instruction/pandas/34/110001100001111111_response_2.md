The issue seems to be related to handling ambiguous timestamps on clock change days, particularly in Cuba, while using the pd.Grouper function. The buggy function in the pandas repository seems to be causing an AmbiguousTimeError in this scenario due to incorrect handling of time bins and labels.

From the runtime value and type of variables right before the buggy function's return, it appears that the error might be occurring during the creation of time bins and labels, especially with the handling of the ambiguous timestamp on the clock change day in Cuba.

To fix this issue, the correction should involve handling the ambiguous timestamp correctly when creating the time bins and labels to ensure that the code does not raise an AmbiguousTimeError. The correction should also consider the GitHub issue related to this bug, which provides a clear description of the expected behavior.

One possible approach to fixing the bug would be to handle the ambiguous time explicitly within the `_get_time_bins` function. This can be done by using the tz_localize method before applying the offset. Additionally, the logic for creating time bins and labels needs to ensure that the ambiguous timestamp is handled correctly.

Here's the corrected version of the _get_time_bins function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    # Handle ambiguous timestamps explicitly
    first = first.tz_localize(None)
    last = last.tz_localize(None)

    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first.tz_localize(ax.tz),  # Handle ambiguous timestamp
        end=last.tz_localize(ax.tz),  # Handle ambiguous timestamp
        freq=self.freq,
        name=ax.name,
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Rest of the code remains the same

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version explicitly handles the ambiguous timestamps and should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
