1. The problematic function `_get_time_bins` is used in the failing test `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` from the file `pandas/tests/resample/test_datetime_index.py`. The error message is related to an `AmbiguousTimeError` which is raised due to the incorrect usage of `tz_localize` and `tz_convert` functions.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of `binner = labels = date_range()` which leads to ambiguity in the time range and causes the error.

3. (a). The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is used to generate time bins based on frequency and time values.
   (b). In the failing test, a groupby operation is performed on the dataframe using a frequency of 1 day (`freq="1D"`), which triggers the invocation of the `_get_time_bins` function. The error message indicates that an `AmbiguousTimeError` is being raised, which is caused by the incorrect inference of daylight saving time at midnight.

4. To fix the bug, the `tz_localize` and `tz_convert` functions should be used in a way that ensures unambiguous time inference. Additionally, the use of `date_range` needs to be revised to avoid ambiguity in time representation.

5. The corrected code for the problematic function `_get_time_bins` is as follows:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    ax = ax.tz_convert("UTC")  # Convert to UTC timezone
    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    binner = labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT",  # Set ambiguous parameter to NaT to handle ambiguous time
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # remaining code
    # ...

    return binner, bins, labels
```

With these changes, the corrected function ensures that time inference is unambiguous and handles daylight saving time appropriately. This should resolve the `AmbiguousTimeError` and make the function pass the failing test.
