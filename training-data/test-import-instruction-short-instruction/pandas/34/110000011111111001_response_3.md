The potential error in the function is originating from the incorrect setup of bin labels and bin edges which are causing issues with daylight saving time when converting between time zones.

The failing test is trying to downsample the data by finding the mean of the values for every day. However, when converting between time zones, there are ambiguous times introduced due to daylight saving time. This leads to an error when the time bins are being created in the `_get_time_bins` function.

To fix this issue, the bin labels and bin edges need to be adjusted to account for daylight saving time. Additionally, the conversion between time zones should be handled in a way that avoids ambiguous times.

A possible approach to fixing the bug would be to modify how the bin labels and bin edges are created. Instead of directly using the `date_range` function, a custom method should be implemented to handle edge cases with daylight saving time. Additionally, handling of the time zone conversion should be adjusted to avoid ambiguous times.

Here's the corrected code for the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
from pandas.tseries.frequencies import to_offset

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    # Adjust bin edges to handle daylight saving time
    extra_offset = to_offset('1ms')
    first = ax.min() - extra_offset
    last = ax.max() + 2 * extra_offset

    binner, labels = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # Rest of the function remains the same
    ...
```

By adjusting the bin edges to handle potential issues with daylight saving time and making sure the time zone conversion handles ambiguous times appropriately, the corrected function should now pass the failing test without the error.
