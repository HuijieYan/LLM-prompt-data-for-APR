The issue in the `pandas` code seems to be related to handling ambiguous time during a clock change in Cuba. The bug seems to be in the `_get_time_bins` function of the `TimeGrouper` class in the `pandas/core/resample.py` file. 

To fix the bug, we need to handle the ambiguous time during the clock change more carefully. This will involve updating the date_range creation and handling as well as ensuring appropriate labels and bins are generated for the groups.

Here's the corrected version of the `_get_time_bins` function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    ax = ax.sort_values()
    start = ax[0].normalize()
    end = ax[-1].normalize() + timedelta(days=1)
    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=start,
        end=end,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        normalize=True,
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right":
        labels = binner
        if self.label == "right":
            labels = labels[1:]
    elif self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    # if we end up with more labels than bins
    # adjust the labels
    # GH4076
    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[: len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

This corrected version takes into account the sorted values of the input datetime index `ax`, handles ambiguous time by inferring it in the `date_range` creation, and correctly adjusts labels and bins to handle the ambiguity.

Please note that this code should be tested thoroughly to ensure it resolves the issue described in the failing test and associated GitHub issue.
