1. The buggy function is part of the TimeGrouper class, which is a custom groupby class for time-interval grouping. The function _get_time_bins is responsible for generating time bins for a given axis, and it calls the _adjust_bin_edges function along with other related functions to achieve this.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be in the calculations related to generating the time bins, as it involves date ranges, bin edges, and labels.

3. The bug's cause could be related to incorrect calculations or logic when generating the time bins, handling labels, or dealing with nanoseconds. This could result in incorrect or incomplete time bins being generated.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include:
   - Reviewing the calculations and logic related to generating time bins, ensuring they are accurate and handle edge cases properly.
   - Checking the logic for handling labels and nanoseconds to ensure they are being handled correctly.
   - Verifying the interactions with the _adjust_bin_edges function and ensuring that the bin edges are adjusted correctly.

5. Corrected code for the _get_time_bins function:

```python
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = labels = date_range(
        start=first,
        end=last,
        freq=self.freq,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    if self.closed == "right" or self.label == "right":
        labels = labels[1:]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    if len(bins) < len(labels):
        labels = labels[:len(bins)]

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code, the generation of date_range is adjusted, and the logic for handling labels and nanoseconds is modified. Additionally, adjustments are made to ensure the labels match the bins in length.
