The issue in the buggy function is that it is not handling the ambiguous timestamp correctly, which leads to the AmbiguousTimeError as reported in the GitHub issue. The problem arises specifically because of the transition from daylight saving time in Cuba on the clock change day.

The bug in the function is due to the inconsistency in handling the transition and the label generation for the bins.

To fix this bug, the function needs to handle the ambiguous timestamp correctly and generate the labels accordingly. The labels for the bins should reflect the local time before and after the transition.

The corrected code for the function is as follows:

```python
# The corrected function
def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    if not isinstance(ax, DatetimeIndex):
        raise TypeError(
            "axis must be a DatetimeIndex, but got "
            f"an instance of {type(ax).__name__}"
        )

    if len(ax) == 0:
        binner = labels = DatetimeIndex(data=[], freq=self.freq, name=ax.name)
        return binner, [], labels

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="infer",
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )

    ax_values = ax.asi8
    binner, bin_edges = self._adjust_bin_edges(binner, ax_values)

    # general version, knowing nothing about relative frequencies
    bins = lib.generate_bins_dt64(
        ax_values, bin_edges, self.closed, hasnans=ax.hasnans
    )

    labels = bin_edges[:-1]

    if ax.hasnans:
        binner = binner.insert(0, NaT)
        labels = labels.insert(0, NaT)

    return binner, bins, labels
```

In the corrected code, the labels are generated from the bin_edges, and the handling of ambiguous time is improved. This correction should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub post.
