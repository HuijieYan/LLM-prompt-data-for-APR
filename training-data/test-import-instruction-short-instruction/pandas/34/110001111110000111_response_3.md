1. The buggy function `_get_time_bins` is part of the pandas `core/resample.py` file. It is called by the `groupby` method in the failing test function `test_downsample_dst_at_midnight` in the `pandas/tests/resample/test_datetime_index.py` file. The error message indicates an `AmbiguousTimeError` due to a long clock-change day in Cuba.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the usage of `date_range` to create `binner` and `labels` without considering the ambiguous time issue on the clock-change day.

3. The bug is caused because the `date_range` function used within the `_get_time_bins` function does not handle the ambiguous time issue on the clock-change day, leading to the `AmbiguousTimeError` during the `groupby` operation. The failing test provided demonstrates this issue by attempting to perform a `groupby` operation on a DataFrame containing timestamps on the day of the clock change in Cuba.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Adjusting the `date_range` function usage to handle ambiguous time on clock-change days, possibly by using the `partial` parameter to handle the ambiguous time.
   - Handling the ambiguous time scenario within the `_get_time_bins` function to create `binner` and `labels` by appropriately adjusting the date range creation.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from pandas import DatetimeIndex, date_range, NaT

def _get_time_bins(self, ax):
    # existing code...

    first, last = _get_timestamp_range_edges(
        ax.min(), ax.max(), self.freq, closed=self.closed, base=self.base
    )
    
    # Handle the ambiguous time issue on the clock-change day
    if ax.max().to_datetime64() - ax.min().to_datetime64() == pd.Timedelta(hours=24):
        last = last - pd.Timedelta(seconds=1)

    binner = date_range(
        freq=self.freq,
        start=first,
        end=last,
        tz=ax.tz,
        name=ax.name,
        ambiguous="NaT", # Adjust ambiguous handling
        nonexistent="shift_forward",
    )
    
    # existing code...
```

The corrected code handles the ambiguous time issue on the clock-change day by adjusting the `last` timestamp to be one second before the actual end time. Additionally, the `ambiguous` parameter is set to "NaT" to handle ambiguous times by inserting `NaT` where ambiguity is encountered.

With these corrections, the function should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub thread.
