The bug in the `get_indexer` function seems to be occurring due to an issue with the `target_as_index` variable. The error message indicates that there is a `TypeError: No matching signature found` when trying to get the indexer for `target_as_index.values`. This suggests that the data type or format of `target_as_index.values` is not matching the expected type for the `get_indexer` function.

Upon analyzing the function and the failing test, it seems that the issue might be related to how the `target_as_index` variable is being handled for certain input types. The function contains conditional statements for different types of input for `target_as_index`, and it's possible that the handling of `target_as_index.values` in these conditional statements is causing the error.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that the `target_as_index.values` variable is being processed correctly for all possible input types. One possible approach would be to check the data type of `target_as_index` and handle the `target_as_index.values` accordingly.

Here's a corrected version of the `get_indexer` function that should pass the failing test and resolve the issue:

```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        # Handle IntervalIndex
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        else:
            indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
            return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
    else:
        # For other index types
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index)
        return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

In this corrected version, we are directly using `self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)` for `IntervalIndex`, while for other index types, we are using `self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index)` to process the `target_as_index` values.

With this correction, the `get_indexer` function should be able to handle different types of input correctly and pass the failing test.
