Potential Error Location:
The potential error is most likely in the conditional check for overlapping indices and the subsequent handling of the different cases.

Bug's Cause:
The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of the target index when it is of type IntervalIndex. The function is not properly checking for overlapping indices and is not handling the cases where the indices are not equal or have different properties.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the conditional check for overlapping indices to correctly handle the different cases.
2. Update the handling of the target index when it is of type IntervalIndex to properly handle cases where the indices are not equal or have different properties.

Corrected Code:
```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():  # fixed the condition to call the method
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, IntervalIndex):
        if self.equals(target_as_index):
            return np.arange(len(self), dtype="intp")
        elif self.closed != target_as_index.closed or self.dtype.subtype != target_as_index.dtype.subtype:  # compare subtype
            return np.repeat(np.intp(-1), len(target_as_index))
        else:
            left_indexer = self.left.get_indexer(target_as_index.left)
            right_indexer = self.right.get_indexer(target_as_index.right)
            indexer = np.where(left_indexer == right_indexer, left_indexer, -1)
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        indexer = np.array([self.get_loc(key) if key in self else -1 for key in target_as_index])

    return indexer
```
In the corrected code:
1. The `is_overlapping()` method is properly called with parentheses to check for overlapping indices.
2. A conditional check is added to properly handle cases where the indices are not equal or have different properties when the input target is of type IntervalIndex.
3. Proper comparison of the subtype is performed to handle cases where the indices have different subtypes.
