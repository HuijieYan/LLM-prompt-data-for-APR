### Analysis

The buggy function `get_indexer` is part of the `IntervalIndex` class and is used to compute the indexer for a given target. The function checks if the `IntervalIndex` has overlapping indices and then proceeds to handle the computation based on the type of the target index.

The GitHub issue mentions that the `round` method fails when columns are `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`. This indicates that there is a problem with the computation of the indexer, which is likely causing the `round` method to fail when dealing with `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`.

Looking at the runtime values and types of the input parameters and variables at the function's return, it seems that the computation of the indexer may not be handling the target index properly.

### Bug Cause

The bug may be caused by the incorrect handling of `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex` in the computation of the indexer. The function may not be appropriately identifying the type of the target index and performing the necessary computations.

### Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug

1. Check the computation logic for the indexer and ensure that it correctly handles `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex`.
2. Verify the logic for identifying the type of the target index and make any necessary adjustments to handle `CategoricalIndex` appropriately.
3. Ensure that the computation of the indexer results in the expected output for different types of target indices.

### Corrected Code

```python
# Corrected get_indexer function
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping:
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    if isinstance(target_as_index, (IntervalIndex, CategoricalIndex)):
        # Handle IntervalIndex and CategoricalIndex
        indexer = np.arange(len(target_as_index), dtype="intp")
    elif not is_object_dtype(target_as_index):
        # Handle other types of indices
        target_as_index = self._maybe_convert_i8(target_as_index)
        indexer = self._engine.get_indexer(target_as_index.values)
    else:
        # Handle heterogeneous scalar index
        indexer = np.array([self.get_loc(key) for key in target_as_index])

    return ensure_platform_int(indexer)
```

With the corrected code, the `get_indexer` function now appropriately handles `CategoricalIndex` created from an `IntervalIndex` by treating them the same as `IntervalIndex` in the computation of the indexer. This should resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub post.
