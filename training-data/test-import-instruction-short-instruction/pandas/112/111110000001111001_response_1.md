The bug is likely caused by the comparison `if self.is_overlapping:`. Since `is_overlapping` is a method, this condition will always evaluate to `True` regardless of its actual functionality. This causes the code to always raise an `InvalidIndexError`, even when it's not necessary.

To fix the bug, we need to call the `is_overlapping` method to obtain its result and then proceed accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    # rest of the function remains unchanged
```

By making this change, the function should now correctly check for overlapping indices and handle them accordingly, fixing the bug.
