# Problem identified
The bug seems to be in the conditional check `if self.is_overlapping:`. Here, `self.is_overlapping` is a function, so the correct way to call it and check its return value is `if self.is_overlapping():`. It seems that the intention was to check if the function returns `True` or `False`, but the current implementation just checks if the function object exists, which is always true. Therefore, the correct way to correct this is to call the function and check its return value.

# Corrected code
```python
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():  # Call the function
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
```

With this correction, the function should properly check if `self.is_overlapping()` returns `True` or `False`, and the code should work as intended.
