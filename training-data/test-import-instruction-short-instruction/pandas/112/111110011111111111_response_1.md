The problem lies in the `get_indexer` method of the `IntervalIndex` class. The error message indicates a TypeError related to the signature of the function, which suggests that there might be an issue with the function signature.

The failing test creates a DataFrame with columns as a `CategoricalIndex` made from an `IntervalIndex` and then calls the `round` method on it, which internally calls the `get_indexer` method. This leads to the TypeError with no matching signature found.

The problem may stem from the fact that the `get_indexer` function is not handling the `CategoricalIndex` properly, which causes the TypeError when trying to round the DataFrame.

To fix the bug, the `get_indexer` method needs to be modified to handle the `CategoricalIndex` case more effectively, so that the 'round' function can work properly. Additionally, any issues with function signatures should be addressed.

Here's the corrected code for the `get_indexer` method:

```python
def get_indexer(self, target: AnyArrayLike, method: Optional[str] = None, limit: Optional[int] = None, tolerance: Optional[Any] = None) -> np.ndarray:
    self._check_method(method)

    if isinstance(target, pd.CategoricalIndex):
        target = target.categories

    # rest of the code remains as it is
    # ...
```
This modification first checks if the target is a `pd.CategoricalIndex`. If it is, it extracts the categories from the `CategoricalIndex`. This change should resolve the TypeError related to the signature mismatch and enable the `round` method to work properly.

With this modification, the failing test should pass, and the bug described in the GitHub issue should also be resolved.
