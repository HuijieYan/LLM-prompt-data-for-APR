Potential error location: 

The bug may be caused by the conditional statement `if self.is_overlapping`. The intention of this conditional statement appears to be to check whether the `self` object overlaps with a target interval index. However, it seems that this should actually be a method call `if self.is_overlapping()`, as `is_overlapping` is not a property, but a method on the `IntervalIndex` class.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

1. Use the correct method call to check for overlapping indices: `if self.is_overlapping()`.
2. If the `is_overlapping` method should be returning a boolean, make sure it does so correctly. If it doesn't, then the logic inside this method should be adjusted accordingly.

Corrected code:

```python
# this is the corrected version of the buggy function
@Substitution(
    **dict(
        _index_doc_kwargs,
        **{
            "raises_section": textwrap.dedent(
                """
    Raises
    ------
    NotImplementedError
        If any method argument other than the default of
        None is specified as these are not yet implemented.
    """
            )
        },
    )
)
@Appender(_index_shared_docs["get_indexer"])
def get_indexer(
    self,
    target: AnyArrayLike,
    method: Optional[str] = None,
    limit: Optional[int] = None,
    tolerance: Optional[Any] = None,
) -> np.ndarray:

    self._check_method(method)

    if self.is_overlapping():
        msg = (
            "cannot handle overlapping indices; use "
            "IntervalIndex.get_indexer_non_unique"
        )
        raise InvalidIndexError(msg)

    target_as_index = ensure_index(target)

    # Rest of the function remains unchanged...
```
In the corrected code, the conditional statement `if self.is_overlapping()` is used to call the `is_overlapping` method and check if the indices overlap. Additionally, any necessary changes to the `is_overlapping` method itself should also be made to ensure it returns the correct boolean value.
