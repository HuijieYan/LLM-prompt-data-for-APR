1. The buggy function is a part of the pandas repository and is related to the issue where the MultiIndexed unstack with tuple names fails with KeyError. The function is designed to unstack a MultiIndexed DataFrame or Series based on a given level, but it has some bugs that lead to the KeyError in the GitHub issue.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the section that deals with extracting the level number from the index using the `_get_level_number` function.

3. The bug in this function causes a KeyError during the operation of unstacking a MultiIndexed DataFrame or Series. This is linked to the fact that the `_get_level_number` function is unable to correctly handle tuple names in the MultiIndex, leading to the KeyError. The issue in GitHub presents an example where the unstack operation fails due to the level names not being found.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a) Modify the `_get_level_number` function to handle tuple names in the MultiIndex correctly.
   (b) Ensure that the unstack operation accounts for tuple names and is able to process them without causing KeyErrors.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # NOTE: This doesn't deal with hierarchical columns yet

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, (tuple, list)) else index._get_level_number([i]) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]
    
    # Rest of the function remains unchanged
    # ...
```

In the corrected code, the `_get_level_number` function is modified to handle tuple names in the MultiIndex by checking if the input is a tuple or list, and then calling the `_get_level_number` function accordingly. This modification ensures that the function can correctly extract the level numbers for both tuple and non-tuple names, addressing the issue raised in the GitHub bug report.
