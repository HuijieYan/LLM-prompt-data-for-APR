The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is designed to unstack a MultiIndexed data according to the specified levels. However, it fails to do so and results in a KeyError, as reported in the GitHub issue.

### Problematic function location
The root cause of the issue appears to be the way the function is handling the input `clocs`. The function's logic for unstacking the given MultiIndex seems to have issues, resulting in incorrect restructuring of the data.

### Bug Cause
The function has inconsistencies in handling the input `clocs` and logic for unstacking the MultiIndex, resulting in a KeyError. This is evident from the fact that the levels expected to be present in the index are not recognized, leading to incorrect outcomes.

### Suggestions for Fixing the Bug
1. Modify the way the function processes the `clocs` input to ensure that it correctly identifies the specified levels in the MultiIndex.
2. Adjust the logic for unstacking the MultiIndex to accurately restructure the data as expected.
3. Verify the integrity of the resulting data structure to ensure that it aligns with the provided MultiIndex and input DataFrame.

### Corrected Code
After analyzing the issue and the expected values, here's the corrected version of the `_unstack_multiple` function that should resolve the problem:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    unstacked = data.unstack(clocs)

    return unstacked
```

This corrected function should now accurately unstack the MultiIndex according to the levels specified in the `clocs` input.

With these corrections in place, the function should now align with the expected behavior and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
