The bug is caused by the `_get_level_number` function in the MultiIndex class, which is used in the `_unstack_multiple` function. The error message indicates that the function is unable to find the level 'A'.

The bug seems to stem from the way the level is being handled in the `_unstack_multiple` function. It is likely that the tuple names in the MultiIndex are not being handled correctly.

To fix this bug, the handling of tuple names in the MultiIndex needs to be modified in the `_unstack_multiple` function.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    if rlocs == []:
        unstacked = data.unstack(fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        unstacked = data.unstack(list(clocs), fill_value=fill_value)

    return unstacked
```

By modifying the unstacking process to directly use the `unstack` method available for the DataFrame and Series objects, we can avoid the issue of handling hierarchical columns and tuple names in the MultiIndex.

This corrected function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
