1. The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is related to the GitHub issue "MultiIndexed unstack with tuple names fails with KeyError" as it is involved in the process of unstacking a MultiIndex. The function deals with unstacking a MultiIndex and handling hierarchical columns.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function appears to be in the initial part of the function where it is attempting to obtain the index level numbers. The error seems to be related to the handling of hierarchical index levels.

3. The bug's cause is related to the handling of MultiIndex names and level numbers. The issue on GitHub demonstrates an attempt to unstack a MultiIndex using tuple names ('A', 'a') which results in a KeyError. This aligns with the error in the function where it fails to identify the level "A".

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include properly handling the MultiIndex names and level numbers, ensuring that the function can handle tuples as index names when unstacking the data. Additionally, the function should be able to correctly identify and address the hierarchical nature of the columns.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if isinstance(data, pd.Series) or isinstance(data.columns, pd.MultiIndex):
        return data.unstack(clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
    else:
        return data.unstack(level=clocs, fill_value=fill_value)
```

This corrected code simplifies the logic inside the function, leveraging the existing unstack method from the pandas library to handle both Series and DataFrame objects. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug and provide a more concise and effective implementation for unstacking MultiIndexed data.
