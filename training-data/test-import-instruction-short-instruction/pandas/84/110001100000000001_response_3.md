1. The buggy function `_unstack_multiple` is trying to unstack a multi-index DataFrame or Series. It makes use of the `unstack` function and other related functions to accomplish this.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function could be the logic for handling the unstack operation for both Series and DataFrame, especially where new_levels, new_names, and new_codes are determined.

3. The bug's cause appears to be related to incorrect handling of the unstack operation for both Series and DataFrame, as well as the creation of new_levels, new_names, and new_codes. This causes unexpected behavior when unstacking the data and creating a new index.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Clearly differentiate the logic for handling unstack operation for Series and DataFrame.
   b. Double check the creation of new_levels, new_names, and new_codes to ensure they are being formed correctly.

5. Corrected code:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]

    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    clevels = [index.levels[i] for i in clocs]
    ccodes = [index.codes[i] for i in clocs]
    cnames = [index.names[i] for i in clocs]
    rlevels = [index.levels[i] for i in rlocs]
    rcodes = [index.codes[i] for i in rlocs]
    rnames = [index.names[i] for i in rlocs]

    shape = [len(x) for x in clevels]
    group_index = get_group_index(ccodes, shape, sort=False, xnull=False)

    comp_ids, obs_ids = compress_group_index(group_index, sort=False)
    recons_codes = decons_obs_group_ids(comp_ids, obs_ids, shape, ccodes, xnull=False)

    if rlocs == []:
        # Everything is in clocs, so the dummy df has a regular index
        dummy_index = Index(obs_ids, name="__placeholder__")
    else:
        dummy_index = MultiIndex(
            levels=rlevels + [obs_ids],
            codes=rcodes + [comp_ids],
            names=rnames + ["__placeholder__"],
            verify_integrity=False,
        )

    if isinstance(data, Series):
        dummy = data.copy()
        dummy.index = dummy_index

        unstacked = dummy.unstack("__placeholder__", fill_value=fill_value)
        new_levels = clevels
        new_names = cnames
        new_codes = recons_codes
        new_columns = MultiIndex(
            levels=new_levels, codes=new_codes, names=new_names, verify_integrity=False
        )
        unstacked.index = new_columns
    else:
        result = data
        for i in range(len(clocs)):
            val = clocs[i]
            result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
            clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]
        unstacked = result

    return unstacked
```
