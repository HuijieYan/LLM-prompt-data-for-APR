The bug in the `_unstack_multiple` function seems to be caused by incorrect manipulation of the index and columns during the unstacking process. The function is designed to handle multi-level indices and columns, but the manipulation of these multi-level structures is not being handled correctly.

The function is trying to handle the multiple levels of the index and columns, but it's not doing so consistently. It is failing to correctly handle the reorganization of the index and columns when unstacking the data.

To fix the bug, the following approaches can be considered:

1. Ensure that the manipulation of the index and columns is consistent and correct throughout the function.

2. Handle the hierarchical columns and index properly when unstacking the data.

3. Consider refactoring the code to make it more readable and easier to understand, which could help in identifying and resolving the issue.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    # Reorganize the codes and levels of the index
    index = data.index
    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) for i in clocs]
    rlocs = [i for i in range(index.nlevels) if i not in clocs]

    # Handle hierarchical columns
    if isinstance(data.columns, MultiIndex):
        # If the columns are multi-level, unstack them using each level in clocs
        result = data
        for i in range(len(clocs)):
            val = clocs[i]
            result = result.unstack(val, fill_value=fill_value)
            clocs = [v if i > v else v - 1 for v in clocs]
        return result
    else:
        # Handle hierarchical index
        dummy_index = index.unstack(level=clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

        unstacked = data.unstack(level=clocs, fill_value=fill_value)

        return unstacked
```

This corrected code should ensure that the handling of multi-level indices and columns is consistent and handled correctly, satisfying the expected input/output variable information provided in the expected cases.
