The bug in the function `_unstack_multiple` is caused by the incorrect handling of the `clocs` parameter, which should represent the levels to unstack. The code is attempting to use `index._get_level_number(i)` to get the level number, but it is failing due to the use of a tuple name instead of an integer level.

The failing test and error message indicate that the function is not handling tuple names correctly, leading to a `ValueError` and a subsequent `KeyError`.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the code to handle tuple names correctly. One approach to fix the bug is to modify the `_get_level_number` method of the `MultiIndex` class to handle tuple names by checking if the input is a tuple and then using it to retrieve the level number.

Here's the corrected code for the `_unstack_multiple` function:

```python
def _unstack_multiple(data, clocs, fill_value=None):
    if len(clocs) == 0:
        return data

    index = data.index

    clocs = [index._get_level_number(i) if isinstance(i, tuple) else i for i in clocs]

    # rest of the code remains unchanged
```

With this modification, the function should be able to handle tuple names correctly and pass the failing test. The corrected function should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided and successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub report.
