## Response 1
Justification: The error message specifically mentions "return super(PeriodEngine, self).vgetter().view("i8")" which points to the internal implementation of the _engine function. This indicates that there might be an issue with the _engine function itself or its interaction with the PeriodEngine class.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 2
Justification: The error message indicates an AttributeError related to 'self._engine', which is the function being called in the buggy function's source code. It suggests that the '_engine' attribute is set to None and does not have the 'view' attribute, causing the AttributeError.
Conclusion: Yes. This error message is useful and relevant to fixing the bug in the buggy function.

## Response 3
Justification: The error message indicates that there is an AttributeError related to a 'NoneType' object in the _engine function. This indicates that the bug may be related to the _engine function, and the test code is specifically testing the behavior of the _engine function in relation to monotonic check.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 4
Justification: The error message indicates an AttributeError related to the _engine attribute, which is directly related to the buggy function _engine(self) that is being called in the test code.
Conclusion: Yes. The test code and error message would be useful and relevant to fixing the buggy function.

## Response 5
Justification: The error message indicates an AttributeError related to the PeriodEngine, which is being used in the _engine function. This suggests that there may be an issue with the _engine function or the PeriodEngine itself, which could be relevant to fixing the bug.
Conclusion: Yes.
