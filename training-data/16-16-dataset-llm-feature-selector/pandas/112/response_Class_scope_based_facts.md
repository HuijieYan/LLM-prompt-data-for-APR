## Response 1
Justification: The provided method signatures are relevant as they are part of the same class containing the buggy function, and they are called within the buggy function.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 2
Justification: The method signatures provided are directly related to the buggy function and are used within the buggy function's source code. Therefore, they would be useful and relevant to fixing the buggy function.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 3
Justification: The method signatures of the relative functions (e.g., `left`, `right`, `closed`, etc.) and the `get_loc` and `equals` functions provide relevant information about the functionality and potential interactions with the `get_indexer` function. Understanding how these relative functions are implemented and their expected behavior can provide insights into how the `get_indexer` function should be behaving and interacting with these other functions.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 4
Justification: The method signatures provided are relevant as they are related to the functions called within the buggy function's source code.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 5
Justification: The method signatures provided are relevant to the buggy function because they are part of the class containing the buggy function and are used within the buggy function.
Conclusion: Yes.
