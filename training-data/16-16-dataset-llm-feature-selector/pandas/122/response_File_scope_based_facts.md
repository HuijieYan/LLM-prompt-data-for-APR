## Response 1
Justification: The function signatures provided include the `_consolidate_inplace` and `equals` functions, which are directly called within the buggy function. These functions could potentially be related to the bug in the buggy function.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 2
Justification: The file contains the function signatures for 'equals', '_consolidate_inplace', and 'canonicalize', which are all used in the buggy function's source code. This means that the relevant functions are available in the same file.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 3
Justification: The function _consolidate_inplace is called within the buggy function, so having its signature in the same file is relevant for fixing the bug. Also, the function equals is called within the buggy function, so having its signature in the same file is also relevant for fixing the bug.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 4
Justification: The provided function signatures are related to the methods used in the buggy function, such as _consolidate_inplace and equals.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 5
Justification: The function signatures provided are all related to the buggy function's source code. The functions are used in the buggy function's source code and are defined in the same file.
Conclusion: Yes.
