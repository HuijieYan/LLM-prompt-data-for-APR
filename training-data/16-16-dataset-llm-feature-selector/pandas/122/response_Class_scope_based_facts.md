## Response 1
Justification: The source code references the method "self._consolidate_inplace()", which is a method signature defined in the class containing the buggy function.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 2
Justification: The provided function signatures for `as_array` and `_consolidate_inplace` could be useful in fixing the buggy function, as they are called within the buggy function.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 3
Justification: The method signatures of `as_array`, `_consolidate_inplace`, and `canonicalize` are relevant to the buggy function because they are called within the `equals` function. These methods may have an impact on the comparison of `self.blocks` and `other.blocks`.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 4
Justification: The method signatures provided are relevant and helpful in fixing the bug as they are directly related to the methods called within the buggy function.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 5
Justification: The method signatures for as_array, _consolidate_inplace, and canonicalize are used within the buggy function, so understanding their functionality and potential bugs could be useful in fixing the buggy function.
Conclusion: Yes.
