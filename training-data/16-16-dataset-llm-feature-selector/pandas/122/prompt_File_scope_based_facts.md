# Prompt File scope based facts

Your task is to determine whether the provided fact would be useful and relevant to fixing the buggy function.

Assume you know the buggy function source code, 
Does following used function signatures with the same file help to fix the bug?

The buggy function's source code is:
```python
def equals(self, other):
    self_axes, other_axes = self.axes, other.axes
    if len(self_axes) != len(other_axes):
        return False
    if not all(ax1.equals(ax2) for ax1, ax2 in zip(self_axes, other_axes)):
        return False
    self._consolidate_inplace()
    other._consolidate_inplace()
    if len(self.blocks) != len(other.blocks):
        return False

    # canonicalize block order, using a tuple combining the type
    # name and then mgr_locs because there might be unconsolidated
    # blocks (say, Categorical) which can only be distinguished by
    # the iteration order
    def canonicalize(block):
        return (block.dtype.name, block.mgr_locs.as_array.tolist())

    self_blocks = sorted(self.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    other_blocks = sorted(other.blocks, key=canonicalize)
    return all(
        block.equals(oblock) for block, oblock in zip(self_blocks, other_blocks)
    )

```

The used function signatures and file name are:
```
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/pandas_122/pandas/core/internals/managers.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def as_array(self, transpose=False, items=None):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def _consolidate_inplace(self):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def equals(self, other):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def dtype(self):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def _consolidate_inplace(self):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def canonicalize(block):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass


```

Your response should follow this format:
Justification: <your justification>
Conclusion: either "Yes." or "No."
