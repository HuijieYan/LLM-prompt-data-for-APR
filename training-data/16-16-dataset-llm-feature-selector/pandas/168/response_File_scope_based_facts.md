## Response 1
Justification: The function signatures provided are all defined within the same file as the buggy function. They are directly related to the functionality of the buggy function and might therefore be useful in fixing the bug.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 2
Justification: The used function signatures are from the same file and they are related to the manipulation of the input parameters and checking conditions related to the groupers, axis, and object.
Conclusion: Yes. These function signatures could be useful and relevant to fixing the buggy function as they are closely related to the input parameter manipulation and validation, which are key aspects of the buggy function.

## Response 3
Justification: The provided function signatures are all related to the implementation of the `_get_grouper` function in the same file. They are used for different checks and operations within the `_get_grouper` function.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 4
Justification: The provided function signatures are from the same file where the buggy function is located, so they are likely to be relevant and useful for fixing the bug.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 5
Justification: The provided function signatures are related to the functions used in the buggy function's source code. They include functions for getting the grouper, checking if a value is label-like, checking if a key is in the axis, and checking if a value is in the object.
Conclusion: Yes.
