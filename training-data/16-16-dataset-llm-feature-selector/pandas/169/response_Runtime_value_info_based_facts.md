# Responses
## Response 1
Justification: The values provided for input parameters q, numeric_only, axis, interpolation and runtime variables data, is_transposed, and cols are relevant to the function as they directly affect the computation of the quantile and DataFrame creation. The values for input parameters self._check_percentile, self._get_numeric_data, and self._get_axis_number are not relevant as they are methods and don't directly impact the computation of the quantile.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 2
Justification: The input parameter runtime values and the variable runtime values before the buggy function return provide information about the data being used in the function, the interpolation method, and whether specific column or row-wise calculations are being performed. This information can help identify any issues related to data type mismatches or invalid data shapes that could be causing the function to fail.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 3
Justification: The runtime variable values provide information about the input parameter types and values, as well as the data types of variables used within the function. This information can be used to diagnose and fix the bug in the function.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 4
Justification: The provided runtime variables values are related to the input parameters and the internal variables used within the buggy function. They include the values of the input parameters, as well as internal data structures and methods used within the function. These values are directly related to the logic and calculations performed within the function and can help in identifying the root cause of the bug.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 5
Justification: The runtime variable values for the input parameters of the buggy function, as well as the variables used within the function, give insights into the data being processed and the operations being performed. It helps understand the context in which the bug is occurring and may provide clues to the root cause of the issue.

Conclusion: Yes.
