## Response 1
Justification: The provided function signatures are from the same file where the buggy function is defined. This indicates that the used function signatures are relevant to the buggy function and may help in fixing the bug.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 2
Justification: The provided function signatures are from the same file and contain the `quantile` function which matches the name of the buggy function. This indicates that the provided function signatures are relevant and may help in fixing the bug.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 3
Justification: The provided function signatures are from the same file, and one of them is the exact same function as the buggy one. This indicates that the provided function signatures would be relevant and useful for fixing the buggy function.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 4
Justification: The provided function signatures are from the same file as the buggy function, so they are likely to be relevant to fixing the bug.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 5
Justification: The provided function signatures are from the same file as the buggy function, and the quantile function is the one being used in the buggy function's source code. This implies that the functions in question are related and likely to be relevant to fixing the bug.
Conclusion: Yes.
