# Responses
## Response 1
Justification: The issue details highlight that the quantile method with datetime data is not functioning as expected for DataFrames and raises a ValueError.
Conclusion: Yes. This issue message helps to fix the bug by identifying the problem with the quantile method when dealing with datetime data in DataFrames.

## Response 2
Justification: The GitHub issue message describes an issue with the DataFrame quantile method when used with datetime data, producing a ValueError when trying to concatenate arrays. This aligns with the description of the bug in the provided source code, which suggests that the quantile method does not work correctly with datetime data. 
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 3
Justification: The GitHub issue message reveals that the DataFrame quantile function is broken when working with datetime data, which is relevant as the function includes a check for `numeric_only`, and the issue specifically mentions datetime data not being computed. The issue also provides an example of the expected output, which can help in diagnosing and fixing the bug.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 4
Justification: The issue message specifically mentions that the DataFrame should return just as Series does, implying that there is a discrepancy in behavior between the two. This information directly relates to the behavior of the "quantile" function, as it is expected to work consistently across both Series and DataFrame.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 5
Justification: The GitHub issue message is relevant because it addresses a specific bug with the quantile function when used with datetime data in a DataFrame, which aligns with the bug in the buggy function source code.
Conclusion: Yes.
