## Response 1
Justification: The method signatures provided are relevant and necessary to understand the input parameters and behavior of the buggy function quantile.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 2
Justification: The method signatures provided match the method signature in the buggy function. It includes the same parameters with their default values and the same return type.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 3
Justification: The method signature provided for the quantile function matches the method signature in the buggy function's source code, indicating that it is used correctly and could potentially be relevant to fixing the bug.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 4
