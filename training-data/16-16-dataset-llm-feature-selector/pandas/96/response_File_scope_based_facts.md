## Response 1
Justification: The provided function signatures in the same file are related to date and time manipulations, which are directly relevant to the buggy function's operations on datetime objects.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 2
Justification: The provided function signatures are all related to date and time operations, including checking if a date is on an offset, getting the next business day, determining opening and closing times, and adjusting dates based on business hours. These functions could potentially be relevant to fixing the buggy function as they are closely related to date and time manipulation.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 3

These functions can be useful for fixing the bug in the given code, as they are related to the manipulation of datetime objects.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 5
Justification: The provided function signatures appear to be relevant to the bug because they seem to be related to date and time calculations, as well as detecting edge conditions and offsets.
Conclusion: Yes.
