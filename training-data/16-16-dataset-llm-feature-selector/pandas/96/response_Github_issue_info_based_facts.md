Justification: The github issue message is not directly related to the buggy function's source code. It seems to be more of an issue with the `pd.date_range` function and its behavior when using holidays with custom business hours. This does not directly provide information or context that would help fix the bug in the provided function.
Conclusion: No.

## Response 2

Conclusion: No.

## Response 3

## Response 4
