## Response 1
Justification: The method signature _adjust_bin_edges(self, binner, ax_values) is being used in the buggy function. It indicates that this method is being called within the buggy function and therefore may be relevant to fixing the bug.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 2
Justification: The method signature _adjust_bin_edges(self, binner, ax_values) seems to be relevant as it is called within the buggy function and is used to adjust the bin edges.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 3
Justification: The method signature _adjust_bin_edges(self, binner, ax_values) is used in the buggy function and is an internal method of the TimeGrouper class. It is likely relevant to the bug fix as it is used to adjust the bin edges, which could potentially impact the correctness of the function's output.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 4
Justification: The method signature _adjust_bin_edges(self, binner, ax_values) is used in the buggy function to adjust the bin edges, which is a crucial step in the function's logic. It is directly relevant to the bug fix as it involves handling bin edges and is called within the buggy function. 
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 5
Justification: The method signature `_adjust_bin_edges(self, binner, ax_values)` is directly called in the buggy function and is used to adjust the bin edges, which is relevant to the bug in the function. 
Conclusion: Yes.
