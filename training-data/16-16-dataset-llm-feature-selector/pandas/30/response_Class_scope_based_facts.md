## Response 1
Method signature: to_datetime(data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)

Justification: The method to_datetime is being used in the buggy function to try to parse data into a date column. Understanding the behavior and usage of this method could help in identifying the issue and fixing the bug.

Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 2
1. self.min_stamp
2. np.number
3. iNaT
4. self.date_unit
5. to_datetime()

Justification: 
1. self.min_stamp: This is a variable used in the comparison `new_data > self.min_stamp`. Understanding its value and usage could be relevant to fixing the bug.
2. np.number: This is used to check if the data type is a number. Understanding this method signature might be useful for debugging.
3. iNaT: This variable is used in the comparison `new_data._values == iNaT`. Knowing its value and usage could be relevant to fixing the bug.
4. self.date_unit: This variable is used as part of the date conversion process. Understanding its value and usage could be relevant to fixing the bug.
5. to_datetime(): This method is used for date conversion. Understanding its usage and potential error scenarios might be relevant to fixing the bug.

Conclusion: Yes. All of these method signatures could potentially be useful and relevant to fixing the bug in the provided function.

## Response 3
Method signature  to_datetime(new_data, errors="raise", unit=date_unit)
Justification: This method signature is relevant to the buggy function as it is being used to convert the data into datetime format within the try_convert_to_date function.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 4
Justification: The method signatures are not relevant to fixing the bug in the provided buggy function, as the issue seems to be related to data manipulation and date parsing within the function.
Conclusion: No.

## Response 5
Justification: The provided method signature does not show the full context of the buggy function and the class it belongs to. Without knowing the full context, it is difficult to determine if the method signatures would be useful and relevant to fixing the buggy function.
Conclusion: No.
