## Response 1
Justification: The provided function signatures in the same file are for functions that are directly called within the buggy function `_get_with`. These functions are `_slice`, `_get_values_tuple`, and `reindex`.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 2
Justification: The provided function signatures are relevant to the buggy function as they include functions like _slice, _get_values_tuple, and reindex, which are directly referenced in the buggy function's source code.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 3
Justification: The provided function signatures are directly related to the functions being called within the buggy function's source code. The _slice, _get_values_tuple, and reindex functions are being called within the _get_with function, indicating that the provided function signatures are likely relevant to fixing the bug.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 4
Justification: The provided function signatures are related to slicing, getting values from a tuple, and reindexing, which are all operations performed in the buggy function. These functions may provide insights into how to fix the bug in the buggy function.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 5
Justification: The provided function signatures are related to slicing, getting values from a tuple, and reindexing, all of which are operations that are directly mentioned or implied in the buggy function's source code.
Conclusion: Yes.
