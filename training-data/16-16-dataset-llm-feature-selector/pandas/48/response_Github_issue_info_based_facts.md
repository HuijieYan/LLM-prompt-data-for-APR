## Response 1
Justification: The github issue message describes a specific bug related to calling the mean function on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype resulting in a TypeError. This bug is related to the functionality of the _cython_agg_blocks function in the provided source code.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 2
Justification: The issue describes a problem with calling the mean function on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype resulting in a TypeError. The provided detailed description, along with the expected output and package versions, gives insight into the specific problem related to the usage of nullable integer data type and calling mean function after grouping.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 3
Justification: The GitHub issue message provides helpful information about the bug related to calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype, which could help in identifying and fixing the bug in the provided buggy function.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 4
Justification: The github issue message describes a problem with calling mean on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype resulting in a TypeError, which seems to be related to the function `_cython_agg_blocks` as it involves aggregation operations on the data. The issue description provides details about expected output, actual output, and the versions of pandas and numpy being used, which could potentially be useful in identifying the problem in the buggy function.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 5
Justification: The github issue message provides a specific error scenario related to calling `mean` on a DataFrameGroupBy with Int64 dtype, which is relevant to the `agg_blocks` and `agg_items` being calculated in the buggy function. It also provides related code and expected output, which can help in identifying the issue in the function.
Conclusion: Yes.
