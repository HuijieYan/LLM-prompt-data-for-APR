## Response 1
Justification: The method signatures of the relative functions in the class do not directly match the signature of the buggy function _cython_agg_blocks. The relative functions aggregate and _get_data_to_aggregate do not have the same parameters or return type as _cython_agg_blocks.
Conclusion: No.

## Response 2
Justification: The provided method signatures are relevant as they are part of the class containing the buggy function and are likely to be used in the implementation of the buggy function.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 3
Justification: The method signatures provided are related to the buggy function in the sense that they are part of the same class and may potentially be used within the buggy function.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 4
Justification: The method signatures provided give an indication of the inputs and outputs of the functions in the class. This can be helpful in understanding the context and relationships of the buggy function with other functions in the class.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 5
Justification: The method signatures provided do not directly relate to the functionality of the buggy function. The provided signatures are for other functions within the same class, but they do not provide a direct solution or insight into fixing the bug in the _cython_agg_blocks function.
Conclusion: No.
