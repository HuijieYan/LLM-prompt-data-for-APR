# Responses
## Response 1
Justification: The corresponding test code and error message highlight the issue with the model's outputs not being computed correctly during a cloning operation. It also provides insights into the layers and tensors involved in the process, potentially helping to identify where the bug may be occurring.
Conclusion: Yes. The corresponding test code and error message are useful and relevant to fixing the buggy function.

## Response 2
Justification: The provided test code and error message show that the function is failing because it cannot compute the output tensor, indicating a problem with the cloning process. This information can be useful in identifying where in the code the issue might be occurring.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 3
Justification: The error message provided clearly indicates that the function is failing to compute the output tensor, "swap_layer_1/Identity:0" in this case. This could be a key piece of information to diagnose the bug in the function.

Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 4
Justification: The error message indicates that the model was not able to compute the output for a specific tensor during the cloning process, which suggests that there may be an issue with how the function is handling the input model.
Conclusion: Yes. The test code and error message would help in fixing the bug in the function.

## Response 5
Justification: The provided test code and error message demonstrate an attempt to clone a functional model with multiple outputs using the `clone_model` function. The error message provides information about the specific assertion failure related to computing the output tensors of the model.
Conclusion: Yes. This test code and error message are useful and relevant to fixing the bug in the `clone_model` function.
