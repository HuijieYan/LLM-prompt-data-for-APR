# Responses
## Response 1
Justification: The provided test code and error message are useful because they indicate that the error is occurring when trying to clone a model with multiple outputs, which could be a specific edge case causing the bug in the _clone_functional_model function. 
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 2
Justification: The provided test code and error message show that the test function is attempting to clone a functional model with multiple outputs. The error message indicates that there is an issue with computing the output of the cloned model, specifically related to the "swap_layer_1" tensor. This gives insight into the potential bug in the `_clone_functional_model` function related to handling models with multiple outputs.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 3
Justification: The test code and error message demonstrate that the clone_model function is producing an error related to computing the output tensors. This indicates that the test code and error message are very relevant to fixing the bug, as they provide clear evidence of the specific issue with the clone_model function.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 4
Justification: The test code and error message indicate that the function `keras.models.clone_model` is being called with a functional `Model` instance. The error message specifically shows that the model outputs could not be computed, indicating a problem with the computation of the outputs during the cloning process.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 5
Justification: The error message is directly related to the creation of new layers and input tensors in the _clone_functional_model function. It provides information about which output tensor could not be computed, which can help in identifying the specific issue in the function.
Conclusion: Yes.
