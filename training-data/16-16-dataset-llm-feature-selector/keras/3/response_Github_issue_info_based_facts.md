## Response 1
Justification: The issue message provides a detailed description of an error encountered when using clone_model with multi_gpu_model and cpu_relocation=True. It also includes a code snippet that reproduces the error and mentions the specific environment in which the error occurs. Additionally, it discusses the potential cause of the error related to the use of a functional model with a layer lacking mask support.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 2
Justification: The issue mentioned in the github message is related to using clone_model() with multi_gpu_model and cpu_relocation, which leads to an error in the script provided. The error is related to the behavior of the clone_model function in Keras and how it handles layers with multiple outputs and mask support.
