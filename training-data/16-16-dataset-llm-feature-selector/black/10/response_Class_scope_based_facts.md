## Response 1
Justification: The method signature _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column) is relevant to the buggy function because it matches the parameter order and types in the source code.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 2
Justification: The provided method signatures do not match the signature of the buggy function. 
Conclusion: No.

## Response 3
Justification: The method signature of the buggy function is provided, but it does not include the entire class declaration that contains the function, making it difficult to determine the context of the function and its interactions with other parts of the class.
Conclusion: No.

## Response 4
Method Signature 1: _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix: str, column: int)
Method Signature 2: None

Justification: The provided method signatures specify the input parameters for the _partially_consume_prefix method, including the data type for each parameter. However, they do not address the issue of the buggy behavior in the function, which is related to the logic inside the function.
Conclusion: No.

## Response 5
Method signature 1: 

_partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix: str, column: int) -> Tuple[str, str]

Justification: This method signature only specifies the input types and return types, which are already explicitly used in the function definition. It does not provide any additional information that would be useful in fixing the bug.

Conclusion: No.
