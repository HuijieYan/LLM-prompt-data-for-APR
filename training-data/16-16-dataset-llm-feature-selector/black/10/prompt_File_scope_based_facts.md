# Prompt File scope based facts

Your task is to determine whether the provided fact would be useful and relevant to fixing the buggy function.

Assume you know the buggy function source code, 
Does following used function signatures with the same file help to fix the bug?

The buggy function's source code is:
```python
def _partially_consume_prefix(self, prefix, column):
    lines = []
    current_line = ""
    current_column = 0
    wait_for_nl = False
    for char in prefix:
        current_line += char
        if wait_for_nl:
            if char == '\n':
                if current_line.strip() and current_column < column:
                    res = ''.join(lines)
                    return res, prefix[len(res):]

                lines.append(current_line)
                current_line = ""
                current_column = 0
                wait_for_nl = False
        elif char == ' ':
            current_column += 1
        elif char == '\t':
            current_column += 4
        elif char == '\n':
            # unexpected empty line
            current_column = 0
        else:
            # indent is finished
            wait_for_nl = True
    return ''.join(lines), current_line

```

The used function signatures and file name are:
```
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/black_10/blib2to3/pgen2/driver.py


```

Your response should follow this format:
Justification: <your justification>
Conclusion: either "Yes." or "No."
