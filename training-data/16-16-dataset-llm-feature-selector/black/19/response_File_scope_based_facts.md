## Response 1
Justification: The provided function signatures of various functions within the same file help to understand the context and logic being used in the buggy function. They provide insight into the behavior and conditions being checked within the buggy function, which can aid in identifying any potential issues or areas for improvement.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 2
Justification: The provided function signatures are relevant as they include functions related to checking if a line is an import, decorator, class, function definition, flow control, and yield statement, all of which are directly used in the buggy function's source code.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 3
Justification: The provided function signatures all seem to be related to the functionality of the buggy function. These functions provide information on whether a line of code is an import, a decorator, a class, a function definition, a flow control statement, or a yield statement, which are all conditions used in the buggy function to determine whether to insert empty lines.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 4
Justification: The provided function signatures are related to checking whether the current line is an import, decorator, class, def, flow control, or yield. These functions are used within the buggy function to determine the type of the current line and make decisions based on that type.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 5
Justification: The provided function signatures are relevant to the buggy function because they are all related to determining different properties of a code line, such as whether it is an import, decorator, class, or def, whether it is a flow control, or whether it is a yield.
Conclusion: Yes.
