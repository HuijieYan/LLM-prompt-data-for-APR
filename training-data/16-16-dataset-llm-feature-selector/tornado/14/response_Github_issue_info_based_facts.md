## Response 1
Justification: The issue message is pointing out a specific line in the source code where IOLoop.current(instance=False) is checked for being None, and questioning why a "already exists" error is raised in that case.
Conclusion: Yes. The issue message could be helpful in fixing the bug by providing insight into the logic behind the "already exists" error.

## Response 2
Justification: The github issue message points out that at line 252, the function checks if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None, and questions why it then raises "already exists". This points to a potential issue with the logic or implementation of the function.
Conclusion: Yes. This github issue message would be helpful in fixing the bug as it points out a specific line in the code where the issue may be located and raises a question about the logic.

## Response 3
Justification: The github issue message points out a specific line in the source code where IOLoop.current(instance=False) is evaluated to None, and questions why the "already exists" error is being raised in that case. This provides a clear indication of a potential problem in the code.
Conclusion: Yes. The github issue message would be useful and relevant to fixing the buggy function.

## Response 4
Justification: The github issue message is pointing out that at line 252 of ioloop.py, the IOLoop.current instance is being checked for None or not None, and questioning why the "already exists" error is raised in this case. This is directly related to the behavior in the buggy function where it checks for IOLoop.current instance being None before raising the error.
Conclusion: Yes. This github issue message would be useful and relevant to fixing the bug.

## Response 5
Justification: The github issue mentions the specific line of code where IOLoop.current(instance=False) is being checked for None. This could provide insight into why the bug is occurring and how to fix it.
