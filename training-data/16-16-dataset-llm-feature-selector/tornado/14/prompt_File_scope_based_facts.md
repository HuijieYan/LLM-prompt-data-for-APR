# Prompt File scope based facts

Your task is to determine whether the provided fact would be useful and relevant to fixing the buggy function.

Assume you know the buggy function source code, 
Does following used function signatures with the same file help to fix the bug?

The buggy function's source code is:
```python
def initialize(self, make_current=None):
    if make_current is None:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            self.make_current()
    elif make_current:
        if IOLoop.current(instance=False) is None:
            raise RuntimeError("current IOLoop already exists")
        self.make_current()

```

The used function signatures and file name are:
```
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/tornado_14/tornado/ioloop.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def current(instance=True):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def make_current(self):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass


```

Your response should follow this format:
Justification: <your justification>
Conclusion: either "Yes." or "No."
