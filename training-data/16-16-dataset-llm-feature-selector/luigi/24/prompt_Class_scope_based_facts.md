# Prompt Class scope based facts

Your task is to determine whether the provided fact would be useful and relevant to fixing the buggy function.

Assume you know the buggy function source code, does following used method signatures help to fix the bug?

The buggy function's source code is:
```python
def _dict_arg(self, name, value):
    command = []
    if value and isinstance(value, dict):
        for prop, value in value.items():
            command += [name, '"{0}={1}"'.format(prop, value)]
    return command

```

The class declaration containing the buggy function and used method signatures is:
```
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class SparkSubmitTask(luigi.Task):
    """
    Template task for running a Spark job
    
    Supports running jobs on Spark local, standalone, Mesos or Yarn
    
    See http://spark.apache.org/docs/latest/submitting-applications.html
    for more information
    """

    # ... omitted code ...



```

Your response should follow this format:
Justification: <your justification>
Conclusion: either "Yes." or "No."
