## Response 1
Justification: The error message clearly indicates that there is a TypeError due to adding a 'NoneType' and an 'int' in the prune method.
Conclusion: Yes. The error message is useful and relevant to fixing the bug in the prune method.

## Response 2
Justification: The error message clearly states the specific line in the code where the error occurred, which is when trying to add a 'NoneType' and an 'int' together in the prune function.
Conclusion: Yes. This information is useful and relevant for fixing the bug in the prune function.

## Response 3
Justification: The error message clearly points out that the issue is with the '+' operation involving 'NoneType' and 'int', which is related to the 'last_active' attribute being set to `None` as a default value.
Conclusion: Yes. This fact would be useful and relevant to fixing the bug in the buggy function.

## Response 4
Justification: The error message clearly indicates that the issue is with the "last_active" attribute being of type None and not able to be added to an integer value.
Conclusion: Yes. This error message is very relevant to fixing the bug in the buggy function.

## Response 5
Justification: The error message clearly shows that the bug is related to the self.last_active variable being of type NoneType, and the operation of adding it to an integer is causing a TypeError. This makes it clear that the value of last_active is not being properly initialized or set in the __init__ function.
Conclusion: Yes. This information would be useful and relevant to fixing the bug.
