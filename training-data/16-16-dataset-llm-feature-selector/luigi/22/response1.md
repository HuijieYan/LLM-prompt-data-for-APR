# Responses
## Response 1
Justification: The method signatures provided do not help in fixing the bug as they do not relate to the initialization of the Worker class or the attributes being set in the __init__ method.
Conclusion: No.

## Response 2
Method signatures:
1. def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None): 
2. def check_last_active(self, current_time): 
3. def add_task(self, task): 

Justification: 
The provided method signatures do not directly match the buggy function's __init__ method. However, they may be useful in fixing the bug by addressing the last_active attribute or adding tasks to the worker's task set.

Conclusion:
Yes. The method signatures could potentially be useful in fixing the bug.

## Response 3
Method 1:
```python
def update_last_active(self, new_last_active):
    self.last_active = new_last_active
```
Justification: This method updates the last active time of the worker.
Conclusion: Yes.

Method 2:
```python
def add_task(self, task):
    self.tasks.add(task)
```
Justification: This method adds a task to the set of tasks for the worker.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 4
Justification: The provided method signatures do not seem relevant to fixing the bug in the given buggy function. The bug appears to be related to the incorrect initialization of the 'last_active' attribute.
Conclusion: No.

## Response 5
Justification: The method signatures provided do not relate to the buggy function in any way. They are not relevant to fixing the bug in the __init__ function.
Conclusion: No.
