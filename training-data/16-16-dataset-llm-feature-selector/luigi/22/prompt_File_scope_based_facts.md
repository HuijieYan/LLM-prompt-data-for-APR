# Prompt File scope based facts

Your task is to determine whether the provided fact would be useful and relevant to fixing the buggy function.

Assume you know the buggy function source code, 
Does following used function signatures with the same file help to fix the bug?

The buggy function's source code is:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}

```

The used function signatures and file name are:
```
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_22/luigi/scheduler.py


```

Your response should follow this format:
Justification: <your justification>
Conclusion: either "Yes." or "No."
