# Prompt Test info based facts

Your task is to determine whether the provided fact would be useful and relevant to fixing the buggy function.
Assume you know the buggy function source code, 
does following corresponding test code and error message for the buggy function helps to fix the bug?

The buggy function's source code is:
```python
def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):
    self.id = worker_id
    self.reference = None  # reference to the worker in the real world. (Currently a dict containing just the host)
    self.last_active = last_active  # seconds since epoch
    self.started = time.time()  # seconds since epoch
    self.tasks = set()  # task objects
    self.info = {}

```

The corresponding test code and error message are:
# A test function for the buggy function
```python
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_22/test/scheduler_test.py

    def test_worker_prune_after_init(self):
        worker = luigi.scheduler.Worker(123)

        class TmpCfg:
            def __init__(self):
                self.worker_disconnect_delay = 10

        worker.prune(TmpCfg())
```

## Error message from test function
