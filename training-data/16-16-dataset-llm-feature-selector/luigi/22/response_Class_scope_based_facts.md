# Responses
## Response 1
Justification: The provided method signatures do not match the provided buggy function source code. The given source code is for a constructor method, while the provided method signatures do not include the constructor method.
Conclusion: No.

## Response 2
Justification: The provided method signatures do not contain any information about the specific bug in the buggy function. The method signatures only show the initialization of the Worker class and do not provide any clues about the bug or how to fix it.
Conclusion: No.

## Response 3
Justification: The provided method signatures do not directly relate to the buggy function as they are not methods of the class Worker. The bug seems to be related to the initialization of the Worker class and the handling of last_active attribute.
Conclusion: No.

## Response 4
Justification: The provided method signatures do not match the __init__ constructor signature in the buggy function's source code.
Conclusion: No.

## Response 5
1. Method signature: `def __init__(self, worker_id, last_active=None):`

Justification: This method signature is relevant to the buggy function. It is the constructor method of the class and is directly related to the initialization of the attributes of the Worker class, including the `last_active` attribute which is part of the buggy function.
Conclusion: Yes.

2. Method signature: `def update_last_active(self, last_active):`

Justification: This method signature is relevant to the buggy function. It indicates that there is a separate method for updating the `last_active` attribute. This could be useful for fixing the bug related to updating the `last_active` attribute.
Conclusion: Yes.
