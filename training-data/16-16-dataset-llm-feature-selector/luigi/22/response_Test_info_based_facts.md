## Response 1
Justification: The error message clearly indicates that the issue is related to the `last_active` attribute in the buggy function. It is attempting to add `config.worker_disconnect_delay` to `self.last_active` which is resulting in a `TypeError` because `self.last_active` is of `NoneType`.
Conclusion: Yes. This error message is useful and relevant to fixing the bug because it clearly points out the issue with the `last_active` attribute in the buggy function.

## Response 2
Justification: The error message clearly identifies that the issue is related to adding "NoneType" and "int" together in the prune function. 
Conclusion: Yes. This error message is relevant and useful for fixing the bug in the function.

## Response 3
Justification: The error message clearly indicates that the issue is related to the `last_active` attribute being of type `NoneType`, and the code is trying to add an integer to it. This aligns with the provided source code of the buggy function, as the `last_active` attribute is set to `None` when it is not provided. 
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 4
Justification: The error message indicates that there is an issue with adding the value of self.last_active (which is None by default) to an integer value. This aligns with the fact that the last_active parameter is set to None when the init function is called without providing a value. 
Conclusion: Yes. This error message would be useful and relevant to fixing the bug.

## Response 5
Justification: The error message clearly points out that there is a TypeError because of the addition of 'NoneType' and 'int' in the `prune` method of the `Worker` class. This directly relates to the initialization of the `last_active` attribute in the buggy function's source code.
Conclusion: Yes.
