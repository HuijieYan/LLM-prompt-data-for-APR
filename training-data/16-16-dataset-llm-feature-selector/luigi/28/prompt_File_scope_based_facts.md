# Prompt File scope based facts

Your task is to determine whether the provided fact would be useful and relevant to fixing the buggy function.

Assume you know the buggy function source code, 
Does following used function signatures with the same file help to fix the bug?

The buggy function's source code is:
```python
def table_exists(self, table, database='default', partition=None):
    if partition is None:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd('use {0}; show tables like "{1}";'.format(database, table))

        return stdout and table in stdout
    else:
        stdout = run_hive_cmd("""use %s; show partitions %s partition
                            (%s)""" % (database, table, self.partition_spec(partition)))

        if stdout:
            return True
        else:
            return False

```

The used function signatures and file name are:
```
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_28/luigi/contrib/hive.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def run_hive_cmd(hivecmd, check_return_code=True):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def partition_spec(self, partition):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def partition_spec(self, partition):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def partition_spec(self, partition):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass


```

Your response should follow this format:
Justification: <your justification>
Conclusion: either "Yes." or "No."
