Justification: The provided function signatures from the same file might be relevant to fixing the buggy function because they are defined in the same file and could potentially be used within the buggy function.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 2
Justification: The provided function signatures are from the same file as the buggy function, so they are likely to be relevant to fixing the bug.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 3
Justification: The provided function signatures are from the same file where the buggy function is located. This means that they are likely to be relevant to fixing the bug.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 4
Justification: Since the buggy function calls the _credentials and copy_options functions from the same file, it is relevant to determine if there is a bug related to these function calls.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 5
Justification: The _credentials and copy_options functions are defined in the same file as the buggy function, and are being used in the buggy function to retrieve credentials and copy options. This suggests that these functions are relevant to the behavior of the buggy function.
Conclusion: Yes.
