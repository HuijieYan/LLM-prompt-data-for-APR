# Prompt File scope based facts

Your task is to determine whether the provided fact would be useful and relevant to fixing the buggy function.

Assume you know the buggy function source code, 
Does following used function signatures with the same file help to fix the bug?

The buggy function's source code is:
```python
def copy(self, cursor, f):
    """
    Defines copying from s3 into redshift.

    If both key-based and role-based credentials are provided, role-based will be used.
    """
    logger.info("Inserting file: %s", f)
    colnames = ''
    if len(self.columns) > 0:
        colnames = ",".join([x[0] for x in self.columns])
        colnames = '({})'.format(colnames)

    cursor.execute("""
     COPY {table} {colnames} from '{source}'
     CREDENTIALS '{creds}'
     {options}
     ;""".format(
        table=self.table,
        colnames=colnames,
        source=f,
        creds=self._credentials(),
        options=self.copy_options)
    )

```

The used function signatures and file name are:
```
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/luigi_4/luigi/contrib/redshift.py

# relative function's signature in this file
def _credentials(self):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass

# relative function's signature in this file
def copy_options(self):
    # ... omitted code ...
    pass


```

Your response should follow this format:
Justification: <your justification>
Conclusion: either "Yes." or "No."
