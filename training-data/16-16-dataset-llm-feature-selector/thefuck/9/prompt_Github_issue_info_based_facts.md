# Prompt Github issue info based facts

Your task is to determine whether the provided fact would be useful and relevant to fixing the buggy function.
Assume you know the buggy function source code,
does following github issue message helps to fix the bug?

The buggy function's source code is:
```python
@git_support
def get_new_command(command):
    # If --set-upstream or -u are passed, remove it and its argument. This is
    # because the remaining arguments are concatenated onto the command suggested
    # by git, which includes --set-upstream and its argument
    upstream_option_index = -1
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('--set-upstream')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    try:
        upstream_option_index = command.script_parts.index('-u')
    except ValueError:
        pass
    if upstream_option_index is not -1:
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)
        command.script_parts.pop(upstream_option_index)

    push_upstream = command.stderr.split('\n')[-3].strip().partition('git ')[2]
    return replace_argument(" ".join(command.script_parts), 'push', push_upstream)

```

The github issue message is:
# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
Fix suggestions for git push -u origin
```

## The associated detailed issue description
```text
Resolves #558
```

# A GitHub issue title for this bug
```text
#538 broke git push -u myfork suggestions
```

## The associated detailed issue description
```text
For example:

[josephfrazier@Josephs-MacBook-Pro ~/workspace/thefuck] (tmp) $
git push -u josephfrazier
fatal: The current branch tmp has no upstream branch.
To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream josephfrazier tmp

[josephfrazier@Josephs-MacBook-Pro ~/workspace/thefuck] (tmp) $
fuck
hub push --set-upstream josephfrazier tmp -u josephfrazier [enter/↑/↓/ctrl+c]
Instead, the suggestion should be git push --set-upstream josephfrazier tmp, like it was before #538 was merged. I'll see if I can put together a fix for this.
```



Your response should follow this format:
Justification: <your justification>
