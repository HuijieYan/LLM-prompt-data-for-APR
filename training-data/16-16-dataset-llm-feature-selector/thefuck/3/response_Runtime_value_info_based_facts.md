# Responses
## Response 1
Justification: Yes, the runtime variable values provided are useful and relevant to fixing the bug. The values for `proc` and `version` are directly related to the function's behavior and will help in identifying any discrepancies in the function's execution.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 2
Justification: The runtime variable values provided show the mocked objects and their types, along with the actual version value that the function is trying to extract from the shell. 
Conclusion: Yes. These runtime variable values would be useful and relevant to fixing the bug in the function, as they give insight into the actual and expected values of the variables involved in the function.

## Response 3
Justification: 
The runtime variable values are related to the output of the Popen process, specifically the version of the Fish shell. This value is directly used in the `info` function to form the return string, so understanding the actual value of the version and the Popen process is crucial to fixing the bug.

Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 4
Justification: The runtime variable values provide the expected values for the variables proc and version before the function returns. This information would be useful in identifying any discrepancies between the expected and actual values and in debugging the function.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 5
Justification: 
The provided runtime variable values are related to the functioning of the Popen class and its output. They show the mocked values for the Popen class and its attributes, along with the version value being set to '3.5.9'.

Conclusion: 
Yes.
