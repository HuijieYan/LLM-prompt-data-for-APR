# Prompt File scope based facts

Your task is to determine whether the provided fact would be useful and relevant to fixing the buggy function.

Assume you know the buggy function source code, 
Does following used function signatures with the same file help to fix the bug?

The buggy function's source code is:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)

```

The used function signatures and file name are:
```
# file name: /Volumes/SSD2T/bgp_envs/repos/thefuck_3/thefuck/shells/fish.py


```

Your response should follow this format:
Justification: <your justification>
Conclusion: either "Yes." or "No."
