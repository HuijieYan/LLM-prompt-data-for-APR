# Prompt Class scope based facts

Your task is to determine whether the provided fact would be useful and relevant to fixing the buggy function.

Assume you know the buggy function source code, does following used method signatures help to fix the bug?

The buggy function's source code is:
```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)

```

The class declaration containing the buggy function and used method signatures is:
```
# class declaration containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    # ... omitted code ...



```

Your response should follow this format:
Justification: <your justification>
Conclusion: either "Yes." or "No."
