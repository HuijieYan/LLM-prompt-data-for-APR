## Response 4
Justification: The github issue message provides information about the bug being related to the "git" command and the error message "IndexError: list index out of range" is also present in the detailed description. This suggests that the issue is caused by the "git" command and an IndexError.

## Response 5
Justification: The github issue message provides information about the specific error encountered (IndexError: list index out of range) when the function is executed with 'git' as the script. This error is directly related to the condition inside the buggy function, which splits the command script and accesses the second element without checking if it exists.
