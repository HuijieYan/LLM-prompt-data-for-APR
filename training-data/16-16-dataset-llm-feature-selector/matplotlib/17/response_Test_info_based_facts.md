# Responses
## Response 1
Justification: The error messages indicate that there are runtime warnings related to overflow encountered in scalar subtraction and scalar absolute operations.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 2
Justification: The error message from the test function indicates that there is a runtime warning for overflow encountered in scalar subtract and overflow encountered in scalar absolute. These warnings suggest that there might be an issue with the range modification in the nonsingular function.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 3
Justification: The error message is indicating a runtime warning for overflow encountered in scalar subtract or scalar absolute when calling the nonsingular function. It also provides the inputs vmin, vmax, expander, tiny, and increasing. This information can help identify the specific conditions where the bug occurs and aid in debugging the nonsingular function.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 4
Justification: The test code and error message provided for the buggy function both show the specific values being passed into the function as well as the runtime warnings encountered during the function's execution. This allows for pinpointing the exact input values that are causing the buggy behavior, as well as the specific warning messages that are being raised.
Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 5
Justification: The error message indicates a "RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar subtract" and "RuntimeWarning: overflow encountered in scalar absolute" when calling the `nonsingular` function. This suggests that there may be an issue with numerical values resulting in overflow errors.
Conclusion: Yes.
