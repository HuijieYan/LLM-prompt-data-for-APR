## Response 1
Justification: The provided method signatures do not actually contain any method implementations or signatures.

Conclusion: No.

## Response 2
Justification: The method signatures provided are not relevant or useful for fixing the buggy function as they do not relate to the execution of the _recache method.
Conclusion: No.

## Response 3
Method Signature 1: ```_marker_function()```

Justification: This method signature is relevant as it is being called within the _recache method. Understanding what _marker_function does and how it is implemented could provide insights into the bug.

Conclusion: Yes.

## Response 4
Method signature: _recache(self)
Justification: The method signature indicates that the method is a private method specific to the MarkerStyle class, which means it is not meant to be accessed or overridden by external classes. This may limit the relevance of the method signature to fixing the bug.
Conclusion: No.

## Response 5
Method signature: _recache(self)

Justification: The method signature _recache(self) represents the method being used in the source code, so it is relevant to fixing the bug.
Conclusion: Yes.
