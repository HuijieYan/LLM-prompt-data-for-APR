The problem with the buggy function lies in the if-elif-else statement at the beginning. The function currently only handles the case where the `image.format` is 'PNG' and the `image.mode` is 'RGBA', converting these images to 'RGB'. It should also handle the case where the `image.format` is 'JPEG' and directly return the image without conversion.

The failing test is primarily related to the incorrect conversion of the image and its colors, which results in a mismatch between the expected and actual values.

To fix the bug, the function should be updated to correctly handle different image formats and modes, as well as properly apply the specified thumbnail size.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO
from scrapy.pipelines.images import FilesPipeline

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

This corrected code checks for both 'PNG' and 'RGBA' format and mode before performing the necessary conversions. Additionally, it also takes into account the specified thumbnail size when resizing the image.

This should resolve the issues identified in the failing test cases and ensure that the function produces the expected output for the given input parameters.
