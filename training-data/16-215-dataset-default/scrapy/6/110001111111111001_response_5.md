The issue in the `convert_image` function seems to be related to the image conversion and thumbnail creation process. The code is not properly handling the cases where the image is a JPEG with size specified and where the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA'.

The failing test is related to the conversion of images and the assertion failures indicate that the image colors are not being correctly converted.

To fix the bug, we need to properly handle the image conversion and thumbnail creation based on the input parameters and image properties.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageOps
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        thumb = ImageOps.fit(image, size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    else:
        thumb = image

    buf = BytesIO()
    thumb.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return thumb, buf
```

The changes made to the `convert_image` function include:
- Fixing the thumbnail creation process by using `ImageOps.fit` to maintain the aspect ratio and fit within the specified size.
- Saving the thumbnail image to the buffer to ensure the correct output format.

With these changes, the `convert_image` function should now produce the expected output and pass the failing test cases.
