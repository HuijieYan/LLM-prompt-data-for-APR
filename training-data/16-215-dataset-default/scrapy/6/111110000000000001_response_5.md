1. The buggy function is `convert_image` which is a method of the `ImagesPipeline` class. This class is inheriting from `FilesPipeline`.

2. The potential error location is within the conditional statements that check for the image format and mode.

3. The bug's cause:
   (a) The buggy function `convert_image` does not handle all possible image formats and modes.
   (b) The `ImagesPipeline` class might not be handling the conversion of images properly for all formats and modes.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Add additional conditionals to handle other image formats and modes.
   - Ensure that the image conversion logic is comprehensive and covers all possible scenarios.

5. Corrected code:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO
from scrapy.pipelines.images import ImagesPipeline

class MyImagesPipeline(ImagesPipeline):
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        buf.seek(0)
        return image, buf
```

In the corrected code, the `convert_image` method now handles the PNG format with RGBA mode by creating a new background image and pasting the original image onto it. It also ensures that the image is converted to RGB if it is not already in that mode. Additionally, it properly handles the image thumbnail generation and saves the image in the JPEG format.
