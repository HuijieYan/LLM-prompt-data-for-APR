The problem with the provided code is that the image is not being saved in the correct format. The conversion to JPEG is not being handled properly for all cases. It seems that the function is not handling the conversion correctly for different types of input images.

To fix the issue, we need to ensure that the image is converted to the correct format (RGB or JPEG) based on its original format and mode.

One possible approach to fix this issue is to check the image format and mode at the beginning of the function and handle the conversion accordingly for different cases.

Here is the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageFile
from io import BytesIO
from scrapy.pipelines.images import FilesPipeline

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        if image.format != 'JPEG':
            try:
                image.save(buf, format='JPEG', quality=95)
            except:
                ImageFile.MAXBLOCK = image.size[0] * image.size[1]
                image.save(buf, "JPEG", quality=95)
        else:
            image.save(buf, 'JPEG', quality=95)
        
        return image, buf
```

This should fix the issue by properly handling the conversion to JPEG format for all cases. The corrected function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
