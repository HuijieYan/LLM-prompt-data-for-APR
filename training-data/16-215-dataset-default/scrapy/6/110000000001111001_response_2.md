The issue with the buggy function lies in the logic for handling image format and mode. Specifically, when the input image is in 'PNG' format and 'RGBA' mode, the function is attempting to convert it to 'RGB' format without taking into account that the image background needs to be filled with white color. Additionally, when the image mode is not 'RGB', it is attempting to convert it to 'RGB' without addressing the need to fill the background with white color for 'RGBA' images.

To fix this, we need to modify the logic to properly handle the conversion of 'PNG' images with 'RGBA' mode to 'RGB' format with a white background. We also need to ensure that when the image mode is not 'RGB', it is converted to 'RGBA' with a white background.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageOps
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image = ImageOps.pad(image, (image.width, image.height), color=(255, 255, 255))
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = ImageOps.pad(image, (image.width, image.height), color=(255, 255, 255))
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected function now appropriately handles the conversion of 'PNG' images with 'RGBA' mode to 'RGB' format with a white background, and also ensures that images with modes other than 'RGB' are converted to 'RGBA' with a white background. This fixed function should satisfy all the expected input/output variable information provided.
