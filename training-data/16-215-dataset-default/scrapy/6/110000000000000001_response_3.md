1. The buggy function is designed to convert an input image to the RGB format and resize it, if required. However, there are a couple of potential issues in the function that need to be addressed.

2. The potential error location is within the conditional statements that handle the conversion of the image to the RGB format and resizing the image.

3. The bug's cause is that the conditional statements are not handling all edge cases properly, and the function may not always return the expected output.

4. To fix the bug, we can:
   - Check if the input image is in the RGBA format and convert it to RGB after pasting on a white background.
   - Check if the input image is not in the RGB format and convert it to RGB.
   - Check if the size parameter is provided and resize the image accordingly.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)  # Reset the pointer to the start of the buffer
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected code, we have fixed the conditional statements for converting the image from RGBA to RGB and for checking the mode of the input image. Additionally, we have added buf.seek(0) to reset the pointer to the start of the buffer before returning it.
