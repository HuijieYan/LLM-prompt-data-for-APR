The bug in the `convert_image` function lies in the conditional statements that check if the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'. The code correctly converts the image to RGB if the format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', but it fails to handle the use case where the format is 'JPEG', and the mode is 'RGB', which is a valid condition.

The failing test is checking the color values of the image after conversion, and it fails when the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA' due to an issue in the conversion process.

To fix this bug, the code should handle the case where the format is 'JPEG' and the mode is 'RGB' properly. Additionally, it should correctly handle transparency in the case of PNG images.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.format == 'JPEG' and image.mode == 'RGB':
        pass  # No conversion needed for JPEG images with RGB mode
    else:
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        image.save(buf, 'PNG', transparency=0)
    else:
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')

    buf.seek(0)
    return image, buf
```

With the above correction, the `convert_image` function now correctly handles the conversion of images based on their format and mode, and it also handles transparency for PNG images. This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
