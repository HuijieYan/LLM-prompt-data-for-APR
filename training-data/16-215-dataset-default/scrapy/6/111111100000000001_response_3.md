1. The buggy function is part of the ImagesPipeline class, which is a subclass of FilesPipeline. It is responsible for converting images to the desired format and size.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement that checks the image format and mode.

3. The bug's cause is likely related to the conditional statement not working as expected. It may be failing to properly convert images to the desired format and size based on the conditions specified.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   a. Adding proper error handling to catch any exceptions that may arise during the image conversion process.
   b. Checking if the image format and mode actually meet the specified conditions before attempting to convert the image.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO
from scrapy.pipelines.files import FilesPipeline

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

In the corrected code, the conditional statement for checking image format and mode has been updated with the correct syntax for pasting the image onto a background and converting it to the desired format. Additionally, the import statements have been adjusted for better readability.
