The issue with the buggy function is that it doesn't handle the case where the image format is JPEG and the mode is already RGB. In this case, it should not be converted.

To fix the bug, we need to add a condition to check if the image format is JPEG and the mode is not RGB. If this condition is not met, the function should return the original image without any modifications.

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.format == 'JPEG' and image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
        
    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected code, the function will now properly handle the different cases and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
