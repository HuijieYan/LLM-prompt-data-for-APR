The main issue with the `convert_image` function seems to be that it does not correctly handle PNG images with an RGBA mode. When the input image is PNG and mode is RGBA, the function is supposed to convert it to RGB, but this doesn't seem to be working correctly based on the error message from the failing test and the expected values of the variables.

There might also be an issue with the background that is created for PNG images with RGBA mode, as the background appears to be incorrectly used or created.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the function correctly converts PNG images with RGBA mode to RGB, and that it creates the background correctly. It should also handle the conversion to RGB for other modes correctly.

The corrected code for the `convert_image` function is provided below:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageFile
from io import BytesIO

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, image)
            image = background
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

With these changes, the function should now handle the different image modes correctly and pass the failing test.
