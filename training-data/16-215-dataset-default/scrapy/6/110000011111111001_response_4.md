The issue with the buggy function lies in the first condition check. The condition checks for image format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA', but the correct check should be for either PNG or RGBA and not both together. The incorrect check causes the function to skip the image conversion and pasting the image on a background of white color.

Additionally, the function doesn't return the buffer when the size is not mentioned. This is causing issues with the test, as it expects both the image and the buffer to be returned regardless of the size parameter.

To fix the bug, the condition checks in the function need to be properly modified, and the return statement should return the buffer along with the image for all cases.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' or image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), mask=image.split()[3])
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected function, all the failing cases should pass and the expected output should match the actual output.
