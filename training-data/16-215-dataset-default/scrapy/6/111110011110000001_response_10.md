1. The function `convert_image` has a bug that causes images with format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA' to not be converted properly.

2. The potential error location is within the conditional block that checks if the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA'.

3. (a) The buggy function does not handle the conversion of PNG images with RGBA mode properly.
   (b) The `ImagesPipeline` class is not handling the image conversion correctly, causing the failing test.
   (c) The failing test is checking the colors of the images after conversion and it fails because the conversion is not handled correctly, resulting in a different color representation.

4. One possible approach to fixing the bug is to properly handle the conversion of PNG images with mode 'RGBA' by creating a new image with a white background and then converting it to RGB.
Another approach is to ensure that the alpha channel is properly handled during the conversion process.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO
from scrapy.pipelines.files import FilesPipeline

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            # Create a new image with white background
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
            # Composite the original image over the white background
            image = Image.alpha_composite(background, image)
            # Convert the image to RGB
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        buf.seek(0)  # Move the buffer position to the start
        return image, buf
```
In the corrected code, we handle the conversion of PNG images with RGBA mode by creating a new image with a white background and compositing the original image over it to preserve the alpha channel. Then, we convert the image to RGB before proceeding with the thumbnail creation and saving the image. This should address the failing test case and ensure that images with PNG format and RGBA mode are handled correctly.
