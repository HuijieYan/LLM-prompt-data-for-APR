The issue with the `convert_image` function is that it's not properly handling the images with different modes and formats. It's converting all images to RGB and saving them in JPEG format, which is causing the discrepancies in the test results.

To fix the bug, we should modify the function to handle different image formats and modes correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        if image.format:
            image.save(buf, image.format)
        else:
            image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

This corrected function will handle image formats and modes properly, saving the image in its original format and converting it to RGB only when necessary.

With this corrected function, the failing test should pass, and it should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
