The function provided is supposed to convert images to a specific format, handle transparency, and generate thumbnails. 

However, there are a couple of issues in the function that are causing it to fail the tests:

1. In the first condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':`, the background image is created and then pasted with the original image using the same element as the new image. This line should be `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)`.

2. After the condition block, where the mode is checked for equality with 'RGB', there is no return statement. This means that the function will continue to execute the subsequent code where the size check is performed even if the mode of the image is not 'RGB'.

The corrected function would look like this:

```python
from scrapy.pipelines.files import FilesPipeline
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

With these changes, the function should now properly handle the cases provided and pass the failing tests.
