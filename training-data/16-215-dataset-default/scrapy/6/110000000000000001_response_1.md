1. The buggy function `convert_image` takes an image and an optional size as input and performs some operations on the image, such as converting the image format and resizing it. The function then returns the processed image and a BytesIO object.

2. The potential error location within the function is in the if-else statement that checks the image format and mode.

3. The cause of the bug is that the if-else statement logic is incorrect. The condition to check whether the image format is 'PNG' and mode is 'RGBA' is not properly handling the image conversion.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the image format and mode separately and perform the necessary operations accordingly.
   - Ensure that the image mode and format are properly handled before and after any conversions or processing.

5. Corrected code:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)
    
    return image, buf
```
