The buggy function is used to convert an image to a different format and size. The failing test checks for the behavior of the function under different scenarios such as RGB and JPEG, transparency cases, and thumbnail generation.

The potential error location within the problematic function is in the conditional statements for checking the image format and mode. 

The bug's cause is that the conditional statements for checking the image format and mode are not handling all cases correctly, leading to incorrect conversions.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
- Adding a specific condition for handling the case when the image format is 'PNG' and the image mode is 'RGBA'.
- Changing the conditional statements to cover all cases of image format and mode.

Below is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

# This is the corrected function
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With the corrected function, it should pass the failing test and handle the different scenarios correctly.
