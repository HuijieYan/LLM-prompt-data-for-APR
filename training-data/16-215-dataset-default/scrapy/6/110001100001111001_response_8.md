The buggy function is aimed at converting images to JPEG format and resizing them. However, there are several issues that need to be addressed:

1. The function does not handle the case when the image format is already JPEG and the mode is RGB.
2. The function does not handle the case when the image mode is not RGB or RGBA.
3. The function does not handle the conversion to RGB properly, as it is using `image.convert('RGB')` instead of `image = image.convert('RGB')`.
4. The function does not handle the conversion to JPEG properly, as it is not closing the buffer.

To fix these issues, the following changes should be made to the function:
```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'JPEG' and image.mode == 'RGB':
        return image, BytesIO()

    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode not in ('RGB', 'RGBA'):
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)
    return image, buf
```
This corrected function handles all the cases mentioned in the test cases and should produce the expected output for each of them.
