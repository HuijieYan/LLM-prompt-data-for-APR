The issue with the function is that it is trying to convert the image to RGB or JPEG without taking into account the original format and mode of the image. This can lead to issues when the image is already in the correct format and mode.

To fix the bug, we need to first check if the image format is PNG and mode is RGBA. If so, we need to create a new background image and paste the original image onto it to remove the alpha channel. Then we convert the image to RGB. If the format is not PNG, we can directly convert the image to RGB. Finally, if a size is provided, we can create a thumbnail of the image.

The corrected code for the function is as follows:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO
from scrapy.pipelines.images import FilesPipeline

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    
        
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, image)
            image = background
        else:
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

With this corrected code, the function now correctly handles different image formats and modes and creates the thumbnails accordingly.
