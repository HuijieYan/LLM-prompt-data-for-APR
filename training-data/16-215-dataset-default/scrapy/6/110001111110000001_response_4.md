The buggy function `convert_image` is designed to convert images to the desired format and size. The error message indicates that the test case is failing because the function is not producing the expected results.

After analyzing the function and the failing test, it seems that the bug is likely in the conditional statement that checks for PNG format and RGBA mode. When the image is in PNG format and RGBA mode, the function is supposed to convert it to RGB format and set a white background before converting it to JPEG. However, the current implementation does not correctly handle this conversion, which is causing the test case to fail.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the conversion of PNG format images with RGBA mode to RGB format with a white background.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the conditional statement that handles PNG format and RGBA mode images. We can create a new image with a white background, paste the original image onto the new background, and then convert the image to RGB format. This will ensure that images with PNG format and RGBA mode are correctly converted to RGB format with a white background.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected implementation, the `convert_image` function should now handle image conversions properly and pass the failing test.
