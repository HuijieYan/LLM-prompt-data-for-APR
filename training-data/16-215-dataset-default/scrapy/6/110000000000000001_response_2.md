1. The buggy function is intended to convert an input image to a new format and size while maintaining its proportions. However, there are some issues with the conditional statements and the use of the Image module.

2. Potential error locations within the function include the conditional statements for checking the image format and mode, as well as the image resizing and conversion operations.

3. The potential causes of the bug are:
   (a) Improper conditional checks for image format and mode
   (b) Incorrect usage of the Image module functions
   (c) The output format for the saved image is hardcoded as 'JPEG'

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a) Correct the conditional checks for image format and mode
   (b) Ensure proper usage of the Image module functions for pasting, conversion, and resizing
   (c) Make the output format dynamic based on user input

5. Corrected code:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    format = "JPEG" if image.format is None else image.format   # dynamic output format
    image.save(buf, format)
    buf.seek(0)  # reset buffer position to the beginning
    return image, buf
```
