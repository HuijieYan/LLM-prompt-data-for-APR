The issue with the buggy function is that it doesn't properly handle image conversion and thumbnail creation for certain image formats and modes. The function should convert PNG images with an RGBA mode to RGB and create thumbnails for all images with the correct size.

To fix the bug, the function needs to check the image format and mode and handle them accordingly. We also need to ensure that the thumbnail is created with the correct size.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO
from scrapy.pipelines.files import FilesPipeline

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, image)
            image = background
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

By using the `Image.new` function to create a new RGB image and the `paste` function to paste the original image onto it, we ensure that PNG images with an RGBA mode are properly converted to RGB. We also correctly create the thumbnail by using the `thumbnail` function with the specified size.

With these changes, the function should now produce the expected results for all the provided cases.
