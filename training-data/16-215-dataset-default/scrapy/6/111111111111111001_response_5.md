The buggy function `convert_image` has two main issues that cause the failing tests:

1. The function doesn't handle the case when the input `image.format` is 'JPEG' and the `image.mode` is already 'RGB'. In this case, the function should just return the original image without any conversion.

2. When converting images of format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA', the logic for creating a background and converting the image to RGB is incorrect, leading to an incorrect output.

To solve these issues, the following corrective steps should be taken:

1. Update the condition for 'JPEG' format and 'RGB' mode to return the original image without any conversion.

2. Correct the logic for handling 'PNG' format and 'RGBA' mode to properly handle transparency and convert the image to RGB.

The corrected code for the `convert_image` function is provided below:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'JPEG' and image.mode == 'RGB':
        return image, None  # Return the original image if format is JPEG and mode is RGB

    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With these changes, the `convert_image` function should now correctly handle the different image format and mode cases, and should pass the failing test cases provided.
