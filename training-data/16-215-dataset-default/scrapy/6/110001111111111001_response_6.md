The issue with the `convert_image` function is that it incorrectly handles images with a format of 'PNG' and a mode of 'RGBA'. When these conditions are met, it is attempting to convert the image to 'RGB' without considering the alpha channel, resulting in a loss of transparency. Additionally, when resizing an image, it is not taking into account the aspect ratio, leading to distorted thumbnails.

To fix the bug, we should change the logic to properly handle images with different modes and sizes.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `convert_image` function as follows:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a new RGBA image with a white background and paste the original image onto it
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    if size:
        # Calculate the thumbnail size while preserving the aspect ratio
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    # Convert the image to RGB
    image = image.convert('RGB')

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With these changes, the `convert_image` function should now handle images with different modes and sizes correctly, and the failing test should pass.
