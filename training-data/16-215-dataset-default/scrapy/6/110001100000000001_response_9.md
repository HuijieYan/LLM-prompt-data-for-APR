1. The buggy function takes an image and an optional size parameter, and converts the image to a specific format and size. It uses the Pillow library for image manipulation.

2. The potential error location within the function is the conversion of the image to RGBA format and then immediately converting it back to RGB format.

3. The cause of the bug is that when the image is in PNG format and RGBA mode, the function creates a new RGBA background and pastes the original image onto it, then converts the image to RGB. The bug is caused by the incorrect use of the `paste` method, which should take a tuple (x, y) as the second argument, representing the upper left corner to paste the image at.

4. To fix the bug, we need to correctly paste the image onto the background and convert the image to RGB if it is in a different mode. In addition, we need to handle the size parameter for thumbnailing the image correctly.

5. Corrected code:
```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))  # Corrected paste method usage
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected code, we are correctly pasting the image onto the background and handling the conversion to RGB. We also handle the thumbnailing of the image based on the size parameter.
