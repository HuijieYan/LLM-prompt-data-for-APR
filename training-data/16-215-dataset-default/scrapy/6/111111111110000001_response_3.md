The `convert_image` function takes an image as input and converts it to a specific format and size. 

The potential errors in the function are likely related to the conditional statements that handle image format and mode conversion. The function may not be correctly handling the transformation of images from PNG with RGBA mode to JPEG with RGB mode. 

The failing test is attempting to convert images of different formats and modes, and verify that the resulting images match the expected format and color. The error message indicates that the output of the function does not match the expected values.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to update the conditional statements in the `convert_image` function to handle the transformation of images from RGBA mode to RGB mode for PNG images. Additionally, the function should correctly handle the conversion of image sizes.

Below is the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    from PIL import Image, ImageOps

    if image.mode == 'RGBA' or (image.mode == 'P' and 'transparency' in image.info):
        image = image.convert('RGBA')
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        image = Image.alpha_composite(background, image)
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = ImageOps.fit(image, size, method=Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected code, the PIL library is used to ensure proper handling of image format and mode conversion. The code first checks if the image mode is RGBA or has transparency, and then performs the alpha composition and format conversion accordingly. The image size is then adjusted using the `ImageOps.fit` method. This corrected code should pass the failing test.
