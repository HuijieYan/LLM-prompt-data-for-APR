1. The provided function is meant to convert an image to RGB format, resize it if necessary, and save it as a JPEG. The potential error location seems to be in the `convert_image` function where it is attempting to convert images to RGB format and resizing them.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is at the line `background.paste(image, image)`. This line seems redundant and could be causing issues when trying to convert the image to RGB format.

3. The bug's cause seems to be the incorrect usage of the `paste` method on the `background` object, which is not necessary and could be causing the image to not be converted properly to RGB format. Additionally, the function should be handling the resizing of the image differently.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include removing the redundant `background.paste(image, image)` line, and properly handling the resizing of the image using the `thumbnail` method. Additionally, the function could be improved by handling errors and checking for the image format before attempting to convert it.

5. Corrected code:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

class ImageProcessor:
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

In the corrected code, the redundant `background.paste(image, image)` line has been replaced with `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)`. Additionally, the function has been placed within a class for better organization and encapsulation of the image processing functionality.
