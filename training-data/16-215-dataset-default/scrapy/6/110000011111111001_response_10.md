The buggy function has several issues. First, the conditional check for the image format and mode is not correct. It should be checking for 'PNG' and 'RGBA', not 'JPEG' and 'RGB'. Additionally, the paste method should not pass the image as a second argument. Instead, the argument should be a tuple representing the position. Finally, the `image.save()` method should be called with the `quality` parameter set to a specific value to ensure it is properly saved as a JPEG.

The failing test is encountering issues when comparing the converted colors in the images, suggesting that the images are not being converted correctly. This could be due to the incorrect handling of the image format and mode.

To fix the bug, the conditions for checking the image format and mode should be corrected, and the `image.save()` method should be called with the `quality` parameter set to a specific value.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.format == 'JPEG' and image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    # Set quality to 95 to ensure proper JPEG conversion
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG', quality=95)
    return image, buf
``` 

This corrected code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
