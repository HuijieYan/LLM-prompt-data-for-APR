1. The buggy function is part of the `ImagesPipeline` class which is a subclass of `FilesPipeline`. The function is designed to convert an image to a specific format and size. It uses the PIL library to manipulate and save images.

2. The potential error is in the image conversion logic, where it checks for the image format and mode and then converts the image accordingly.

3. The cause of the bug could be due to the incorrect handling of image format and mode. The function may not be handling certain image formats or modes properly, leading to incorrect image conversion.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Correctly handle different image formats and modes.
   - Use proper condition checks and image conversion methods.

5. Corrected code:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO
from scrapy.pipelines.files import FilesPipeline

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

In the corrected code, the `paste` method has been updated to correctly paste the image onto the background. Additionally, the `image.mode` check has been corrected to handle non-RGB modes properly. The `convert` and `thumbnail` methods are used with the correct parameters for image conversion and resizing.
