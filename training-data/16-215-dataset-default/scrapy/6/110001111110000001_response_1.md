The buggy function `convert_image` is responsible for converting images to different formats and sizes. The function seems to be failing when converting images with transparency into JPG format. The error message indicates that the color values are not as expected when converting RGBA images to RGB.

The potential error location is in the conditional statement that handles images with a format of 'PNG' and a mode of 'RGBA'. When this condition is met, the function creates a new RGBA image with a white background and pastes the original image onto it. However, the following code `background.paste(image, image)` should instead be `background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)`, as the second argument is the position to paste the image.

The bug is causing incorrect conversion of RGBA images to RGB by not handling transparency properly, leading to incorrect color values.

To fix the bug, we need to correctly handle the transparency when converting from RGBA to RGB. This can be achieved by specifying the position when pasting the image onto the background. Additionally, we should check the original image's mode before converting it to RGB to ensure that images with a different mode than RGB are handled properly.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With these changes, the function should correctly handle transparency and pass the failing test.
