The buggy function is `convert_image` which is inside the class `ImagesPipeline`. The function takes an image and size as input, converts the image to RGB mode if it is not already in RGB mode and creates its thumbnail with the provided size then saves it in JPEG format.

The potential error in the function is the part where it checks for PNG format and RGBA mode. The condition `if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':` is checking for PNG format but it should be checking for image mode since the image format doesn't specify the color palette. Also, there is a mistake in the background.paste() function where it should take (0,0) as position parameter, but is currently incorrectly taking the image as the position parameter.

The class `ImagesPipeline` extends `FilesPipeline` and it seems that the `_create_image` function mentioned in the failing test is also involved in creating test images for testing `convert_image`.

The failing test checks for image modes and colors after conversion, thumbnails, and transparency, and it is failing because the `convert_image` function is not producing the expected results.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly check for the image mode, handle RGBA mode and thumbnail generation for transparency, and ensure that it saves the image in the JPEG format.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageOps

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.mode == 'RGBA':
            image = Image.alpha_composite(Image.new("RGB", image.size, (255, 255, 255)), image).convert("RGB")
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = ImageOps.fit(image, size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

This corrected function checks for RGBA mode correctly and handles transparency. It also creates a thumbnail with the given size and saves the image in JPEG format. This correction should make the function pass the failing test.
