The issue with the buggy function is that it does not handle all image formats and modes correctly. Additionally, the image.thumbnail operation is not preserving the aspect ratio as expected in Case 2.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

class ImageProcessor:

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
    
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

In this corrected version, we have created a `ImageProcessor` class and moved the `convert_image` function inside it. We also added additional checks for different image formats and modes. We've also adjusted the handling of transparency and aspect ratio preservation for thumbnails.

This corrected version should now handle all input cases correctly.

The failing tests should all pass with this corrected version.
