1. The buggy function takes an image and a size as input and is supposed to convert the image to RGB format and resize it to the specified size, if provided.

2. The potential error location is within the if statement that checks for the image format and mode.

3. The bug's cause is due to the incorrect usage of the paste method and the mishandling of the image format and mode.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Correctly use the paste method to add the image onto the background.
   - Handle the image format and mode properly to ensure correct conversion.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageOps
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected code:
- We use the paste method correctly to add the image onto the background.
- We handle the image format and mode properly to ensure correct conversion.
