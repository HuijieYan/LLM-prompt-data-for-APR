The bug in the `convert_image` function is that the code is not handling the JPEG format correctly. When the input image is in JPEG format, it should not be converted to RGB mode again. The function is also not handling transparency correctly for PNG images.

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of different image formats and modes in the `convert_image` function.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `convert_image` function to correctly handle different image formats and modes.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO
from PIL import ImageFile

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        image = image.convert('RGBA')
        if size:
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

By using the `convert` method to convert the input image to the RGBA mode, irrespective of the format and mode of the original image. This ensures that transparency is handled correctly for PNG images, and unnecessary mode conversions for JPEG images are prevented.

This corrected code should fix the bug and make the failing test pass.
