The issue with the original `convert_image` function is that it doesn't correctly handle PNG images with RGBA mode. It should create a new RGBA background and paste the original image onto it before converting it to RGB.

The failing test is hitting this bug because it's trying to compare the colors of the original and converted images, which are not matching due to the incorrect handling of RGBA images.

To fix the bug, the `convert_image` function should be updated to:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO
from scrapy.pipelines.images import FilesPipeline

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

With this updated function, it correctly handles PNG images with RGBA mode, creating a new RGBA background and pasting the original image onto it before converting it to RGB. This will ensure that the test cases will pass and the function will produce the expected results.
