The buggy function has a few issues. Firstly, when trying to check the image format, it should compare to 'JPEG' instead of 'PNG'. Additionally, the background image is being created with an incorrect mode. Lastly, for the case where size is provided, the image should be resized while maintaining the aspect ratio.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the image mode check and the image resizing.

The cause of the bug is that the code is not correctly handling different image formats and modes, and the resizing is not maintaining the aspect ratio.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
1. Update the condition to check if the image format is 'JPEG' instead of 'PNG'.
2. Create the background image with the correct mode based on the input image mode.
3. Use the `thumbnail` method to resize the image while maintaining the aspect ratio.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageFile
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'JPEG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```
