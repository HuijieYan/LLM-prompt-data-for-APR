To fix the buggy function, we need to make sure that the `Image` class is imported from the `PIL` library, and also apply the necessary changes to the `if-elif` conditions. Below is the corrected version of the function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    else:
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)
    return image, buf
```

The changes made include importing the `Image` class from the `PIL` library, modifying the conditions for handling PNG and RGBA images, and making sure to return the buffer with its position set to 0 after saving the image.
