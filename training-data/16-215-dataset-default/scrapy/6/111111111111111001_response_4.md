The issue with the buggy function lies in the `convert_image` method. When the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', the function is creating a new image with a white background and pasting the original image onto it. However, it should be using the `paste` method to paste the original image onto the white background, rather than passing the image as a second argument to the `paste` method, which is causing the incorrect conversion of the image. Additionally, when the mode of the image is not 'RGB', the function should be converting it to 'RGB' immediately without going into the `if size` block.

Furthermore, the function should return both the modified `image` and `buf`.

To fix this, we need to update the conversion logic in the function and return the converted `image` and `buf` as expected by the failing test cases.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO
from scrapy.pipelines.files import FilesPipeline

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implements the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

This corrected version of the function addresses the issues with the original code. It correctly handles the conversion of images with different formats and modes, and it returns both the modified `image` and `buf` as expected by the failing test cases. With these changes, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
