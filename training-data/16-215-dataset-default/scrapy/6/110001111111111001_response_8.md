The issue with the buggy function is that in the case where the image format is PNG and the mode is RGBA, it is being converted to RGB mode, but the alpha channel is not being handled properly. This results in incorrect colors when getcolors() is called.

To fix this, we need to ensure that the alpha channel is properly handled when converting from RGBA to RGB.

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageFile
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```
In this corrected code, when converting from RGBA to RGB, we create the background with an alpha channel filled with 255 (fully opaque) to handle the alpha channel properly.

This should resolve the issue and make the function pass the failing test.
