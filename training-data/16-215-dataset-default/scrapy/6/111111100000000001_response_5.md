1. The buggy function `convert_image` is a method of the `ImagesPipeline` class. It is intended to convert images to a specific format and size, and then save them to a buffer. The class `ImagesPipeline` seems to be a subclass of `FilesPipeline`, but the code for `FilesPipeline` is not provided.

2. The potential error location within the `convert_image` function could be in the conditional statements that check the image format and mode, as well as in the image conversion and saving process.

3. The bug's cause may be due to the following reasons:
   (a). The conditional statement may not be correctly identifying the image format and mode.
   (b). The image conversion process may not be functioning as intended, causing errors in the output.
   (c). The saving process could be incorrect, resulting in a corrupted image buffer.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Review the conditional statements to ensure they are correctly identifying the image format and mode.
   (b). Test the image conversion process with different image formats and modes to identify any potential errors.
   (c). Verify the saving process to ensure that the image buffer is being properly saved in the specified format.

5. Corrected code:
```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO
from scrapy.pipelines.files import FilesPipeline

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implements the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0, image.size[0], image.size[1]))
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        buf.seek(0)  # Move the pointer to the start of the buffer
        return image, buf
```

In the corrected code, the `paste` method in the conditional statement has been updated to correctly position the pasted image. Additionally, the `buf.seek(0)` line has been added to move the pointer to the start of the buffer before returning it. This should fix the issues with the original function.
