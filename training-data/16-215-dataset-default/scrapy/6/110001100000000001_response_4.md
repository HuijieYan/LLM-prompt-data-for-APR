1. The buggy function `convert_image` is supposed to handle image conversion and resizing. The potential error is likely to be in the section that handles image format and mode conversions.

2. The potential error location is within the `if` and `elif` statements that check the image format and mode.

3. The bug's cause is likely due to incorrect conditions within the `if` and `elif` statements. It seems that the code is not handling the image format and mode conversion correctly, leading to issues with the output.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Ensure the condition for checking the image format and mode is correct and inclusive of all relevant cases.
   - Verify that the image format and mode conversion operations are being applied accurately.
   - Consider using an image processing library, such as Pillow, to handle the image conversion and resizing operations more effectively.

5. Corrected code:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)  # Move the pointer to the start of the buffer
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected code:
- The condition for checking the image format and mode is corrected.
- The image format and mode conversion operations are handled accurately using the Pillow library.
- The created image buffer is moved to the start using `buf.seek(0)` to ensure the correct output.
