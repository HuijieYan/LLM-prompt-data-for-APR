Potential error location: The potential error in the function is in the image.save() method where the file type is specified as JPEG, regardless of the original image type. This could result in a mismatch between the image type and the specified file type.

Bug's cause:
(a). The buggy function "convert_image" is responsible for converting images to a specified size and format. However, the image.save() method specifies the file type as JPEG, which may not match the original image type.
(b). The buggy class "ImagesPipeline" is meant to implement the image thumbnail generation logic, but the convert_image function has the aforementioned issue.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Check the original format of the image before saving it and save it in the same format.
2. Add error handling for unsupported image formats.
3. Ensure that the size parameter is properly handled for image thumbnails.

Corrected code:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO
from scrapy.pipelines.files import FilesPipeline

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, format=image.format)  # Save image in its original format
        buf.seek(0)
        return image, buf
```
In the corrected code, the image.save() method uses the original image format to save the file. Additionally, error handling for unsupported image formats can be added based on specific application requirements.
