The issue with the buggy function seems to be that the condition to check for image format and mode is incorrect, leading to incorrect image conversion and results. It seems that if the input image is in JPEG format and not in RGB mode, it should be converted to RGB mode. However, the current code does not handle this properly. Additionally, the code to handle PNG images with RGBA mode is also incorrect.

It is also noted that the `background.paste` method should take the second argument as (0, 0) instead of image, which is currently resulting in incorrect conversion.

To fix the bug, we need to update the condition check for JPEG images and the conversion for PNG images with RGBA mode.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'JPEG' and image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')
    
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0))
        image = background.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected code, the function should now properly handle the conversion of images to the desired format and mode. This should resolve the failing test cases and the provided expected input/output variable information.
