Potential error location - The bug seems to be located in the `convert_image` function within the `ImagesPipeline` class. The issue seems to arise from the conversion of images with transparency into RGB format and the thumbnail size calculation that is not maintaining the image ratio.

Bug's cause:
(a). The `convert_image` function is converting images with the format 'PNG' and mode 'RGBA' to RGB format, which is causing a discrepancy in the color values when the test compares the converted colors.
(b). The related function `_create_image` is used to create test images for the failing test, but the issue lies within the `convert_image` function itself.
(c). The test `test_convert_image` is checking for the converted colors and size of images after the conversion, which is failing due to incorrect conversion and thumbnail size calculation in the `convert_image` function.
(d). The error message indicates that the lists of colors are different, which means that the conversion is not happening as expected, and the thumbnail size calculation is also incorrect.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Handle the conversion of images with transparency in a way that maintains the color values.
2. Adjust the logic for calculating the thumbnail size to maintain the image ratio.

Corrected code for the problematic function: `convert_image`

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageOps
from io import BytesIO
import numpy as np

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.mode == 'RGBA':
            # Create a white background for the image
            image = Image.alpha_composite(Image.new("RGB", image.size, (255, 255, 255)), image)
        # Convert the image to RGB mode
        image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            thumb = ImageOps.fit(image, size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        else:
            thumb = image

        buf = BytesIO()
        thumb.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return thumb, buf
```

This modified `convert_image` function handles images with transparency by creating a white background and then compositing the original image on top of it. It also correctly calculates the thumbnail size and maintains the image ratio using `ImageOps.fit`.
