1. The buggy function `convert_image` is intended to convert an image to a different format and size if specified. The failing test checks for different scenarios where the function should convert the images correctly, but it fails with an error message related to the color difference in the converted image.

2. The potential error location within the function is likely when the function is supposed to handle images with transparency (RGBA mode) and convert them to RGB mode.

3. The bug's cause is that when the function converts an image from RGBA to RGB, it doesn't handle the transparency correctly, resulting in a different color being returned than expected.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Check for the presence of an alpha channel in the image and handle transparency appropriately when converting from RGBA to RGB.
   b. Ensure that the conversion process accurately maintains the color integrity of the image.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))  # Create a new RGB background
        background.paste(image, mask=image.split()[3])  # Paste the image with alpha channel as the mask
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)  # Move the buffer pointer to the beginning
    return image, buf
```

This corrected code includes handling transparency when converting from RGBA to RGB by creating a new RGB background and pasting the original image onto it with the alpha channel as the mask. This ensures that the color integrity is maintained during the conversion.
