The problem with the current function is that it does not handle PNG images with RGBA format correctly. It converts the image to RGB, but it should replace the alpha channel with a white background instead.

The failing test is returning different values than expected because the function's logic to convert PNG images with RGBA format to RGB is incorrect.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the function to handle PNG images with RGBA format differently. Instead of directly converting them to RGB, we should first create a new RGBA image with a white background and then paste the original image over it. After this step, we can convert the result to RGB format.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, format='JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected code, the function should now handle PNG images with RGBA format correctly and should pass the failing test.
