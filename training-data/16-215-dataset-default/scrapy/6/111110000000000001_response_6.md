1. The buggy function is part of the ImagesPipeline class, which is meant to implement the image thumbnail generation logic. The function takes an image and an optional size parameter, converts the image to RGB format, creates a thumbnail of the image, and then saves it as a JPEG.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the image.save(buf, 'JPEG') line. It is attempting to save the image to JPEG format, but it should be checking the image's format and saving accordingly.

3. The bug's cause could be that the function is always trying to save the image in JPEG format, regardless of its original format. This could lead to errors if the original image is not in the RGB format.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Check the original image format before attempting to save it as a JPEG.
   b. Update the function to save the image in the original format, or convert it to the desired format before saving.

5. Corrected code:
```python
class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implements the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        
        if image.format:
            format = image.format
        else:
            format = 'JPEG'
        
        image.save(buf, format)
        return image, buf
```

In the corrected code, we are first checking if the image has a format attribute, and if not, defaulting to 'JPEG'. This ensures that the image is saved in the original format if it has one, or as a JPEG if it does not. This fixes the bug by properly handling the image format when saving.
