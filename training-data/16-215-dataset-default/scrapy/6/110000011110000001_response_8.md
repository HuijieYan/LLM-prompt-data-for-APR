1. The buggy function `convert_image` takes an image and an optional size as input, and then converts the image to RGB format and resizes it if a size is provided. The failing test `test_convert_image` calls this function with different types of images and checks if the conversion and resizing are done correctly.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is in the logic for handling images with transparency (PNG and RGBA). It seems that the function is not correctly handling the transparency in these images, which causes the failing test to produce incorrect results.

3. The bug is caused by the mishandling of images with transparency in the function `convert_image`. The failing test indicates that the function is not properly converting images with transparency to RGB format and resizing them as expected.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Check the logic for handling images with transparency and ensure that it properly converts transparent images to RGB format.
   - Verify that the resizing logic is appropriate for images with transparency and that it maintains the transparency when resizing.
   - Fix any issues related to the usage of the `Image` module in the function.

5. Corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageOps

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode == 'RGBA' or (image.format == 'PNG' and 'transparency' in image.info):
        # Convert transparent images to RGB while preserving transparency
        new_image = Image.new("RGB", image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        new_image.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = new_image
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = ImageOps.exif_transpose(image)
        image = image.resize(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected code handles transparent images separately and converts them to RGB format while preserving the transparency. It also handles resizing of the images correctly. This should address the issues identified in the failing test and error message.
