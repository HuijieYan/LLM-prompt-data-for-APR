The provided buggy function `convert_image` is designed to convert images to a specified format and size. However, there are a few issues in the function that cause it to fail the given test.

The potential error location within the function is the part where it handles PNG images with RGBA mode. The function attempts to convert such images into RGB mode but loses the alpha channel information during the conversion, resulting in incorrect colors in the output image.

The failing test checks for this issue by comparing the converted image's colors, and it fails due to the loss of alpha channel information.

To fix the bug, one approach is to modify the function to properly handle the conversion of RGBA images to RGB without losing the alpha channel information.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageOps
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        # Create a new RGBA image with a white background
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        # Composite the original image onto the new background, preserving the alpha channel
        composed = Image.alpha_composite(background, image)
        # Convert the composed image to RGB mode
        image = composed.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With the corrected code, the function should now properly handle the conversion of RGBA images to RGB mode without losing the alpha channel information, and it should pass the failing test.
