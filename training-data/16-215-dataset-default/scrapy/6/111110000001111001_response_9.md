The issue with the `convert_image` function is that when `image.format` is `'PNG'` and `image.mode` is `'RGBA'`, it creates a new RGBA background and pastes the image onto it, and then converts it to RGB mode. This is problematic because the new background is unnecessary and causes a change in the image's mode.

To fix this, we can simplify the function by directly converting the image to RGB if its mode is not already RGB, and then resizing the image if a size is provided.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from io import BytesIO
from PIL import Image
from scrapy.pipelines.images import FilesPipeline

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

With this correction, the function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided for all the test cases.
