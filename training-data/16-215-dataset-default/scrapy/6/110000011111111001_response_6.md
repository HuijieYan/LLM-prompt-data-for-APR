The potential error in the buggy function seems to be in handling different image formats and modes.

The failing test is raising an assertion error related to the converted image's colors not matching the expected colors. This could be due to issues when handling transparent images with different modes.

The discrepancies between expected and actual input/output variable values indicate that the function is not properly handling the conversion of images with different modes and sizes.

To fix the bug, we can add specific conversions for different image types and modes using the Image module from the PIL library.

Here's the corrected code for the function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background.convert('RGB')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With this corrected code, the function should now properly handle different image formats and modes and pass the failing test case.
