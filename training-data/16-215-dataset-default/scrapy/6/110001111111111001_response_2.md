The problem with the provided function is that it is not handling the transparency correctly and is dropping it during the image conversion.

The issue seems to be with the condition where it converts the image format from PNG to RGB with an alpha channel, and it is not retaining the alpha channel in the resulting image. The resulting image should have an alpha channel as well to retain the transparency.

Since the function is converting the image to RGB, it will always lose any transparency information. It should be modified to convert the image to RGBA instead of just RGB to retain the alpha channel.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

# this is the fixed function
def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, image)
        image = background.convert('RGBA')
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

This corrected code includes the necessary changes to retain the transparency of the image during the conversion. Now the function should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
