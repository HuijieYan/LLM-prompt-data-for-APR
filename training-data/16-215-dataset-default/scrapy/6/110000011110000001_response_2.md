1. The buggy function `convert_image` takes an image and an optional size, then converts the input image to a JPEG format, resizes it if a size is provided, and returns the converted image along with a buffer. The failing test is testing different image formats and sizes, as well as the correctness of the conversion.

2. The potential error location within the `convert_image` function is the conditional statement that checks if the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'. There is an issue with converting the image and pasting it onto a new background. The error is likely to occur in this conditional block.

3. The bug's cause is that the conversion in the conditional statement is incorrectly altering the image and not handling transparency properly. This is apparent in the failing test with the comparison of colors failing and indicating that the conversion process is not working as expected.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Handling transparency properly when converting images from RGBA to RGB.
   - Ensuring that the conversion from RGBA to RGB accurately represents the original colors.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image, ImageFile
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    # Creating a new instance of ImageFile so it can read large images
    ImageFile.LOAD_TRUNCATED_IMAGES = True
    
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)

    return image, buf
```

With this corrected code, the `convert_image` function should pass the failing test.
