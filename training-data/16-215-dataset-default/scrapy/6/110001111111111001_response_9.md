The issue with the `convert_image` function is that the code assumes it is always dealing with RGB or RGBA images, and it doesn't handle images with the mode 'P' properly. Additionally, in the size check, it is not considering the aspect ratio of the image, which causes the test case to fail.

To fix the function, we need to handle the case where the image mode is 'P' and also modify the code to maintain the aspect ratio when resizing the image.

Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.mode in ['P', 'RGBA']:
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    return image, buf
```

With these changes, the function should now handle different image modes properly and maintain the aspect ratio when resizing. This should make the function pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
