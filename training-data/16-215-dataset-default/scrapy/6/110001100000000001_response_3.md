1. The buggy function is meant to convert images to RGB format and resize them if necessary. It checks the format and mode of the image and performs conversions accordingly. The potential error location could be in the conversion logic and the resizing logic.

2. The potential error location is within the if-else statements that check the image format and mode, and the logic for resizing the image.

3. The bug's cause is that the condition for checking image format and mode is not accurate, and the resizing logic may not be correctly implemented. The code may not be handling all possible image formats and modes correctly.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include: performing accurate checks for image formats and modes, handling all possible image formats and modes, and revisiting the logic for resizing the image to ensure it works as intended.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
    if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
        background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
        background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
        image = background
    elif image.mode != 'RGB':
        image = image.convert('RGB')

    if size:
        image = image.copy()
        image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

    buf = BytesIO()
    image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
    buf.seek(0)
    return image, buf
```

In the corrected code:
- The condition for checking the image format and mode has been adjusted to handle PNG images with RGBA mode more accurately.
- The conversion of the background image has been modified to handle PNG images with RGBA mode correctly.
- The resizing logic has been left unchanged as it was not part of the bug.
- The corrected function should now accurately handle image format and mode conversions and properly resize the images.
