The buggy function `convert_image` is part of the `ImagesPipeline` class which is supposed to implement image thumbnail generation logic.

The potential error in the function lies in the if-elif-else statement. The first if condition checks the image format and mode, and if it meets the condition, it converts the image to RGB format. However, the elif condition checks if the image mode is not RGB, but if the first condition fails, the image is already in RGB format. This could lead to unnecessary conversion of the image format.

The bug is caused by the incorrect handling of the image format and mode, leading to unnecessary conversion of the image.

One approach to fix the bug is to remove the elif condition and simply convert the image to RGB format if it is not already in that format. Additionally, the function should handle the PNG format properly. 

Here's the corrected code:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO
from scrapy.pipelines.files import FilesPipeline

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```
