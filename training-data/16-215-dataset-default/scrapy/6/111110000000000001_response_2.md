1. The buggy function is part of the ImagesPipeline class and is responsible for converting images to a specified size and format.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the conditional statement that checks if the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA'.

3. The potential cause of the bug is that if the image format is 'PNG' and the mode is 'RGBA', the function attempts to convert the image to RGB format, but the 'paste' method is being used incorrectly, which can cause unexpected behavior. This can lead to incorrect image conversion and potential data loss.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Using the correct syntax for the 'paste' method to overlay the image onto the background.
   - Checking for errors in the conditional statement and handling them appropriately.
   - Using try-except blocks to catch any potential errors during image conversion and handling them gracefully.

5. Corrected code:
```python
from io import BytesIO
from PIL import Image
from scrapy.pipelines.images import FilesPipeline

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
        
    """
    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')
    
        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
    
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
```

In the corrected code, the 'paste' method is used with the correct syntax to overlay the image onto the background. Additionally, the conditional statement is checked for potential errors and corrected to handle the image conversion appropriately.
