1. The buggy function is called convert_image and it is part of the ImagesPipeline class, which is a subclass of FilesPipeline. This function is intended to convert images to the JPEG format and resize them if necessary.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the image.save(buf, 'JPEG') line, as it is attempting to save the image in JPEG format regardless of the original image format.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function is trying to save the image as JPEG without checking the original image format. This can cause an error if the original image is not in a format that can be converted to JPEG. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the size is None, causing potential errors if size is not specified.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking the original image format before attempting to save it as JPEG
   - Handling the case where size is None
   - Modifying the function to use a try-except block to catch any errors when saving the image as JPEG

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO
from scrapy.pipelines.files import FilesPipeline

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGBA', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, image)
            image = background.convert('RGB')
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image = image.copy()
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)

        buf = BytesIO()
        try:
            image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        except IOError:
            image.save(buf, image.format)
        return image, buf
```

In the corrected code, we added a try-except block to catch any IOError when attempting to save the image as JPEG. If an error occurs, it will attempt to save the image in its original format. We also handled the case where size is None, so that the function can work properly even if size is not specified.
