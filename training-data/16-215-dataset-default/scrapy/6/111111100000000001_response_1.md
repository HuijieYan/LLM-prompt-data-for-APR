1. The buggy function `convert_image` is a method within the `ImagesPipeline` class, which is supposed to implement the image thumbnail generation logic.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of image formats and mode conversions.

3. The bug's cause is that the function does not properly handle the conversion of images to the desired format and mode, leading to incorrect image processing and output. The function also does not handle the size parameter properly, which may result in unexpected behavior when generating image thumbnails.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Ensuring that the image format and mode are correctly handled, especially when converting to RGB from PNG with RGBA mode.
   - Properly handling the size parameter for generating image thumbnails.
   - Checking for any other potential issues related to image processing.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `convert_image` function:

```python
from PIL import Image
from io import BytesIO

class ImagesPipeline(FilesPipeline):
    """
    Abstract pipeline that implement the image thumbnail generation logic
    """

    def convert_image(self, image, size=None):
        if image.format == 'PNG' and image.mode == 'RGBA':
            background = Image.new('RGB', image.size, (255, 255, 255))
            background.paste(image, (0, 0), image)
            image = background
        elif image.mode != 'RGB':
            image = image.convert('RGB')

        if size:
            image.thumbnail(size, Image.ANTIALIAS)
        
        buf = BytesIO()
        image.save(buf, 'JPEG')
        return image, buf
``` 

In the corrected code:
- The image mode and format conversions are handled properly, with the RGBA mode being converted to RGB and the PNG format being handled.
- The size parameter for generating image thumbnails is properly handled.
- The corrected function now returns the processed image and buffer.
