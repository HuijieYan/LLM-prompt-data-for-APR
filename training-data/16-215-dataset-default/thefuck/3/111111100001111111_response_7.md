The potential error in the buggy function is that it is not correctly capturing the version string for the Fish shell, resulting in an incorrect return value. This is likely causing the recursive loop mentioned in the GitHub issue.

To fix this bug, the `info` function needs to capture the correct version string for the Fish shell and return it in the expected format.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-v'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell, version {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected code ensures that the `info` function captures the correct version of the Fish shell and returns it in the expected format. It should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub thread and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
