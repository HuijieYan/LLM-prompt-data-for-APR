Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the command used to get the Fish shell version. The Popen command is not providing the expected output.

Bug cause: The function is not correctly capturing the Fish shell version, which causes the incorrect output.

Proposed approach for fixing the bug: Use the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version and update the function to return the expected version string.

Corrected code:

```python
from subprocess import run, PIPE

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = run(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, text=True)
    version = proc.stdout.strip()
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

This corrected code should retrieve the Fish shell version using the correct command and return the expected version string. It should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
