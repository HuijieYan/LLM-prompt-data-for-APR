Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell in the `info` function. It is currently using `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but the test is expecting the version to be retrieved using `fish --version`.

Bug's cause: The `info` function is not returning the expected version string due to the discrepancy in the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell to `['fish', '--version']`.
2. Modify the `info` function to correctly read the version from the output of the command.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# this is the corrected function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

The corrected function uses the `['fish', '--version']` command to retrieve the version of the Fish shell, and then correctly parses the version from the output. This should resolve the issue reported in the failing test and the GitHub issue.
