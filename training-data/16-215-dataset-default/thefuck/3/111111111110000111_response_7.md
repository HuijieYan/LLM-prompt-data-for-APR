Analysis:
1. The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is trying to get the version of Fish Shell using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but it's mistakenly using `--version` in the test code. This inconsistency is causing the AssertionError.
2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the command used to retrieve the version of Fish Shell.

Bug's Cause:
(a). The buggy function tries to get the version of Fish Shell using the wrong command.
(b). The `Fish` class does not handle the command line call properly.
(c). The failing test is using the wrong command to verify the shell version, causing the test to fail.
(d). The error message indicates that the version retrieved is not as expected due to a wrong command.
(e). The GitHub issue suggests that using `thefuck -v` causes a recursive loop due to the buggy function.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Change the command used in the `info` function to use `--version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`.
2. Modify the `Popen` call to handle the correct command.
3. Update the failing test to reflect the correct command used to verify the shell version.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    # The corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected code will use the correct command to retrieve the version of Fish Shell and should pass the failing test. Additionally, it will resolve the issue posted on GitHub related to the recursive loop caused by the `thefuck -v` command.
