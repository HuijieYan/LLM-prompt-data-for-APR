1. The buggy function is a method called `info` within the `Fish` class. The function is intended to return the name and version of the current Fish shell. The GitHub issue reports that the usage of the `thefuck -v` command hangs the Fish Shell initialization when using the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of `Popen` to execute the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` and retrieve the output.

3. The cause of the bug is that when the `info` function is called, it triggers a recursive loop due to the way the `Popen` command is used to retrieve the Fish shell version. This causes the shell initialization to hang.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Using a different method to retrieve the Fish shell version that does not cause a recursive loop.
   - Modifying the way the command is executed in the `info` function to avoid hanging the shell.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import check_output, CalledProcessError

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):

    # the corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            version = check_output(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']).decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except CalledProcessError:
            return "Error retrieving Fish Shell version"
```
