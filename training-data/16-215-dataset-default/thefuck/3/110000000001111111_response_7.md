Analyzing the issue and the provided information, it appears that the problem lies in the `info()` function of the `Fish` class. The function is using the `Popen` class to execute a command to get the version of the Fish shell, but it is not providing the correct output. This causes the tests to fail and also triggers a recursive loop in the Oh-My-Fish's TheFuck plugin.

The discrepancy between the expected and actual input/output variable values indicates that the function is not retrieving the correct version of the Fish shell and is not formatting the output as expected.

The GitHub issue further clarifies that the problem with the function is causing a recursive loop when the TheFuck plugin uses the `-v` flag to decide when to regenerate functions.

To fix the bug, potential approaches could include:
1. Implementing proper error handling and error messages to identify any issues with the command execution.
2. Ensuring that the command executed to get the version of the Fish shell returns the expected output.
3. Formatting the output of the function to match the expected value.

Here's the corrected code for the `info()` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

class Fish:
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell, version {}'.format(version)
        except Exception as e:
            return "Error getting Fish shell version: {}".format(str(e))
```

This correction ensures that the function properly executes the command, retrieves the Fish shell version, and formats the output as expected. It also includes error handling to handle any issues with the command execution. This should resolve the issue with the TheFuck plugin and prevent the recursive loop, as well as provide the correct output as expected.
