The potential error location within the problematic function is on line 6 where it reads the output of the process and decodes it.

The cause of the bug is that the function is not correctly formatting the version string. The expected value includes the text "fish, version" before the actual version number, but the actual function only includes "Fish Shell" before the version number.

To fix the bug, the function needs to correctly format the version string to include "fish, version" before the actual version number.

One possible approach to fix the bug is to modify the return statement to include the correct formatting for the version string. Additionally, the function should be modified to properly use the Popen and communicate methods to ensure the output is read correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'fish, version {}'.format(version)
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly format the version string and retrieve the version number from the shell, resolving the issue reported on GitHub.
