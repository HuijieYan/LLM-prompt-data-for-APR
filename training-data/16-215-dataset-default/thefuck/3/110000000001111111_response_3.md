Potential error location:
The issue lies in the line where the version is being assigned. The current code uses 'echo $FISH_VERSION' in the command, but the expected value includes "fish, version" before the version number.

Bug's cause:
The current function does not include "fish, version" in the command to fetch the version, leading to a mismatch between the expected and actual output.

Suggested approach for fixing the bug:
To fix the bug, the function should be modified to include "fish, version" in the command used to fetch the version.

Corrected code:
```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo fish, version $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
