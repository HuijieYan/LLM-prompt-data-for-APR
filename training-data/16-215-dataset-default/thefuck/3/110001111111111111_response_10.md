Potential error location:
The issue is likely coming from the command used to get the fish version in the info() function. The command should be 'fish --version' instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION'.

Bug's cause:
The failing test expects the version string to be 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', but the current implementation is returning 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9' because the command used to get the fish version is not correct.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Update the command in the info() function to 'fish --version' to retrieve the correct version string.
2. Modify the return value in the info() function to match the expected format 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().replace('fish, version ', '')
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
``` 

The above corrected code updates the command to get the fish version and modifies the return value to match the expected format 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'. This should fix the bug and make the function pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information. Additionally, it should resolve the issue posted in GitHub regarding the usage of the 'thefuck' plugin with Oh-My-Fish.
