1. The buggy function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, but it is currently not working as intended.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of Popen and PIPE without importing the required modules.

3. The bug's cause is that the required modules (Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL) are not imported.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Import the required modules (Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL) from the subprocess module.
   - Use try-except blocks to handle any exceptions that may occur.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except Exception as e:
        return 'Error: {}'.format(str(e))
```
This corrected code imports the required modules from the subprocess module and uses a try-except block to handle any exceptions that may occur during the execution of the subprocess.
