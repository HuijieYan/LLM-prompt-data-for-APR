1. The `info` function is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` and capturing the output. The failing test is mocking the `Popen` object to return `b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'`, and then asserts that the output of `shell.info()` should be `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`.

2. The potential error location within the function is the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version. It seems that the command being used does not match the expected output format.

3. The cause of the bug is that the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell is incorrect, causing the `shell.info()` function to return an unexpected output.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Updating the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version to match the expected output format.
   - Adjusting the parsing of the output to properly extract the version number.

5. Corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(',')[1].strip()
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

With the corrected code, the function uses the command `fish --version` to retrieve the Fish shell version and then processes the output to extract the version number. This updated code should pass the failing test.
