1. The buggy function "info" is part of the Fish class in the fish.py file, within the "thefuck" program. The function is meant to return the name and version of the current shell by running the command "echo $FISH_VERSION", but it is causing a hang when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of Popen to execute a command and retrieve its output, which may be causing the hang.

3. The cause of the bug is related to the way the "info" function is retrieving the version of the shell using the Popen function. The GitHub issue indicates that this is causing a recursive loop when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin, leading to a hang. This shows that the bug is specific to the interaction of the "info" function with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include using a different method for retrieving the shell version, such as directly reading a file or environment variable, or using a different command to obtain the version information.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import check_output

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        version = check_output(['fish', '--version']).decode('utf-8').strip()
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected code, the check_output function is used to directly execute the command 'fish --version' and retrieve its output, eliminating the need for Popen and resolving the hang issue reported in the GitHub bug.
