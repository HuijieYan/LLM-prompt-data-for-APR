The issue in the buggy function is that it is using the incorrect command to get the Fish shell version. The `echo $FISH_VERSION` command should be changed to `fish --version`. Additionally, the incorrect expected value for the variable `version` should be fixed.

The potential error location is at the line:
```python
proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
```

The cause of the bug is that the `echo $FISH_VERSION` command does not return the correct Fish shell version. It should be using `fish --version` instead.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Change the command in the Popen call to `['fish', '--version']`.
2. Adjust the expected value for the `version` variable to `'3.5.9'`.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(' ')[2])
```

With this corrected code, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
