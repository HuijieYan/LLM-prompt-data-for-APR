# The corrected version of the buggy function
```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):

    # The corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

This corrected version of the function should fix the issue with obtaining the version of the Fish shell. The test should now pass without any assertion errors.
