Potential Error Location: The issue lies in the usage of the Popen function and the handling of the stdout.

Bug's Cause:
The function seems to be attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by using Popen with the command 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION'. However, the function fails to capture the correct version as it only retrieves '3.5.9' instead of 'fish, version 3.5.9'. This discrepancy causes the function to return an incorrect version of the shell.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
- Update the Popen command to 'fish -c echo fish, version $FISH_VERSION' to capture the correct output and version.
- Ensure proper decoding and stripping of the output to obtain the accurate version.

Corrected Code:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo fish, version $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

The corrected code modifies the Popen command to capture the correct version of the Fish shell and ensures proper handling of the stdout to decode and obtain the accurate version. This corrected code satisfies the expected input/output variable information provided and resolves the issue posted on GitHub regarding the thefuck -v hang in Fish Shell initialization with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.
