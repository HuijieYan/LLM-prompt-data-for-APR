The potential error in the buggy function lies in the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version. The correct command should be 'fish --version' instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION'.

The failing test is expecting the shell.info() method to return 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', but it is actually returning 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9' due to the incorrect command used to retrieve the version.

To fix the bug, we need to update the command to retrieve the Fish shell version by using 'fish --version' instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION'.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', ')[1])
```

With this correction, the function should now return the expected 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' and pass the failing test.
