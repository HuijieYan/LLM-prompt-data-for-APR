The issue with the `info` function is that it is using the wrong command to get the shell version, and it is not using the `--version` flag. Additionally, the expected version string in the test case is different from the actual version string being returned.

We can fix the function by modifying the Popen call to use the correct command and flag, and also modify the format of the version string to match the expected value.

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version[11:].strip())
```

With these changes, the function should now correctly return the version string in the expected format, and the test case should pass.
