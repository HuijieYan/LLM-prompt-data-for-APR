1. The buggy function is a method of the Fish class, which is not shown in the provided code. It seems to be trying to get the version of the Fish shell using a subprocess and returning it.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of Popen without importing it and other necessary modules like subprocess and typing.

3. The cause of the bug is the missing import statements for the necessary modules, specifically subprocess and typing.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Import necessary modules such as subprocess and typing at the beginning of the code.
- Add a type hint for the info method, indicating that it returns a string.
- Use try-except blocks to handle potential errors when running the subprocess.

5. Corrected code:

```python
from typing import Generic
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL


# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self) -> str:
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
            return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except Exception as e:
            return f'Error getting Fish shell version: {str(e)}'
```
