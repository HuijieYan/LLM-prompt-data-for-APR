1. The buggy function 'info' is part of the 'Fish' class, which is likely a class representing a shell in the 'thefuck' project. The failing test is testing the 'info' function by mocking the 'Popen' class to return a specific value. The error message indicates that the expected output of the 'info' function does not match the actual output. The GitHub issue suggests that the problem lies in the initialization of the Fish Shell with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the command used in the 'Popen' call to retrieve the Fish Shell version. It seems that the command being executed does not produce the expected output.

3. 
   (a). The buggy function 'info' tries to retrieve the Fish Shell version using a subprocess and then formats it into a string. 
   (b). The failing test is mocking the subprocess to return a specific version, and the error message shows that the actual output is not as expected. 
   (c). The GitHub issue indicates that the problem is related to the initialization of the Fish Shell with the Oh-My-Fish plugin, suggesting that the 'info' function may be failing to retrieve the correct version of the shell.

4. Potential approaches for fixing the bug include:
   (a). Modify the command used in the 'Popen' call to ensure it retrieves the correct Fish Shell version.
   (b). Update the 'info' function to handle any specific behavior related to the initialization of the Fish Shell with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

5. Here is the corrected code for the 'info' function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected code uses the command '--version' in the 'Popen' call to retrieve the Fish Shell version. It should pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted in the GitHub thread.
