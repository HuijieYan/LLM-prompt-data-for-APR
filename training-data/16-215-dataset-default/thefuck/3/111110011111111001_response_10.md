Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to be with the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version in the `info` function.

Bug's Cause:
The `info` function is using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to retrieve the version. However, in the failing test, it is expected that the command `fish --version` should be used to get the version, which is causing the discrepancy.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Update the command in the `info` function to use `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`.
2. Modify the function to handle the output of `fish --version` appropriately to extract the version information.

Corrected Code:
```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(',')[1].strip()  # Extract the version from the output
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With the corrected code, the function will use the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version and handle the output to extract the version information, satisfying the failing test and the expected input/output variable information.
