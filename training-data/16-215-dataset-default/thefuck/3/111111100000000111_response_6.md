1. The buggy function "info" is a method of the class "Fish" which is a part of the "thefuck/shells/fish.py" file. The function is intended to return the name and version of the current shell, but it currently uses the Popen function in a way that could cause a recursive loop.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the Popen function call, as it is used to execute the command "fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'" and capture the output.

3. The cause of the bug is that the Popen function call does not take into account the possibility of an infinite loop. It attempts to execute the "fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'" command, but this could potentially lead to a recursive loop when used in the context of TheFuck plugin and Oh-My-Fish.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include modifying the command being executed by Popen, adding error handling to avoid potential infinite loops, or finding an alternative method to retrieve the fish shell version.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except Exception as e:
            print("Error occurred while retrieving Fish shell version:", e)
            return "Fish Shell version not available"
```

This corrected code includes error handling using a try-except block to capture any exceptions that may occur when trying to retrieve the fish shell version. It also uses the "communicate" method of the Popen object to retrieve the output in a safer manner. This code should help resolve the issue posted on GitHub related to the TheFuck plugin and Oh-My-Fish.
