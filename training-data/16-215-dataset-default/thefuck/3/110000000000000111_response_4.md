1. The buggy function is a part of the Fish Shell plugin in Oh-My-Fish, specifically related to TheFuck plugin. The function is meant to return the name and version of the current shell, but it is causing a recursive loop when used with the command "thefuck -v" due to a potential issue in the Popen call.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the Popen call, particularly with the command "fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'".

3. The bug is caused by the Popen call in the function `info`. When the `thefuck -v` command is used, it triggers a recursive loop due to the way the Popen call is executed within the function. This issue is reported in the GitHub issue where it is mentioned that the TheFuck plugin uses `thefuck -v` to decide when to regenerate functions, which triggers the recursive loop.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Adjusting the Popen call to handle the `thefuck -v` command differently.
   - Checking for the specific input command in the function and taking appropriate action to avoid the recursive loop.
   - Refactoring the function to ensure that it only returns the shell name and version without causing conflicts with specific commands like `thefuck -v`.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    shell_info = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $SHELL'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    shell_name = shell_info.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()

    if 'thefuck' in shell_name: # Check for specific command that triggers recursive loop
        return "Fish Shell"  # Handle the special case to avoid the recursive loop
    else:
        version_info = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = version_info.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By checking for the specific command that triggers the recursive loop and handling it separately, the corrected function should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub problem.
