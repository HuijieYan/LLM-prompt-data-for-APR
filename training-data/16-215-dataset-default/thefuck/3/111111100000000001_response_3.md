1. The buggy function is part of the Fish class, and it is used to retrieve the name and version of the current shell. The function uses the Popen method to execute a command and retrieve the shell version.

2. The potential error location is in the proc.stdout.read() method, which may not be reading the output properly.

3. The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of the Popen method and reading the output. The Popen method is used to open a pipe to or from the process, but the correct way to retrieve the output is not being used. This leads to the version variable not being populated correctly.

4. To fix the bug, we need to use the communicate() method to properly retrieve the output of the process. Additionally, we should handle any errors that may occur during the execution of the process.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        out, err = proc.communicate()
        version = out.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
