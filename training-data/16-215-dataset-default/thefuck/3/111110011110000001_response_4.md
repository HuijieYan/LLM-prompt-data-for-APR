Potential Error Location:
The potential error location within the problematic function is the command used to get the version of the Fish shell. The command "echo $FISH_VERSION" is not correctly retrieving the version of the shell.

Bug's Cause:
(a). The buggy function does not correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell.
(b). The Fish class does not have the correct implementation for the info() method to retrieve the version of the shell.
(c). The failing test is expecting the version to be returned in a specific format, and the error message indicates that the returned version is not as expected.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell.
2. Ensure that the info() method in the Fish class returns the version in the expected format.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:
```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    # The corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(" ")[2])
```

By changing the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell to `['fish', '--version']`, the function should now correctly return the version in the expected format. This corrected code should pass the failing test provided.
