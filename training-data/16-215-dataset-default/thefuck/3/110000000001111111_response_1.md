The buggy function `info` is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell using the `Popen` function from the `subprocess` module. The function then attempts to read the output and return the version. The actual input/output variables show that the `Popen` function is not returning the expected value, causing the function to fail.

The GitHub issue titled "thefuck -v hangs Fish Shell initialisation with Oh-My-Fish plugin" describes how the thefuck plugin triggers a recursive loop due to the `Fish.info()` function when using the `-v` flag.

The potential error location appears to be the way the `Popen` function is being used to get the version of the shell. It seems that the command being executed is not returning the correct output, causing the function to fail.

The discrepancies between the expected and actual input/output variables reflect the fact that the version string 'fish, version 3.5.9' is not being correctly accessed from the output of the `Popen` command.

To fix the bug, we should consider using a more reliable method to get the version of the Fish shell, one that does not result in a recursive loop. We can also ensure that the function returns the expected version string.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    version = subprocess.check_output(['fish', '--version']).decode('utf-8').strip()
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected function uses the `subprocess.check_output` function to get the version of the Fish shell directly. It returns the expected version string and should resolve the issue described in the GitHub post.
