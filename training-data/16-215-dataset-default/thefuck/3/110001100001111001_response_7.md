The issue with the buggy function is that it is not correctly capturing the standard output from the Popen process. The `proc.stdout.read()` method is not returning the expected value.

To fix this bug, we can use the `communicate()` method of the `Popen` object to read the standard output and error streams. This will ensure that we capture the correct output from the process.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    stdout, stderr = proc.communicate()
    version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function will capture the output of the `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` command correctly and return the expected version string in the specified format.
