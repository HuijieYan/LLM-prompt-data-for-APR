The potential error in the function is that it is trying to use the `Popen` function without importing it from the `subprocess` module. This is likely causing the function to fail and return incorrect results.

To fix the bug, the `Popen` function needs to be imported from the `subprocess` module and the `DEVNULL` variable should also be imported.

Here is the corrected code for the function:

```python
import subprocess
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell, version {}'.format(version)
```
