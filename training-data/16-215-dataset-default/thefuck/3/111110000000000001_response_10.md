1. The buggy function is a method called "info" within the class "Fish". It is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of the Popen function from the subprocess module. It is used to execute a command in a subshell, and the output is captured to get the version of the Fish shell. 

3. The cause of the bug is likely due to not importing the necessary modules, such as Generic, Popen, PIPE, and DEVNULL. Additionally, the use of the u'' syntax for the string is unnecessary and may be causing issues.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Importing the necessary modules at the beginning of the file, such as from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL.
   - Using the communicate() method of the Popen object to retrieve the output instead of directly reading from stdout.
   - Removing the unnecessary u'' syntax from the return statement.

5. Corrected code:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

# The declaration of the class containing the fixed function
class Fish:

    # the fixed function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        output, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
The above code fixes the bug by importing the necessary modules, using the communicate() method to retrieve the output, and removing the unnecessary u'' syntax.
