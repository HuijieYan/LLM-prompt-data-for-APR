The potential error location within the problematic function is the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version. The command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' is not the correct command to get the version of the Fish shell.

The cause of the bug is that the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' does not return the correct version information of the Fish shell, causing the test to fail. The failing test is specifically checking for the result 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', which is not being obtained due to the incorrect command used to retrieve the version.

To fix the bug, the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version should be used. The correct command is 'fish --version' instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION'.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With the corrected code, the function should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided, and successfully resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
