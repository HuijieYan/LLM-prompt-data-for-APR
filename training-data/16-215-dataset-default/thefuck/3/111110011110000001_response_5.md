The buggy function is a method called `info` within the class `Fish`. It uses the `Popen` function from the `subprocess` module to open a new process and retrieve the version of the fish shell. The failing test function `test_info` is trying to assert that the `info` function returns the correct version of the fish shell, but it fails with an assertion error because the actual output includes the word "fish, version" which is not expected.

The bug is caused by the way the shell version is retrieved from the `Popen` call in the `info` function. The command passed to `Popen` is `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`, which returns the string "fish, version x.x.x". This string is then used to format the output of the `info` function, resulting in the incorrect format.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the command passed to `Popen` to retrieve the version string without the "fish, version" prefix. Then we can format the output of the `info` function correctly to match the expected result from the failing test.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

With this corrected code, the `info` function should now properly retrieve the version of the fish shell without the "fish, version" prefix, and the failing test should pass.
