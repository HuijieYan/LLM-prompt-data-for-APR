The problem in the buggy function lies in the command used to get the shell version. The command being used is 'echo $FISH_VERSION', which is incorrect. The correct command should be 'fish --version' to get the version of the fish shell.

After correcting the command, the updated function should be as follows:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.replace('fish, ', '')  # Remove 'fish, ' from the version string
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now return the correct version of the fish shell and pass the failing test.
