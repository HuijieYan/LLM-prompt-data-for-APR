The potential error in the buggy function is the command used to get the Fish shell version. It currently uses 'echo $FISH_VERSION' but the test is expecting 'fish --version', which causes the assertion error.

The cause of the bug is that the info() function in the Fish class is using the wrong command to retrieve the Fish shell version, leading to a mismatch in the expected and actual shell version in the failing test.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to update the command used to get the Fish shell version in the info() function to match the expected command in the failing test. This will ensure that the function returns the correct shell version and the failing test will pass.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

With this correction, the function should return the correct version of the Fish shell and the failing test should pass. Additionally, this fix will resolve the issue posted on GitHub and prevent the recursive loop triggered by theincorrect command used to retrieve the shell version.
