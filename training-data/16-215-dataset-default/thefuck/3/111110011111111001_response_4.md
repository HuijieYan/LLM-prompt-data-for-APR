The issue is likely with the command being executed in the `info` function, particularly with the argument passed to `Popen` as well as the formatting of the returned value.

The failing test is checking if the output of `shell.info()` is equal to the expected value 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', but the actual output includes additional text 'fish, version', hence the assertion error.

Additionally, the call_args in the failing test suggests that the command passed to `Popen` should be ['fish', '--version'], but the current code is using ['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], which does not match the expected command.

To fix the bug, the `info` function needs to be modified to execute the correct command and format the output accordingly.

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    # the fixed info function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().replace('fish, version ', '')
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
In the fixed version of the `info` function, we corrected the command to ['fish', '--version'] to match the expected command in the failing test. We also updated the `version` variable to remove the extra text 'fish, version ' from the output so that it matches the expected output in the failing test.
