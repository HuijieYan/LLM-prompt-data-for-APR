Potential error location within the problematic function:

The potential error location within the problematic function is the `Popen` call. It seems that the command is not being executed correctly, and therefore the function is not returning the expected value of the Fish shell version.

Bug's cause:

(a). The buggy function:
The function `info` is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell using the `Popen` command to execute the fish shell command `echo $FISH_VERSION`. However, it is not returning the expected value, and the `Popen` call seems to be incomplete.

(b). The buggy class:
The class `Fish` seems to be intended to provide information about the current shell, but the `info` function is not functioning correctly, leading to a recursive loop in some scenarios.

(c). Discrepancies between expected and actual input/output variable value:
The `Popen` call is not returning the correct value for the shell version, which is causing the function to return an unexpected result.

(d). The GitHub Issue information:
The GitHub issue indicates that the problem occurs when using the TheFuck plugin with Oh-My-Fish, which triggers a recursive loop due to the `info` function. The fix is said to be on its way.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:

One possible approach could be to ensure that the `Popen` call is executed correctly, capturing the standard output and handling any errors that may occur. Additionally, the function should return the correct version string for the Fish shell.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    # The corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell, version {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected code should fix the issue and ensure that the `Popen` call is executed correctly, returning the expected version of the Fish shell.
