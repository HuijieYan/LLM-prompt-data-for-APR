1. The buggy function "info" is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running the command "echo $FISH_VERSION" through the Popen function. However, this function is causing an issue with the Oh-My-Fish plugin, specifically with the TheFuck plugin, as it triggers a recursive loop.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of Popen to run the command and retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

3. The cause of the bug is that the TheFuck plugin uses the "thefuck -v" command to decide when to regenerate functions, and this triggers a recursive loop because of the way the shell's version is retrieved in the "info" function. This has been reported as an issue on GitHub and a fix is on the way.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include modifying the way the shell's version is retrieved in the "info" function to avoid triggering a recursive loop when the TheFuck plugin is used. Additionally, it may be necessary to update the TheFuck plugin code to avoid this issue with the Fish shell.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    version = subprocess.check_output(['fish', '--version']).decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected code, the subprocess module is used to directly retrieve the version of the Fish shell without triggering any recursive loops. This should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
