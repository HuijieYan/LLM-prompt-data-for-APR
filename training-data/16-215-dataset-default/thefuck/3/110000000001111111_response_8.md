Analysis:
The buggy function `info` is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell using the `Popen` from the `subprocess` module. However, the function is not returning the expected output.

Potential Error Location:
The potential error location is in the way the command is executed and the output is read from the subprocess.

Bug Cause:
The function is executing the command in the subprocess but is not capturing the complete version information. This is causing a discrepancy in the expected and actual output variable value.

GitHub Issue Information:
The GitHub issue states that the problem is related to the use of the `thefuck -v` command triggering a recursive loop, which is caused by the `Fish.info()` function. The fix for this issue will be related to correcting the behavior of the `Fish.info()` function.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use a different method for capturing the shell version information.
2. Ensure that the command executed in the subprocess captures the complete version information.
3. Implement proper error handling and decoding of the output from the subprocess.

Corrected Code:
```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'fish_print_pwd'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected code uses the command `fish_print_pwd` to capture the complete version information. It also utilizes proper decoding and error handling, which should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
