The problematic function `info` is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell using the `Popen` function. However, it seems to be using the incorrect command to get the version, and it is not formatting the version string correctly.

The actual input/output variable values show that the version is being retrieved as `'3.5.9'`, but the expected output should be `'fish, version 3.5.9'`.

The GitHub issue indicates that the use of `thefuck -v` in the Fish shell is causing a recursive loop due to this function. This suggests that the problem is with the way the version of the shell is being retrieved and used.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to change the command being executed to get the Fish shell version. Additionally, the output format of the version string needs to be corrected to match the expected output.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell, version {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected code, the function `info` should now correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell and format it as expected. This should resolve the issue with the recursive loop caused by the `thefuck -v` command.
