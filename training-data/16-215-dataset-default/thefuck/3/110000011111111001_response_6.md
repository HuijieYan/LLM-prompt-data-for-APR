The issue with the buggy function is that the command being executed to get the FISH_VERSION is incorrect. The command being executed is "echo $FISH_VERSION", which does not return the correct output. Additionally, the test is expecting the version number to be "fish, version 3.5.9" but the actual version is "3.5.9".

To fix the buggy function, the command executed should be 'fish --version' to get the correct version, and the format string should be adjusted to match the format of the actual version number.

```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                            stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function will execute the correct command to get the version and format it correctly. This updated code should pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
