The potential error in the `info` function is in the command used to get the fish shell version. The `Popen` command is using `'echo $FISH_VERSION'` to get the version, but the failing test is expecting the version to be obtained with `'fish', '--version'`.

The buggy function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. The related test function `test_info` is testing the `info` function by mocking the `Popen` command to return the shell version when called. The failing test is expecting the `info` function to return 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' but received 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9' instead.

To fix the bug, we need to update the `proc` command in the `info` function to use `'fish', '--version'` to get the version string.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', ')[1])
```

With this corrected code, the `info` function should now return the expected version string, and the failing test should pass.
