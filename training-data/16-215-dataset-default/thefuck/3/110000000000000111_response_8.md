1. The buggy function is a part of the Fish Shell and is being used by the Oh-My-Fish plugin "TheFuck". The GitHub issue indicates that the usage of the function `thefuck -v` triggers a recursive loop due to the `shells/fish.py:Fish.info()` function.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the command being executed using Popen, which seems to be causing the recursive loop.

3. The bug is caused by the `info` function which is used to retrieve the name and version of the shell. The function executes a command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` using Popen, which is being triggered by the `thefuck -v` command. This creates a recursive loop and hangs the shell, leading to the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.

4. To fix the bug, one possible approach is to modify the way the version of the shell is retrieved. Instead of using the Popen command to execute a shell command within the function, an alternative method could be used to directly access the version information of the shell without triggering a recursive loop.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    version = os.environ.get('FISH_VERSION', 'unknown')
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By directly accessing the environment variable `FISH_VERSION`, we can avoid the use of the Popen command and resolve the recursive loop issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
