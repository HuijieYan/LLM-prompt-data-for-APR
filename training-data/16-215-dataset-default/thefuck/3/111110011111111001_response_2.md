The root cause of the bug is that the command being executed by Popen is 'echo $FISH_VERSION' instead of 'fish --version', resulting in an incorrect version string. Additionally, the expected version format is also different from the actual format.

To fix the bug, the command passed to Popen needs to be changed to 'fish --version' to get the correct version of the fish shell. Also, the format of the version string needs to be updated to match the expected output.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    # The corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.replace('fish, version ', ''))
```

With the above corrected code, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
