The problem with the `info` function is that it is using the wrong command to get the version of the Fish shell. The `Popen` command should be executing `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`. 

Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[2]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This code will execute `fish --version` and extract the version from the output, satisfying the expected input/output values provided.
