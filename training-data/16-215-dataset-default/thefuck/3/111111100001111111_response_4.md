The bug in the provided function is that it is not returning the expected value. The function is supposed to return the version of the Fish shell, but it is currently returning it in the wrong format. This is causing the tests to fail.

The cause of the bug is that the return statement in the `info` function is not formatting the version string correctly. It is missing the word "version" before the actual version number.

To fix the bug, we need to update the return statement to format the version string correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell, version {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected code should satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.

Additionally, the corrected function should successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub issue titled "thefuck -v hangs Fish Shell initialisation with Oh-My-Fish plugin".
