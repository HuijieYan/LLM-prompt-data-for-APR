1. The buggy function "info" in the "Fish" class is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. The function uses Popen to execute a command and retrieve the version of the Fish shell. However, the use of Popen and reading the output can result in a hang, causing a recursive loop when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

2. The potential error location is the usage of Popen to execute the 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION' command, as well as reading the output directly without handling potential issues.

3. The cause of the bug is the implementation of the info function, which does not handle potential errors or issues that may arise when executing the command using Popen. This leads to a hang and recursive loop when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin. The GitHub issue further confirms that the hang is triggered by using the "thefuck -v" command, causing issues with the shell initialization.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include using a different method to retrieve the Fish shell version, handling errors and potential hangs, and ensuring that the function does not cause recursive loops. Additionally, proper handling of the command execution and output reading is necessary.

5. Here's the corrected code for the "info" function:

```python
import subprocess

class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            version = subprocess.check_output(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']).decode('utf-8').strip()
            return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
            return 'Fish Shell: Error retrieving version'
```

In the corrected code, the subprocess module is used to execute the command and retrieve the version of the Fish shell. The try-except block is used to handle any potential errors that may occur during the command execution. If an error occurs, the function returns an error message instead of hanging or causing a recursive loop. This should resolve the GitHub issue and prevent the shell initialization problem with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.
