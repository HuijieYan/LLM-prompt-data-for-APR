Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to be with the command used to retrieve the Fish Shell version. The function is using 'fish -c' to run the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION', but it is not capturing the full version string correctly.

Bug's Cause:
The problem is that the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' is only returning the version number, without the text 'Fish Shell'. This discrepancy is causing the function to return an incorrect string representation of the version.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the command to include the text 'Fish Shell' in the version string.
2. Ensure that the version string is captured correctly from the stdout of the Popen process.

Corrected Code:
```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo "Fish Shell $FISH_VERSION"'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return version
```

This corrected function will return the version string in the expected format, and should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
