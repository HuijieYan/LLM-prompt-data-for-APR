Potential Error Location:
The issue seems to be occurring because the call to Popen is not correctly capturing the output of the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' in the fish shell. This is causing the function to return an incorrect version string.

Bug's Cause:
The Popen call is not handling the command output correctly, which is causing the function to return an incorrect version of the shell.

Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the Popen call to correctly capture the output of the 'echo $FISH_VERSION' command.
2. Update the function to handle the version string correctly before returning it.

Corrected Code:
```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
This corrected code uses subprocess.Popen to capture the output of the 'echo $FISH_VERSION' command and then retrieves the output using communicate(). This should resolve the issue and provide the correct version of the fish shell.
