1. The buggy function is part of a class called `Fish`. The function `info` is supposed to return the version of the Fish shell. The failing test is checking if the output of the `info` function matches a specific version. The error message indicates that the returned result includes extra characters, causing the assertion to fail.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the way the version is being extracted by using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` and then reading the output. This approach might be problematic and causing the extra characters in the result.

3. The potential cause of the bug is:
   (a). The problematic function is not correctly extracting the version of the Fish shell.
   (b). The class `Fish` has the `info` function that is not returning the expected version.
   (c). The failing test is checking for the specific version and failing due to extra characters in the returned result.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Change the command used to extract the Fish shell version.
   (b). Modify the `info` function to properly format the returned version.
   (c). Update the failing test to reflect the changes made to the `info` function.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL  # Import necessary modules

class Fish(Generic):  # The declaration of the class containing the buggy function

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],  # Use the correct command to get the version
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1]  # Extract the version correctly
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.strip())  # Return the version in the correct format
```

With the corrected code, the `info` function should now properly extract and format the Fish shell version. This should allow it to pass the failing test.
