Potential Error Location:
The potential error in the function lies in the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version. The Popen command is using the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' to get the version, but in the failing test the expected output is 'fish, version 3.5.9' which is not matching the output from the Popen command.

Bug's Cause:
(a). The buggy function 'info' in the 'Fish' class is using the Popen command to execute a shell command and retrieve the Fish shell version. However, the command used inside Popen is not providing the expected output.
(b). The failing test is expecting the output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' but the buggy function is returning 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'.
(c). The error message indicates the assertion error where the expected output does not match the actual output.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the command inside the Popen to use 'fish --version' to retrieve the version in the 'info' function of the 'Fish' class.
2. Update the failing test to reflect the change in the expected output based on the modified Popen command.

Corrected Code for the Problematic Function:
```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    # this is the buggy function you need to fix
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(' ')[2])  # Extracting the version from 'fish, version x.x.x'
```

The failing test function for the corrected code should remain the same as the expected output in the test is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'.
