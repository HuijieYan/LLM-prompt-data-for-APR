1. The buggy function 'info' seems to be attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by running a command and capturing the output. The failing test is attempting to mock the behavior of the Popen object and test the 'info' function. The error message indicates that the expected output of the 'info' function does not match the actual output, hinting at a potential issue with the command execution in the 'info' function. The GitHub issue suggests that there is a recursive loop triggered by the 'info' function when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

2. The potential error location within the 'info' function is the command being executed using Popen and the processing of its output.

3. (a) The 'info' function uses Popen to execute the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' and capture the output.
   (b) The failing test exits with an AssertionError because the expected output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' does not match the actual output.
   (c) The GitHub issue indicates that the 'info' function triggers a recursive loop when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin, suggesting that the function's behavior is not as expected.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the command being executed in the 'info' function to retrieve the Fish shell version in a more reliable manner.
   - Correctly process the output of the command to ensure the version is extracted and formatted correctly.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    fish_version = version.split()[-1]  # Extract the version from the output
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(fish_version)
```

This corrected code uses Popen to execute the command 'fish --version' and captures the output. It then extracts the version from the output and formats it as 'Fish Shell x.x.x'. This should satisfy the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug.
