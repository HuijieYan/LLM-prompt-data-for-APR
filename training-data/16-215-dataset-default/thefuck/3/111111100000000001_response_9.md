Here's the corrected code:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL, shell=True)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of `proc.stdout.read()` without waiting for the process to finish. This can cause the function to return empty or incomplete data.

The cause of the bug is the incorrect handling of the subprocess created by `Popen`. The function does not wait for the process to finish and read its output properly.

To fix the bug, we need to use the `communicate()` method of the subprocess to wait for the process to finish and read its output.

The corrected code uses the `communicate()` method to properly read the output of the subprocess and wait for it to finish before returning the version of the Fish shell. Additionally, we added `shell=True` to the `Popen` call to enable the use of shell syntax in the command.

This should resolve the issue with the original buggy function.
