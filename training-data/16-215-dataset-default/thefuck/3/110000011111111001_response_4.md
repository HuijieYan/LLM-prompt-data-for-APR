The problematic function is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by executing the command "echo $FISH_VERSION". However, the test is expecting the output to be "fish, version 3.5.9" instead of just "3.5.9". This indicates that the command being executed is incorrect.

The cause of the bug is that the function is executing the wrong command to get the Fish shell version. It should be executing "fish --version" instead of "echo $FISH_VERSION".

To fix the bug, we need to update the command being executed by the Popen function to "fish --version". This will provide the expected output for the test.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now return the expected version string "fish, version 3.5.9", which will make the test pass.
