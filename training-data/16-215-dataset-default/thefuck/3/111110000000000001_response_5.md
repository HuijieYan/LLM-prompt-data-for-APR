1. The problem lies within the info function of the Fish class, which is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell using a subprocess call. The issue is likely related to the use of Popen and the handling of the output data.

2. The potential error location is the line where the Popen function is called to run the 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION' command, and then trying to read the output.

3. (a) The buggy function is attempting to run a subprocess to get the version of the Fish shell and then format it into a string.
   (b) The buggy class is a generic class that does not provide any specific information about the Fish shell or its version.

4. The possible approaches for fixing the bug could be:
   - Using a more reliable method to retrieve the Fish shell version, such as using the platform module to get the version information directly from the system.
   - Using the subprocess module to run the command and capture its output more effectively.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
import platform
import subprocess

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        version = platform.python_version()
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

In this corrected code, we use the platform module to directly retrieve the version of the Fish shell and return it in the desired format. This eliminates the need for subprocess calls and potential issues with reading the output.
