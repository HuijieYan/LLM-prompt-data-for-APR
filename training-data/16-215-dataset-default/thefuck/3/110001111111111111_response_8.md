The problem lies in the command used to get the Fish version. The command `echo $FISH_VERSION` will not give the correct version information, instead 'fish --version' should be used. This is evident from the failing test function's error message which shows the expected Fish version string as 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' while the actual string is 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the command used to retrieve the Fish version.

To fix the bug, the command to get the Fish version should be changed from `echo $FISH_VERSION` to `fish --version`.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().replace('fish, version ', '')
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided, and successfully resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
