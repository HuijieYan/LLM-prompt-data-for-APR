Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version in the info function.

Bug cause: The bug causes the info function to retrieve the version of Fish shell incorrectly, leading to the failing test and the associated GitHub issue.

The failing test asserts that the info() method of the Fish class should return 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', but it actually returns 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9', causing the assertion to fail.

The GitHub issue suggests that the problem may be related to a recursive loop triggered by the use of the 'thefuck -v' command in the Fish shell.

Possible fixes:
1. Update the command used in the info function to correctly retrieve the Fish shell version.
2. Add error handling to handle any potential issues with retrieving the version of the shell.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(' ')[2]
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected code, the info function now uses the command 'fish --version' to retrieve the Fish shell version and properly formats the output to match the expected result in the failing test. This should resolve the issue reported in the GitHub bug report.
