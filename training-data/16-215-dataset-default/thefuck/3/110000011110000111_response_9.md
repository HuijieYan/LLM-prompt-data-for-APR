1. The buggy function, 'info', is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. The failing test 'test_info' is testing this function, and it's failing with an assertion error. The error message shows that it's expecting the output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' but getting 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'. The GitHub issue also mentions that there is a problem with the initialization of the Fish Shell when using the oh-my-fish plugin.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the way it retrieves the version of the Fish Shell using the Popen command.

3. 
   (a). The buggy function uses Popen to execute a command and retrieve the version of the shell. However, it seems to be retrieving additional information along with the version, causing the version string to include unwanted text.
   (b). The failing test is expecting the version string 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' but receiving 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9', leading to the assertion error.
   (c). The GitHub issue mentions that the problem is related to a recursive loop triggered by the use of the 'thefuck -v' command with the oh-my-fish plugin.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the Popen command to only retrieve the version information without any additional text.
   - Handle the version string to extract only the version number and format it as 'Fish Shell x.x.x'.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(', ')[1]  # Extract version number from the returned string
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'  # Format the version string

```

With the corrected code, the function should now pass the failing test and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
