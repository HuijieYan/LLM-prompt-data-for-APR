1. The buggy function `info` is responsible for returning the name and version of the current shell, in this case, Fish Shell.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the command being used to retrieve the version of the Fish Shell.

3. The buggy function uses the `Popen` function incorrectly to fetch the version of the shell, and this is reflected in the failing test and error message. The failing test sets up a mock response for `Popen.return_value.stdout.read.side_effect`, but the function is not structured to handle this correctly. The error message indicates that the expected output does not match the actual output.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Ensuring that the `Popen` function is used correctly to retrieve the version of the Fish Shell.
   - Adjusting the function to handle the mock response set up in the failing test.

5. Here's the corrected code for the problematic function incorporating the fixes:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

With this corrected function, it should pass the failing test as the `Popen` function is now used correctly to retrieve the version of the Fish Shell and handle the mock response set up in the failing test.
