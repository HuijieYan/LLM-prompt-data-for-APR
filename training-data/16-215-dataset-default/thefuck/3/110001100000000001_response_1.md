1. The buggy function is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell using the `Popen` function from the `subprocess` module. It then reads the output and formats it to return as the name and version of the shell.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8')`, which may not handle the output properly, leading to the bug.

3. The bug is caused by the use of `proc.stdout.read()` without waiting for the process to finish, or checking for errors. This can lead to incomplete or incorrect output being read.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Use `proc.communicate()` instead of `proc.stdout.read()` to wait for the process to finish and get the output.
   - Check for errors and handle them appropriately.
   - Use a try-except block to catch any exceptions that may occur.

5. Corrected code:

```python
# The corrected version of the function
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
