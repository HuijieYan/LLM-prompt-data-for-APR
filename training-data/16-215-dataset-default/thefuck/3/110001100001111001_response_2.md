The problem with the current implementation is that the `Popen` method is not being called correctly, and the format of the version string is also incorrect. It looks like the expected version string should be in the format 'fish, version x.x.x'.

To fix the bug, we need to properly execute the command to get the Fish shell version and format the version string accordingly.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL, text=True)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].strip()
    return u'fish, version {}'.format(version)
```

This code uses the `communicate` method to properly execute the command and capture the output. It also formats the version string as expected.

With this corrected code, the function should now satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
