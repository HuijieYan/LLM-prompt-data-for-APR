1. The buggy function is inside the Fish class, and it is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell.

2. The potential error location is the line where the Popen object is created, as it may not handle the 'fish' command properly.

3. The cause of the bug is that the Popen object is not handling the 'fish' command properly, leading to incorrect output.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could be to use subprocess.run instead of Popen, handle any errors that may occur during the command execution, and ensure that the command is executed properly.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import subprocess

class Fish:
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            result = subprocess.run(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL, check=True, text=True)
            version = result.stdout.strip()
            return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except subprocess.CalledProcessError:
            return 'Unable to retrieve Fish Shell version'
```
