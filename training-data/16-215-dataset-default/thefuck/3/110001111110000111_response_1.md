Analysis:
The buggy function 'info' in fish.py is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command and capturing its output. The failing test is trying to assert that the function returns the correct shell version, but it fails due to the mismatch in the expected and actual output. The GitHub issue also indicates that this function is causing a recursive loop when used with Oh-My-Fish's TheFuck plugin, suggesting that the function is not correctly retrieving the shell version.

Potential Error Location:
The potential error lies in the command being executed to retrieve the shell version and the way the output is being processed in the 'info' function.

Bug's Cause:
(a). The 'info' function in fish.py uses the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' to retrieve the shell version, but the actual version is not being captured correctly.
(b). The failing test is expecting 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' as the output, but the actual output includes extra information and does not match the expected output.
(c). The GitHub issue suggests that the function triggers a recursive loop when used with a specific plugin, indicating an issue with the function's behavior.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Modify the command used in the 'info' function to accurately retrieve the Fish shell version.
2. Process the output of the command to extract the version information correctly.
3. Ensure that the function does not cause recursive loops and works as expected with plugins.

Corrected Code:
```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

# corrected version of the info function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

By using the command 'fish --version' and modifying the processing of the output to extract the version information correctly, the corrected 'info' function now accurately retrieves the Fish shell version. This corrected code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
