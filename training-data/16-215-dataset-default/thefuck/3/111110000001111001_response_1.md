The problem with the `info` function is that it is not importing the necessary modules and objects. It is missing the `from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL` line at the beginning of the file. Additionally, the `Generic` class is not imported as well.

To fix the bug, we need to import the required modules and objects and remove the existing imports. We also need to fix the command being executed to get the Fish shell version.

Here is the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-v'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL, text=True)
        version = proc.stdout.read().strip()
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

With these changes, the `info` function should now return the correct version of the Fish shell.
