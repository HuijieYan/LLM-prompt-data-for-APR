1. The buggy function is a method 'info' inside the 'Fish' class. It uses the 'Popen' class to execute a command and retrieve the version of the Fish shell. The failing test 'test_info' is calling the 'info' method and checking if the returned shell version matches the expected version. The error message shows that the actual shell version returned is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'` instead of the expected version `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`. The GitHub issue suggests that the problem is related to the use of the 'thefuck' plugin with Oh-My-Fish.

2. The potential error location is the command being executed using 'Popen' to get the Fish shell version.

3. 
   (a). The buggy function is trying to get the version of the Fish shell by executing the command 'fish -c "echo $FISH_VERSION"'. However, it seems to be returning an unexpected string format.
   (b). The 'Fish' class is not importing the necessary modules for 'Popen' and 'PIPE'.
   (c). The failing test is checking the returned version of the Fish shell and confirming if it matches the expected version. The error message shows that the actual version is not matching the expected version.
   (d). The discrepancies between the expected and actual input/output variable values are in the format of the returned Fish shell version.
   (e). The GitHub issue has identified that the problem is related to the usage of the 'thefuck' plugin with Oh-My-Fish and a fix is on the way.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the command executed by 'Popen' to retrieve the Fish shell version in a format that matches the expected value.
   - Ensure that the 'Popen' class and 'PIPE' are properly imported in the 'Fish' class.
   - Investigate how the 'thefuck' plugin could be causing the recursive loop and address that issue as well.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function 'info':

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split(', ')[1]  # Extracting only the version number
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
