The issue with the buggy function is that it is not correctly capturing the output of the 'echo $FISH_VERSION' command in the fish shell.

The 'Popen' function is used to create a new process, and in this case, it is executing the 'fish -c' command to run the 'echo $FISH_VERSION' command. However, the way the stdout is being read and the version is being extracted is incorrect.

To fix this, we need to properly capture the output of the 'echo $FISH_VERSION' command and then format it correctly.

Here is the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE)
    version, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = version.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return 'fish, version {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now return the expected value and type of variables for the failing test cases.
