1. The buggy function `info` within the `Fish` class in the `fish.py` file is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell. The `Popen` function is used to run the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`, but there are issues with how the output is being handled.

The GitHub issue titled `thefuck -v hangs Fish Shell initialisation with Oh-My-Fish plugin` indicates that the thefuck plugin is causing a recursive loop due to the usage of `thefuck -v` triggering the `Fish.info()` function.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the handling of the process output and the potential for causing a hang due to a recursive loop.

3. The cause of the bug is likely due to the way the function is handling the process output and how it interacts with the thefuck plugin. It seems like the `info` function is being called in a way that triggers a recursive loop, leading to a hang.

4. To fix the bug, one possible approach is to modify the way the process output is handled within the `info` function. Additionally, the interaction with the thefuck plugin needs to be considered to avoid triggering a recursive loop.

5. Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
# The corrected code for the buggy function

from subprocess import run, PIPE

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = run(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], capture_output=True, text=True)
        version = proc.stdout.strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By using `subprocess.run` with `capture_output=True` and `text=True` parameters, we can retrieve the output of the command and strip any extra whitespace. This should prevent the hang caused by the previous implementation.
