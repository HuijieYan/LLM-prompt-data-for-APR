The issue is that the command being run by Popen is 'echo $FISH_VERSION' which is not the correct command to get the fish version. The correct command should be 'fish --version'.

To fix the bug, update the command passed to Popen to 'fish --version' to correctly get the version of the fish shell.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```
