1. The `info` function is designed to return the name and version of the current shell. It is being tested with the `test_info` function, which sets up a mock `Popen` object with a side_effect to simulate the output of the `fish --version` command. The error message indicates that the expected output of the `info` function is not matching with the actual output.

2. The potential error location within the `info` function is the command being used to retrieve the version of the shell, and the formatting of the output.

3. The cause of the bug is that the `info` function is using the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` to retrieve the version, but the test is setting up the mock `Popen` object to simulate the output of `fish --version`. This discrepancy in the command being used to retrieve the version is causing the mismatch in the expected and actual outputs.

4. To fix the bug, the `info` function should be updated to use the `fish --version` command to retrieve the version information. Additionally, the formatting of the output should be adjusted to ensure it matches the expected format in the test.

5. Here is the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.replace('fish, version ', ''))
```

With the corrected code, the `info` function now uses the `fish --version` command to retrieve the version information. It also adjusts the formatting of the output to match the expected format in the test. This change should ensure that the function passes the failing test.
