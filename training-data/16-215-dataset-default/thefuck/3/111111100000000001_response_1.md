Potential error location: The problem lies in the `info` function, specifically with the usage of `Popen` and `stdout.read()`.

Bug's cause:
(a) The `Popen` function is not being closed after executing, potentially causing resource leaks.
(b) The `stdout.read()` method is not being used properly and may result in inconsistent behavior.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use `proc.communicate()` to properly close the `Popen` process and retrieve the output.
2. Use a try-except block to handle potential errors.

Corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    # The corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        version = ''
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        except Exception as e:
            print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
