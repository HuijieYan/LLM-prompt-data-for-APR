The issue in the 'info' function is that it is using the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' to get the Fish shell version, but the test is expecting the command 'fish --version' to be executed.

To fix this, we need to update the command being executed to 'fish --version' in the 'info' function.

Here is the corrected code for the 'info' function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the 'info' function will now execute the correct command to get the Fish shell version, and it will return the expected value 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' when the failing test is executed.
