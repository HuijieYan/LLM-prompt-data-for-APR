1. The buggy function attempts to get the version of the fish shell using subprocess.Popen, but there are several issues in the code that need to be addressed.

2. The potential error location is in the Popen call, where the command to be executed is 'echo $FISH_VERSION'. The function also does not properly handle the subprocess.Popen output.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function does not properly capture the output of the shell command and also does not handle any potential errors that may occur.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Capture the output of the shell command properly using communicate() method of the Popen object.
   - Add error handling to account for any potential issues when executing the shell command.

5. Corrected code:
```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
        output, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        print(f"Error occurred: {e}")
        return None
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")
        return None
```
In the corrected code, we use the communicate() method to capture the output of the shell command and handle potential errors that may occur during the execution of the command. We also import the subprocess module and use it directly instead of referring to Popen and PIPE from subprocess.
