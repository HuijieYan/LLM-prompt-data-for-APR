Potential error location: The error is likely occurring when trying to parse the version number from the output of the 'fish --version' command.

Bug cause: The bug is likely caused by the incorrect parsing of the version number from the output of the 'fish --version' command in the info function. The expected format for the version number is not being extracted correctly.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Use the correct command and parsing method to extract the version number from the output of the 'fish --version' command.
2. Ensure that the extracted version number is in the correct format expected by the failing test.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The corrected code for the info function
def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        shell_version = subprocess.check_output(['fish', '--version']).decode('utf-8').strip().replace('fish, version ', '')
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(shell_version)
```

Corrected code for the test function:

```python
# The corrected test function for the info method
def test_info(self, shell, Popen):
        shell_version = b'fish, version 3.5.9\n'
        Popen.return_value.stdout.read.side_effect = [shell_version]
        assert shell.info() == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'
        assert Popen.call_args[0][0] == ['fish', '--version']
```
