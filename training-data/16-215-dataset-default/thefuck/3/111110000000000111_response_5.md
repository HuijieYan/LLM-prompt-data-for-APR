1. The buggy function is a part of the Fish class. The function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, but it is currently using the Popen method in a way that causes the shell to hang, creating a recursive loop. The GitHub issue indicates that this problem is causing issues with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

2. The potential error in the function lies in the Popen method, where it is trying to execute the command 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION' and capture the output. This seems to be causing the recursive loop and hanging the shell.

3. The cause of the bug is the usage of the Popen method. The function 'info' in the Fish class is trying to execute a command that causes a recursive loop, leading to the hanging of the shell. This is causing issues with the Oh-My-Fish plugin, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   a. Using a different method to capture the shell version without causing a recursive loop.
   b. Checking for the presence of the Oh-My-Fish plugin and handling the behavior of the 'info' function accordingly.
   c. Ensuring that the function does not cause a hang or a recursive loop in the shell when it is executed.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import subprocess

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.PIPE)
            version, _ = proc.communicate()
            version = version.decode('utf-8').strip()
            return f'Fish Shell {version}'
        except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
            return 'Error getting shell version: ' + str(e)
```

This corrected function uses the `subprocess.Popen` method to execute the command 'fish --version' and capture the output without causing a recursive loop or hanging the shell. It also handles any potential errors that may occur during the process. This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
