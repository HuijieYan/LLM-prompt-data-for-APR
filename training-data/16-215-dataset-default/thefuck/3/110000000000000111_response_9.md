1. The buggy function is a part of the Fish shell and is responsible for returning the name and version of the current shell. The GitHub issue is related to the Oh-My-Fish plugin using the command 'thefuck -v' which triggers a recursive loop due to the shell's info() function.

2. The potential error in the problematic function lies in the command 'thefuck -v' triggering a recursive loop due to the way the function retrieves the shell version.

3. (a) The problematic function 'info' attempts to retrieve the version of the Fish shell using the command 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION' but the way it does so causes issues when called by the Oh-My-Fish plugin.
   (b) The GitHub issue clearly states that the 'thefuck -v' command triggers a recursive loop due to the function info().

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug may include:
   - Changing the way the function retrieves the version of the shell
   - Adding a check to prevent the recursive loop from occurring
   - Modifying the function to work without issues when called by the Oh-My-Fish plugin

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    # Add a check to prevent recursive loop
    if 'thefuck -v' in ' '.join(sys.argv):
        return "Not available"
    else:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
