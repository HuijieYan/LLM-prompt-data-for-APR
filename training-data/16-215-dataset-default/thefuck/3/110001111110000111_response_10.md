1. The buggy function is 'info' in the file fish.py. The function uses Popen to run the command 'fish -c "echo $FISH_VERSION"', and then extracts the version from the output. The failing test is in test_fish.py, and it is checking if the info function returns the correct version. The error message indicates that the function is returning the version along with additional text, leading to the assertion error. The GitHub issue suggests that the recursive loop is triggered by the info function.

2. The potential error location within the 'info' function is the return statement. The function is not correctly parsing the version from the output of the 'fish -c "echo $FISH_VERSION"' command.

3. The cause of the bug is that the 'info' function is returning the version along with additional text, causing the assertion error in the failing test. The GitHub issue indicates that the info function triggers a recursive loop.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Modify the Popen command to execute 'fish --version' instead of 'fish -c "echo $FISH_VERSION"' to directly retrieve the version.
   - Update the parsing of the version from the output to ensure only the version is returned without any additional text.

5. Corrected code for the 'info' function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    output = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = output.split(' ')[2]  # Extracting just the version
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
This corrected code modifies the Popen command to run 'fish --version' and updates the parsing of the version from the output. It should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
