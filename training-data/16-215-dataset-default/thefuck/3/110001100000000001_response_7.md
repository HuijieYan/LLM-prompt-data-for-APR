1. The buggy function is a method in the fish.py file of the thefuck package. It is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell by executing a command and capturing the output. However, the use of Popen and stdout.read() is not handled properly, leading to potential issues in capturing the output.

2. The potential error location is the usage of Popen and stdout.read(). There may be issues with how the command output is being captured and decoded.

3. The cause of the bug is likely due to the incorrect handling of the subprocess output. The Popen call to execute the 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION' command is not being properly captured and decoded, leading to potential errors in retrieving the version information.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Use the subprocess.check_output() function to capture the output of the command directly.
   b. Properly handle any potential errors or exceptions that may arise during the subprocess call.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    version = subprocess.check_output(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']).decode('utf-8').strip()
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected code, the subprocess.check_output() function is used to directly capture the output of the command. The output is then decoded and stripped to retrieve the version information. This approach avoids potential issues with capturing the subprocess output and provides a more reliable way to retrieve the version of the Fish shell.
