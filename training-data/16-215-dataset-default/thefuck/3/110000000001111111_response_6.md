The buggy function "info" is trying to retrieve the version of the Fish shell, but it is not working as intended. The function makes use of the Popen class to run a command to retrieve the shell version, but the way it is being used seems to be causing the issue.

The likely cause of the problem is that the Popen call is not being handled correctly, resulting in the function returning an incorrect version of the shell. This is evident from the expected and actual values of the variables, where the version is expected to be 'fish, version 3.5.9' but is actually '3.5.9'.

To fix the bug, the Popen call should be properly handled to ensure that the shell version is correctly retrieved. Additionally, the function should return the version in the expected format.

One possible approach to fixing the bug is to use the communicate() method of the proc object to retrieve the output of the command. Additionally, the command being run should be modified to include the 'fish -v' option to get the shell version in the desired format.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-v'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now return the expected shell version and format, resolving the issue posted on GitHub.
