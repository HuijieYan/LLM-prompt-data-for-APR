The potential error location within the problematic function is likely in the command used to get the Fish shell version. It seems that the command being used is not retrieving the version in the correct format, which is causing the assertion error in the test.

The cause of the bug is that the command to retrieve the Fish shell version in the `info` function is not returning the version in the expected format, causing the assertion error in the test.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the command used to retrieve the Fish shell version so that it returns the version in the correct format.

Here is the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(', ')[1]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this modification, the `info` function should now correctly retrieve the version of the Fish shell in the expected format, and the failing test should pass.
