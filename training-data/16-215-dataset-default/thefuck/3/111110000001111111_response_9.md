Potential error location within the problematic function:
The issue seems to be with the command being passed to Popen. The command ['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'] is attempting to execute a command inside the fish shell to retrieve the shell version, but it is not providing the desired output.

Bug's cause:
The bug seems to be caused by the incomplete or incorrect command being passed to Popen. This could be due to the way the shell version is retrieved in the Fish shell, which is not being handled correctly. The discrepancy between the expected and actual input/output variable values also suggests that the command is not functioning as intended.

GitHub Issue information:
The GitHub issue suggests that when Oh-My-Fish's TheFuck plugin uses the command thefuck -v, it triggers a recursive loop, which is caused by the problematic function Fish.info().

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Replace the command ['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'] with a different command that retrieves the fish shell version accurately.
2. Handle the command execution in a manner that prevents triggering a recursive loop, as mentioned in the GitHub issue.
3. Ensure that the function provides the correct output format for the shell version to match the expected value.

Corrected code for the problematic function, satisfying the expected input/output variable information and resolving the GitHub issue:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, STDOUT

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=STDOUT)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell, version {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected code, the Popen command is changed to retrieve the shell version using ['fish', '--version'] instead of attempting to use the echo command within the shell. Additionally, the stderr parameter is set to STDOUT to handle any error output. This code satisfies the expected input/output variable information and should resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
