The issue with the function is that it is using the wrong command to get the version of the fish shell. Instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION', it should be using '--version' to get the correct version. This is causing the discrepancy in the expected and actual values.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the `proc` assignment to use the correct command to get the version. We also need to update the expected value of the `version` variable to match the correct version string.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now return the correct version of the fish shell and pass the failing test.
