1. The buggy function is the "info" function within the "Fish" class. This function is responsible for returning the name and version of the current shell. The issue on GitHub indicates that the function is causing a recursive loop when the thefuck -v command is used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the Popen command, which executes the 'fish' command and retrieves the version using the environment variable $FISH_VERSION.

3. The bug is caused by the function info() in the Fish class, which is using the Popen command to execute the 'fish' command and retrieve the version, causing a recursive loop when the thefuck -v command is used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin. The GitHub issue information confirms that this is the cause of the bug.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include modifying the way the version of the Fish shell is retrieved in the info() function to prevent the recursive loop. This might involve using a different method to retrieve the version or adding a condition to check if the function is being called in a recursive context.

5. Here is the corrected code for the problematic function "info" within the "Fish" class:

```python
from subprocess import run, PIPE

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = run(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, text=True)
        version = proc.stdout.strip()
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The modified code now uses the `run` function instead of `Popen` to execute the 'fish --version' command and retrieve the version of the shell. This should prevent the recursive loop issue when using the thefuck -v command with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.
