The potential error location within the problematic function is the command being used in the Popen function. The command is using 'echo $FISH_VERSION' but the test is expecting the version to be retrieved using 'fish --version'.

The bug's cause is a discrepancy between the command used to retrieve the version of Fish Shell in the info function and the command that the test is expecting.

To fix the bug, the command used in the Popen function should be changed to 'fish --version' to match the test expectations.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The corrected code should now pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and successfully resolve the issue posted in the GitHub repository.
