1. The buggy function is 'info' which is intended to return the name and version of the current shell. The failing test is testing the 'info' function with a mocked Popen object. The error message indicates an AssertionError, showing that the expected output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' does not match the actual output 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'. The GitHub issue suggests that the problematic function is causing a recursive loop and provides a reference for the fix.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' being used to get the Fish shell version.

3. (a). The buggy function is attempting to get the version of the Fish shell using the Popen module, but the command used to retrieve the version is not providing the expected output.
   (b). The failing test is expecting the output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', but the actual output is 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9', causing an AssertionError.
   (c). The GitHub issue suggests that the function is causing a recursive loop, potentially due to the way it's getting the shell version.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Change the command used in Popen to retrieve the Fish shell version.
   - Modify the 'info' function to handle the version output properly.

5. Corrected code for the 'info' function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', ')[1])
```

With this corrected code, the function should properly retrieve the Fish shell version using the correct command, and the 'info' function should pass the failing test. Additionally, this fix should resolve the issue posted on GitHub related to the recursive loop caused by the original function.
