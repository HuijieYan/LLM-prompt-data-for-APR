The issue in the buggy function lies in the command being executed by Popen. The command is set to check for the version of Fish shell using 'echo $FISH_VERSION', but the test is expecting the command to be 'fish --version'.

The failing test is expecting the output string 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' but is receiving 'fish, version 3.5.9'. This discrepancy is the cause of the assertion error.

To fix this bug, the command executed by Popen should be changed to 'fish --version' to match the expectation of the failing test.

The corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(",")[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected code will pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided. Additionally, it will resolve the issue posted in GitHub related to the oh-my-fish/plugin-thefuck#11 bug.
