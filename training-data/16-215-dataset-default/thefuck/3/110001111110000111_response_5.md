Potential error location within the problematic function:
The potential error is likely in the Popen command where the command used is 'echo $FISH_VERSION' instead of '--version', causing the version to be incorrectly retrieved.

Bug's cause:
The bug is caused by the incorrect command used in the Popen call to retrieve the Fish shell version. As a result, the retrieved version is not as expected, causing the failing test and the GitHub issue.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Change the command in the Popen call to '--version' instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION' to correctly retrieve the Fish shell version.
2. Update the test case to mock the correct output for the modified Popen call.

The corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The corrected function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', version ')[1])
```

With the above correction, the function will now retrieve the correct version of the Fish shell using the '--version' command. This change will address the failing test case and resolve the issue posted on GitHub.
