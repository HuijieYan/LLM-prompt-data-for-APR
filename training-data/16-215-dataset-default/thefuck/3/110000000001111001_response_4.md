The issue with the buggy function is that it is not actually executing the command to get the fish shell version. Instead, it is using a MagicMock object, which is likely due to the function being tested with a testing framework such as pytest.

To fix this, we need to modify the function to actually execute the command to get the fish shell version. Here's the corrected code:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return 'Fish Shell, version {}'.format(version)
```

By using the `subprocess` module's `Popen` function, we can actually execute the command to get the fish shell version and retrieve the output. This should fix the issue and the function should now return the correct version of the fish shell.
