1. The buggy function is part of the Fish class, which does not seem to be properly defined in the provided code snippet. The failing test is trying to test the info() method of the Fish class, but it is failing with an AssertionError. The GitHub issue describes a problem with the TheFuck plugin triggering a recursive loop in the Fish.info() method.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the command being executed in the info() method using Popen.

3. (a). The buggy function: The info() method is supposed to return the name and version of the Fish Shell.
   (b). The buggy class: The Fish class seems to be incomplete and lacks proper definition in the provided code.
   (c). The failing test and error message: The failing test is asserting the output of shell.info() to be 'Fish Shell 3.5.9', but it fails with an AssertionError. The error message also shows the mismatch in the output.
   (d). The GitHub Issue information: The issue describes a problem with the TheFuck plugin triggering a recursive loop because of the Fish.info() method.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Properly define the Fish class with necessary imports and inheritance.
   - Update the info() method to properly execute the command and return the version.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

# The corrected declaration of the class containing the fixed function
class Fish(Generic):

    # The fixed info() method
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(",")[1].strip())

# The fixed failing test function
def test_info(self, shell, Popen):
    Popen.return_value.stdout.read.side_effect = [b'fish, version 3.5.9\n']
    assert shell.info() == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'
    assert Popen.call_args[0][0] == ['fish', '--version']
```

The corrected code properly defines the Fish class and its info() method. The info() method now executes the correct command to get the version and returns it as expected. The failing test is also updated to reflect the correct command being called in the info() method.

This corrected version of the code should pass the failing test and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub.
