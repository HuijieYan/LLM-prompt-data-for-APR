The issue in the buggy function is that it is using the `stdout.read()` method before waiting for the process to finish. This can lead to an empty or incomplete output. Additionally, the expected output is different from the actual output, so the command being run by Popen is not returning the expected format.

To fix the bug, we need to ensure that we wait for the process to finish before reading the output, and also update the command to retrieve the version information in the correct format.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import subprocess

# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):
    # this is the corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL)
        proc.wait()
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now return the expected output and types for the given input parameters.
