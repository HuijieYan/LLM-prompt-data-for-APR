1. The buggy function "info" is meant to return the name and version of the current shell. The function uses the Popen class to run the command "fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'" and retrieve the version. However, it seems that the function is not properly handling the standard output from the Popen command, which may lead to hanging or incorrect behavior.

The related GitHub issue indicates that the plugin "TheFuck" in Oh-My-Fish is using the function "thefuck -v" to decide when to regenerate functions, but this triggers a recursive loop due to a bug in the "Fish.info()" function.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the way it handles the stdout from the Popen command. The use of "proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8')" may lead to hanging, as it's not properly handling the stdout buffer.

3. The bug's cause:
    (a). The buggy function "info" does not properly handle the stdout from the Popen command, which may lead to hanging.
    (b). The related functions, particularly the usage of the plugin "TheFuck" in Oh-My-Fish, triggers a recursive loop due to the bug in "Fish.info()".
    (c). The GitHub issue information confirms that the use of "thefuck -v" triggers a recursive loop due to the buggy "Fish.info()" function.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
    - Revise the way stdout is handled from the Popen command.
    - Ensure proper error handling and buffer clearance to prevent hanging.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function "info":

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except Exception as e:
        return "Error retrieving version: {}".format(str(e))
```
In this corrected code, we use the `proc.communicate()` method to properly handle the stdout from the Popen command. Additionally, there is error handling to catch any exceptions that may occur during the version retrieval process.
