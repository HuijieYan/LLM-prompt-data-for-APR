The issue with the `info` function is that it is using the wrong command to get the Fish shell version. The command `echo $FISH_VERSION` is used, but instead, it should be `fish --version`. Additionally, as per the failing test, the expected version string is `'fish, version 3.5.9'`, so the format of the return value in the function needs to be corrected as well.

To fix the bug:
1. Replace the command in the `Popen` call from `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']` to `['fish', '--version']`.
2. Update the format of the return value to match the expected value.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

After making these changes, the function should return the correct version string and pass the failing test.
