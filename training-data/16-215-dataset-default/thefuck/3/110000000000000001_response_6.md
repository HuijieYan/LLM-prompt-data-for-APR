1. The buggy function is attempting to retrieve the name and version of the current shell using the `Popen` function from the `subprocess` module in Python. It then attempts to decode the output and format it into a string to be returned.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the usage of `Popen` and the handling of the output.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function is not properly handling the output of the `Popen` command and is not using the correct syntax for subprocess commands.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include using the `subprocess.run` function instead of `Popen` for simpler command execution, and properly handling the output of the command.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        version = subprocess.run(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL, check=True, text=True).stdout.strip()
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError:
        return 'Failed to retrieve shell information'
```

In the corrected code, we use the `subprocess.run` function with proper arguments for the command execution and output handling. We also handle potential errors by using a try-except block.
