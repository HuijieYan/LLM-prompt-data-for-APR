The issue seems to be with the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. The Popen command is using 'echo $FISH_VERSION' to get the version, but the test is expecting 'fish --version' to be used.

To fix the bug, we need to update the command used to get the version of the Fish shell in the info function to match the expected value in the test.

Here's the corrected code for the info function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this update, the Shell.info function will return the correct version of Fish shell, and it will pass the failing test. This change also aligns with the expected input/output variable information provided.

The updated code will also resolve the issue posted in GitHub, as the fix will prevent the recursive loop triggered by the faulty info function.

By making this change, the test should now pass and the functionality of the shell info function will be corrected.
