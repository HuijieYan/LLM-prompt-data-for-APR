The potential error in the problematic function is the command used to retrieve the version of the shell. The function is currently using 'echo $FISH_VERSION' to get the version, but the test is expecting the version to be retrieved using ['fish', '--version'].

The cause of the bug is that the command used to fetch the version in the 'info' function is not consistent with what the test is expecting.

One possible approach for fixing the bug is to modify the command used to retrieve the version in the 'info' function to match what the test is expecting.

Here's the corrected code for the 'info' function:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

With this change, the 'info' function will now retrieve the version using the correct command and will return the expected version.
