Potential error location: The Popen command is using the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' instead of '--version', which is causing the version information to be incorrect.

Bug cause:
(a) The buggy function 'info' is using the wrong command to fetch the version information from the Fish shell.
(b) The failing test is expecting the version '3.5.9' but the info function is returning a different version.
(c) The error message shows that the version returned by the info function is not matching the expected version, indicating a mismatch in the retrieved version.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the Popen command to use 'fish --version' instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION' to fetch the correct version information.
2. Update the info function to ensure it's returning the correct version as expected by the test.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, STDOUT

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=STDOUT)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(',')[1].strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With the corrected code, the function now uses the correct command to fetch the version information and processes it to extract the version number. This should make the function return the correct version of the Fish shell and pass the failing test.
