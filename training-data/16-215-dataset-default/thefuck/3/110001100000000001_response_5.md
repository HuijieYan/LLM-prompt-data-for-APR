1. The `info` function is trying to get the name and version of the current shell by running a command through the `Popen` function and capturing the output. The potential issue may be with how the output is being captured and decoded.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip() line where the output from the command is being read and decoded.

3. The bug is caused by the incorrect usage of the `Popen` function and how the output is being captured. The `Popen` function is not being used correctly to capture the output of the command, and the decoding of the output may not be handled properly.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Use the `subprocess.check_output` function to run the command and capture the output in a more straightforward way.
   - Handle the decoding of the output in a separate step to ensure it is done correctly.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    output = subprocess.check_output(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']).decode('utf-8').strip()
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(output)
```
