1. The provided code is a part of a class called Fish, and it contains a function called info that is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell.

2. The potential error in the problematic function lies in the use of the Popen function from the subprocess module. The output may not be read correctly, leading to a wrong version being returned.

3. The potential cause of the bug is that the code doesn't handle the subprocess correctly, and there may be an issue with reading the version from the subprocess output.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Using the communicate method of the Popen object to get the output.
   - Handling exceptions to avoid any errors while running the subprocess.

5. Corrected code:
```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                         stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
            output, _ = proc.communicate()
            version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
            return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
        except Exception as e:
            print("An error occurred:", e)
```
In the corrected code, we have used the communicate method to get the output of the subprocess and handled any exceptions that may occur during the process.
