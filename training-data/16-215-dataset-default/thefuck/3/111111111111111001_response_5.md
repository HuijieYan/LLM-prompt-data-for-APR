Upon analyzing the provided information, it appears that the error is caused by the incorrect command being used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell. The failing test is asserting for 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' but the actual output is 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'.

To fix the bug, the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell should be corrected from 'echo $FISH_VERSION' to '--version', as shown in the failing test.

The corrected code for the problematic function, 'info', is as follows:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().replace('fish, version ', '')
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
