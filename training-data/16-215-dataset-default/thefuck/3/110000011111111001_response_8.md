The bug in the provided function is that it is not using the correct command to get the fish version. The command should be 'fish --version' instead of 'echo $FISH_VERSION'. Also, the assertion in the failing test is comparing the complete command string, so it should be modified to check only the version part.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

The failing test should be modified as follows:

```python
def test_info(self, shell, Popen):
    Popen.return_value.stdout.read.side_effect = [b'fish, version 3.5.9\n']
    assert shell.info() == 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'
    assert Popen.call_args[0][0] == ['fish', '--version']
```

With these changes, the corrected function will pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided.
