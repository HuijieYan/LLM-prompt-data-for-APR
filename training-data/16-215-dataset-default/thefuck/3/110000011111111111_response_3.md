The issue with the buggy function is that it uses the incorrect command to retrieve the Fish shell version. The `Popen` call is using `echo $FISH_VERSION` to get the version, but the correct command should be `fish --version`.

The failing test is expecting the output to be `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the actual output is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`.

The GitHub issue indicates that this bug causes a recursive loop when using Oh-My-Fish's TheFuck plugin.

To fix the bug, the `info` function should be modified to use the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version. Additionally, the function should return the correct format as mentioned in the failing test.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split()[-1]  # Extract only the version number
    return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

This corrected code should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and successfully resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
