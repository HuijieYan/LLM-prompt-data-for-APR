The potential error location within the problematic function is with the command used to get the Fish shell version. The command '[fish, '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']' is incorrect, and it should be '[fish', '--version']' to get the correct version of the Fish shell.

The bug's cause is that the command used to get the version of the Fish shell is incorrect in the info function of the Fish class, which leads to the incorrect version being returned.

To fix the bug, the command used to get the version of the Fish shell should be changed to '[fish', '--version']' in the info function of the Fish class.

Here is the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
# The declaration of the class containing the buggy function
class Fish(Generic):

    # the corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(', version ')[1])
```
