The potential error location within the problematic function is in the line `Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)`. This line seems to be running the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` to get the version of the fish shell.

The bug's cause is that the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` is not returning the version in the correct format. Instead of just the version number, it is returning something like `fish, version 3.5.9\n` which is causing the assertion error in the test function.

To fix the bug, we need to modify the function to parse the version number from the output of the command.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(" ")[-1]  # Extracting the version number
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected code, the function should now return the correct version number and pass the failing test.
