1. The buggy function is a part of the Fish Shell and it is being triggered by the TheFuck plugin in Oh-My-Fish. The function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell, but it is causing a recursive loop when used with the -v flag.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of Popen to execute the 'fish -c' command.

3. The cause of the bug is that the function info() is being called recursively when the TheFuck plugin uses the -v flag to determine when to regenerate functions. This causes a loop and hangs the shell. The Popen command is not handling the execution properly, leading to the recursive loop.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include:
   - Checking for the presence of the -v flag in the function and handling it properly to avoid the recursive loop.
   - Using a different method for getting the version of the shell that does not cause a recursive loop.

5. Corrected code:

```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    if '-v' in sys.argv or '--version' in sys.argv:
        return "TheFuck plugin is causing the shell to hang with the -v flag."
    else:
        version = subprocess.check_output(['fish', '--version']).decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In the corrected code, we are checking for the presence of the -v flag and returning a message if it is found, to avoid the recursive loop. We are also using a different method (subprocess) to get the version of the shell, which should not cause any issues.
