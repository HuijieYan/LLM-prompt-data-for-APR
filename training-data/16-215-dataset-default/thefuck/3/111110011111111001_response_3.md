The issue with the given buggy function is that it is trying to retrieve the Fish shell version using the command "echo $FISH_VERSION", but the test is expecting the command "fish --version" to be executed.

To fix the bug, we need to update the function to execute the "fish --version" command instead of "echo $FISH_VERSION".

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split(' ')[2])
```

With this correction, the function will execute the correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version, and it will pass the failing test.
