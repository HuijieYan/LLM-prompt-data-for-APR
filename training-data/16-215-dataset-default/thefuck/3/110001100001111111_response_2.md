The problem with the current code is that the Fish.info() function is not returning the expected version of the Fish shell. The Popen call is not capturing the correct output, causing the function to return an incorrect version.

The issue on GitHub suggests that there is a recursive loop triggering the Oh-My-Fish plugin when using the `thefuck -v` command. This is likely due to the incorrect version being returned by the Fish.info() function.

To fix the bug, we need to make sure that the Popen call captures the correct output and that the version string is constructed properly.

Here's the corrected code for the Fish.info() function:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell, version {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the expected input/output variable values should be satisfied, and the issue on GitHub should also be resolved. This fix ensures that the correct version of the Fish shell is returned by the Fish.info() function.
