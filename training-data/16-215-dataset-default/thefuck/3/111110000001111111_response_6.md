The buggy function is a method called `info` inside the `Fish` class, where it tries to get the version of the fish shell using the Popen function from the subprocess module, and then returns a formatted string with the version number.

The input parameter values and types are not provided, and it seems that the problem lies within the Popen function call. The expected and actual values of the variables `proc`, `version`, `proc.stdout.read`, and `proc.stdout` are also not consistent, which indicates that there is an issue with the subprocess call.

The GitHub issue suggests that the problem occurs when using the Oh-My-Fish plugin TheFuck, and that the fix is on its way.

It seems that the problem is with the Popen call to get the fish version, as it might be hanging when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin. The discrepancy in the actual and expected output values also suggests that the Popen call is not returning the expected output.

To fix the bug, we can try using a different method to get the fish version, or handle the Popen call in a way that it does not hang when used with the Oh-My-Fish plugin. Additionally, we can also update the class to resolve the issue posted in GitHub.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        try:
            version = subprocess.check_output(['fish', '-v']).decode('utf-8').strip()
        except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
            version = "Unknown"
        
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

In this corrected code, we use `subprocess.check_output` to get the version of the fish shell, and handle any potential errors using a try-except block. This should resolve the hanging issue when using the Oh-My-Fish plugin and provide the correct fish shell version.
