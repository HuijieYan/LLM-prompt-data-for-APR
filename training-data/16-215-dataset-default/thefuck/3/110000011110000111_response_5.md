1. The buggy function is 'info' within the shells/fish.py file. The failing test code is trying to test the 'info' function by mocking the Popen object. The error message shows that the output from the function is not as expected, and this has led to an assertion error. The GitHub issue states that the TheFuck plugin triggers a recursive loop because of the 'info' function.

2. The potential error location within the 'info' function is the command sent to the Popen function. It is trying to retrieve the version by running 'echo $FISH_VERSION' instead of 'fish --version', which leads to an incorrect version being returned.

3. The potential cause of the bug is that the 'info' function is not retrieving the correct version of the Fish Shell due to the incorrect shell command being used. This results in the test failing, as it expects a specific version number.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   a. Modify the shell command within the 'info' function to 'fish --version' to correctly retrieve the version of the Fish Shell.
   b. Update the failing test to account for the correct output after the function has been fixed.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.replace('fish, version ', ''))
```

The corrected function uses the correct shell command 'fish --version' to retrieve the version of the Fish Shell. It then strips the unnecessary 'fish, version ' prefix from the version output. This corrected function should pass the failing test and resolve the GitHub issue.
