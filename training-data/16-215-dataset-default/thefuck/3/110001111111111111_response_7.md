The issue seems to be that the Popen call in the info function of the Fish shell is using the wrong command to get the version of Fish. The Popen call should use 'fish --version' instead of 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION' to get the version of Fish.

The failing test is checking for the output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' but the actual output is 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'.

To fix the bug, we need to update the Popen call in the info function to use 'fish --version' command to get the version of Fish.

The corrected code for the info function would be:

```python
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.replace('fish, version ', ''))
```

This should fix the bug and make the failing test pass. It will also resolve the issue posted on GitHub where TheFuck plugin was causing a recursive loop due to the incorrect behavior of the info function.
