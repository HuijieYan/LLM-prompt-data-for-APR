Potential error location: The potential error location seems to be in the `info` function of the `Fish` class.

Bug's cause:
(a). The buggy function `info` in the `Fish` class is using the command `echo $FISH_VERSION` to retrieve the Fish shell version.
(b). The failing test is checking for the output 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' but it's receiving 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'.
(c). The failing test also indicates that the `Popen` call is using ['fish', '--version'] instead of ['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'] as mentioned in the `info` function.
(d). The GitHub issue reports that the use of the `thefuck -v` command triggers a recursive loop because of the `info` function.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the `info` function to use the `--version` flag instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION`.
2. Update the failing test to expect the output based on the new command.
3. Ensure that the fix resolves the recursive loop issue mentioned in the GitHub issue.

Correction to the problematic function:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# The declaration of the class containing the corrected function
class Fish(Generic):
    # The corrected function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(',')[1].strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected code, the `info` function now uses the `--version` command instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION` and extracts the version from the output. This should pass the failing test and resolve the issue mentioned in the GitHub report.
