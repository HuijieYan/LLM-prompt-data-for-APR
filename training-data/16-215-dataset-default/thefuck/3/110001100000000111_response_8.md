The buggy function is 'info' within the fish.py file of the thefuck/shells directory. The function attempts to get the version of the current shell by executing a subprocess with Popen and reading the stdout. The issue seems to be related to the use of the -v flag causing a recursive loop, as mentioned in the GitHub issue title and description.

The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of Popen and the subprocess to get the version of the shell. This is causing a recursive loop with the -v flag, leading to the hanging of the Fish Shell initialisation.

The bug's cause is that when the -v flag is used with thefuck, it triggers a recursive loop because the info function in fish.py is not handling this correctly.

To fix the bug, we can modify the info function to handle the -v flag properly and prevent the recursive loop. We can also ensure that the subprocess is executed in a way that does not cause hanging.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self, argument=None):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    if argument == '-v':
        return "Fish Shell version check"
    else:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected code includes a check for the -v flag in the info function. If the -v flag is passed, it returns a message indicating that it is for version check. Otherwise, it proceeds with the original functionality of fetching the version of the Fish Shell. This should resolve the hanging issue related to the -v flag.
