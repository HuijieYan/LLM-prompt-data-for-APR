Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the command used to get the Fish shell version. The `Popen` command is being used to execute the command `echo $FISH_VERSION`, but the expected output is `fish --version`.

Bug cause:
- The `info` function is trying to get the Fish shell version using an incorrect command.
- The failing test is expecting the output generated by `fish --version`, but the function is generating a different version format.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
- Update the `Popen` command to execute `fish --version` instead of `echo $FISH_VERSION` to get the correct Fish shell version.
- Modify the function to format the version string to match the expected output of the failing test.

Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version[11:])
```

By updating the Popen command to use `fish --version` and modifying the version formatting to match the expected output of the failing test, the corrected function should satisfy both the failing test and the expectations of the GitHub issue.
