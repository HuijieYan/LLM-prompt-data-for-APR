Potential error location: The potential error lies in the way the Popen object is being used to retrieve the version of the fish shell. The code is trying to read the output of the subprocess using `proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()` without waiting for the subprocess to finish. This can lead to incomplete or missing output.

Bug's cause:
(a). The buggy function `info` is trying to fetch the version of the fish shell by running a subprocess using Popen, but it does not wait for the subprocess to finish before trying to read the output.
(b). The buggy class `Fish` seems to be a class for handling the fish shell specific functionalities.
(c). The related function uses Popen to run a command in the shell and retrieve its output.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
- Use `communicate()` method of the Popen object after starting the subprocess to wait for it to finish and then retrieve its output.
- Add error handling in case the subprocess encounters an error.

Corrected code:
```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        stdout, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = stdout.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```
In the corrected code, the `communicate()` method is used to wait for the subprocess to finish and retrieve its output. Additionally, error handling can be added if needed.
