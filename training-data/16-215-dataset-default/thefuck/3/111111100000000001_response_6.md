1. The buggy function is a part of the Fish class, which is a subclass of the Generic class. The function is intended to return the name and version of the current shell.

2. The potential error is in the line where the Popen function is used to execute the command "fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'" and capture its output.

3. The cause of the bug is likely due to the way the Popen function is used to execute the command and capture its output. There may also be issues with how the version information is extracted from the output.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Ensure that the Popen function is used correctly to capture the output of the command.
   - Use the communicate() method to interact with the process and capture its output.
   - Check for errors in the command execution and handle them appropriately.

5. Corrected code:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL, shell=True)
        version, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = version.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'
```

In the corrected code:
- We import the Popen, PIPE, and DEVNULL modules from the subprocess module.
- We use the communicate() method to capture the output of the command.
- We decode the output and strip any leading or trailing whitespace.
- We use an f-string to format the version information in the return statement.
