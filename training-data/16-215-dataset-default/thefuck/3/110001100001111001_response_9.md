The bug in the `info` function is that it is not importing the necessary modules and classes. It is using `Popen` and `PIPE` classes without importing them from the `subprocess` module.

To fix the bug, we need to import the necessary modules and classes at the beginning of the file. Additionally, we need to update the command passed to `Popen` and the string format in the return statement to match the expected output.

Here is the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $version'],
                            stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL, shell=True)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell, version {}'.format(version)
```

With this corrected code, the `info` function should now return the expected value and type for the given input parameters.
