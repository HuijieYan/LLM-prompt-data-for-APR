Potential Error Location:
The error likely lies in the way the function is trying to retrieve the Fish shell version using Popen and stdout.read().

Bug Cause:
The buggy function is trying to execute the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' using Popen and retrieve the output, but it is not handling the process correctly. This is causing a hang when the -v option is used, triggering a recursive loop.

Possible Approaches for Fixing the Bug:
1. Use subprocess.check_output() instead of Popen and stdout.read() to execute the command and retrieve the output.
2. Add proper error handling to the function to avoid hanging in case of errors.
3. Ensure that the function does not trigger a recursive loop when the -v option is used.

Corrected Code:
```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        version = subprocess.check_output(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL).decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except subprocess.CalledProcessError as e:
        # Handle the error, for example:
        print(f"Error retrieving Fish shell version: {e}")
        return "Fish Shell version not available"
```

This corrected code should successfully resolve the issue reported on GitHub and prevent the hang when using the -v option with TheFuck plugin.
