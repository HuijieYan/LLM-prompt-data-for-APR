Potential error location:
The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of the Popen function without importing it from the subprocess module.

Bug's cause:
The cause of the bug is that the function is not importing the Popen function from the subprocess module, so it is unable to execute the command properly and retrieve the version information.

Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Import the Popen function from the subprocess module at the beginning of the file.
2. Use the communicate method of the proc object to retrieve the output instead of directly reading from stdout.

Corrected code:

```python
# The relative path of the corrected file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
