The issue with the current implementation seems to be that the command executed to retrieve the version of the Fish shell does not include the desired output format. The expected output value includes "fish, version", which is missing from the current implementation.

To fix this bug, we need to modify the command that is being executed to include "fish, version" in the output.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo fish, version $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now return the expected value and type of variables for the failing test case.
