1. The buggy function is trying to retrieve the version of the current shell by running a command in the shell and capturing the output. The function uses the Popen class from the subprocess module to execute the 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION' command and capture the output.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is likely the usage of the Popen class and the handling of the output.

3. The bug is likely caused by the incorrect handling of the subprocess output. The Popen class should be used with the communicate() method to capture the output properly. Additionally, there might be an issue with the way the command is formed, especially in the usage of 'echo $FISH_VERSION'.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug are:
   a. Use the communicate() method of the Popen class to capture the output of the subprocess.
   b. Check the command being executed and ensure it correctly retrieves the version of the shell.

5. Here's the corrected code:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version, _ = proc.communicate()
    version = version.decode('utf-8').strip()
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
