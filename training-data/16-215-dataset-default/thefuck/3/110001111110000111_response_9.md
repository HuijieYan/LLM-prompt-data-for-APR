1. The buggy function is a method called "info" within the "Fish" class in the fish.py file. This function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell. The failing test function is testing the output of this "info" function. The error message indicates that the expected output is "Fish Shell 3.5.9" but the actual output is "Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9", showing that the version format is incorrect.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the way the version string is being extracted and formatted.

3. Bug's cause:
   (a). The buggy function does not correctly extract and format the version information from the shell command.
   (b). The failing test function is expecting a specific format for the shell version, which is not being met.
   (c). The error message clearly indicates the mismatch between expected and actual output.
   (d). The GitHub issue suggests that the problem is related to using the "thefuck -v" command triggering a recursive loop in the shell's initialization process.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   (a). Modify the way the version information is extracted from the shell command to ensure it matches the expected format.
   (b). Adjust the "info" function to format the version information correctly.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

class Fish:
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        version = version.split()[-1]  # Extract only the version number
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By modifying the method to use 'fish --version' command and extracting only the version number, the corrected code will provide the expected output. This change should resolve the failing test and fix the issue described in the GitHub post.
