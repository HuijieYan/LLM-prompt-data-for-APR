1. The buggy function is a part of the `Fish` class in the `fish.py` file of the `thefuck` project. The `info` function is designed to return the name and version of the current shell. The GitHub issue indicates that when the `thefuck -v` command is used, it triggers a recursive loop, which seems to be caused by this `info` function.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the subprocess call using `Popen` to execute the `fish` command and retrieve the `FISH_VERSION` environment variable.

3. The bug is caused by the `info` function not properly retrieving the version of the Fish shell, leading to a recursive loop when the `thefuck -v` command is used. The `info` function is called when the `thefuck -v` is executed, creating a loop due to how it retrieves the Fish shell version. The GitHub issue further highlights that Oh-My-Fish's TheFuck plugin triggers this recursive loop.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the `info` function to properly and safely retrieve the version of the Fish shell without causing a recursive loop.
   - Modify the logic in the `info` function to avoid triggering the recursive loop when used with the `thefuck -v` command.
   - Evaluate and address any underlying issues with the Oh-My-Fish plugin that are contributing to the recursive loop.

5. Corrected code for the `info` function to resolve the bug:

```python
# The corrected version of the buggy function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    try:
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.communicate()[0].decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
    except Exception as e:
        return "Fish shell version could not be retrieved"
```
