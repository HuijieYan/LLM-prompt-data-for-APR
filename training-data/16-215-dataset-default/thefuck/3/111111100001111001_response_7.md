The issue with the buggy function is that it is not handling the Popen object and its read method correctly. The Popen object needs to be waited for to finish before reading its output.

To fix the bug, we can use the `communicate` method of the Popen object, which will wait for the process to finish and return the output. We also need to adjust the expected value of `version` to match the format of the actual output of the command.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        output, _ = proc.communicate()
        version = output.decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'fish, version {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now return the expected value and type of variables as provided.
