The issue with the buggy function is that it is trying to retrieve the version of the fish shell with the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION', but the test is expecting the version to be retrieved with the command 'fish --version'.

To fix the bug, we need to update the command in the Popen call to 'fish --version' to match the expected output in the test.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic


class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this change, the function should now return the expected version string and the failing test should pass.
