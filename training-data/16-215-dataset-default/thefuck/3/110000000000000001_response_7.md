1. The buggy function is supposed to return the name and version of the current shell using the Fish shell. It uses the Popen function to run the 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION' command and capture the output to obtain the version.

2. The potential error location within the function is the usage of the Popen function and the way the output is read and decoded.

3. The cause of the bug is that the Popen function is not being used correctly to capture the output of the command. Additionally, the decoding of the output may also not be handled properly.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug include using the subprocess module's check_output function to run the command and capture its output. Additionally, decoding the output using the proper encoding can also resolve the issue.

5. Here is the corrected code:

```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    version = subprocess.check_output(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']).decode('utf-8').strip()
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```
