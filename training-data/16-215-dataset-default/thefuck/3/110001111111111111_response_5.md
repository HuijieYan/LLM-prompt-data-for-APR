The issue seems to be with the incorrect command being passed to Popen in the info function. The Popen command should be `['fish', '--version']` instead of `['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION']`. This is causing the version to be retrieved in a different format than expected, leading to the failing test.

To fix the bug, the command passed to Popen in the info function needs to be updated to `['fish', '--version']` so that it retrieves the version in the expected format.

Here's the corrected code for the info function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.replace('fish, version ', ''))
```

With this corrected code, the info function should now pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and resolve the issue posted in GitHub.
