The issue with the `info` function is that it is not using the correct command to get the Fish shell version. The `Popen` command is trying to execute `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` to get the version, but the correct command should be `fish --version`. Additionally, the format of the output string is incorrect. The expected output is 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' but the current function is returning 'Fish Shell 3.5.9'.

To fix the bug, the `info` function should be updated to use the correct command to get the version and to format the output string correctly.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split()[-1]
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This code should now pass the failing test and satisfy the expected input/output variable information.
