1. The buggy function is part of a class called Fish, and it is used to get the name and version of the current shell. The GitHub issue indicates that the usage of the function thefuck -v in Oh-My-Fish plugin causes a recursive loop because of the Fish.info() function.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the use of Popen to execute the command 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION'. This can lead to a recursive loop when the function is called in certain contexts.

3. The cause of the bug is that calling the function to get the shell version triggers a recursive loop due to the way the Popen command is executed. This results in an infinite loop and causes the shell to hang.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug could include finding an alternative way to get the shell version without causing a recursive loop, or modifying the function so that it does not trigger the recursive loop when called in certain contexts.

5. Corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
import os
from subprocess import run, PIPE, DEVNULL

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        if 'FISH_VERSION' in os.environ:
            version = os.environ['FISH_VERSION']
        else:
            proc = run(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL, text=True)
            version = proc.stdout.strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This corrected code checks if the FISH_VERSION environment variable is already set and uses it if available. If not, it runs the command 'fish -c echo $FISH_VERSION' to get the version. This approach avoids triggering a recursive loop and resolves the issue mentioned in the GitHub post.
