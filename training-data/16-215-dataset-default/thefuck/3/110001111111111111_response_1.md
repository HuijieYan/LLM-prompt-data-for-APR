The issue with the function `info` in `fish.py` is that it is not properly retrieving the version of the Fish shell. The command `echo $FISH_VERSION` does not return the version with "Fish Shell" prefixed. This causes the failing test as the expected and actual values do not match.

To fix this, we need to change the command to `fish --version` to properly retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

Here's the corrected code for the `info` function in `fish.py`:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now properly retrieve the version of the Fish shell and pass the failing test. Additionally, it will also resolve the issue posted on GitHub regarding the recursive loop triggered by the incorrect version retrieval.
