The potential error in the buggy function is the command used to get the version of the Fish shell. The function is using 'echo $FISH_VERSION' to get the version, but instead it should be using 'fish --version'.

The bug is causing the failing test to assert the incorrect shell version, leading to an AssertionError.

To fix this bug, the function 'info' in the 'Fish' class needs to be updated to use the correct command to get the Fish shell version.

Here's the corrected code for the 'info' function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version.split()[-1])
```

With this correction, the function should now return the correct version of the Fish shell and pass the failing test. Furthermore, it resolves the issue reported on GitHub where the use of 'echo $FISH_VERSION' was causing a recursive loop.
