The buggy function is attempting to retrieve the version of the Fish shell using the Popen class from the subprocess module, but it seems to be using MagicMock objects instead of the actual Popen class.

The potential error location within the function is the way the Popen class is being used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell.

The cause of the bug is that the MagicMock objects are being used instead of the actual Popen class, which is why the function is not returning the expected value.

To fix the bug, we need to use the actual Popen class to execute the command for retrieving the Fish shell version.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL, encoding='utf-8')
        version = proc.communicate()[0].strip()
        return f'Fish shell, version {version}'
```

With this corrected code, the function should now return the expected value and type of variables as provided in the test cases.
