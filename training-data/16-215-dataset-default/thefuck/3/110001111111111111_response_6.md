The issue in the buggy function is that it is using the command "echo $FISH_VERSION" to get the Fish shell version but the expected version format is "fish, version x.x.x" which is not being retrieved correctly.

The failing test is asserting the output of shell.info() to be 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' but the actual output is 'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'. This is due to the version retrieval command returning a different format.

The GitHub issue indicates that the version retrieval command might be causing issues with the Oh-My-Fish plugin.

To fix the bug, the version retrieval command needs to be updated to return the expected format of 'fish, version x.x.x'.

The corrected code for the problematic function is as follows:

```python
# The relative path of the buggy file: thefuck/shells/fish.py

# corrected function
def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                 stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(' ')[2]
    return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

By changing the command to 'fish --version' and then parsing the output to retrieve only the version number, the corrected function should now return the expected 'Fish Shell 3.5.9' and satisfy the failing test, as well as the expected input/output variable information. Additionally, this fix should resolve the issue reported on GitHub.
