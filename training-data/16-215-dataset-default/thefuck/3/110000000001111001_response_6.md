The issue with the buggy function is that it is attempting to execute a command using the Popen class from the subprocess module, but it is not actually running the command. This is why the values for proc.stdout.read(), proc.stdout, and version are all MagicMock objects.

To fix this bug, we need to actually run the command and capture its output using the subprocess module.

Here is the corrected code:

```python
import subprocess

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = subprocess.Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo $FISH_VERSION'],
                            stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL, shell=True)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    return u'Fish Shell, version {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now properly execute the command and capture the output, satisfying the expected input/output variable information provided.
