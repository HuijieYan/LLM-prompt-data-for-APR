Potential error location: The issue seems to be with the command 'echo $FISH_VERSION' in the Popen call. The expected output value includes the word 'fish' which is missing in the current implementation.

Bug Cause: The current implementation of the info function only returns the version number of the Fish shell. However, the expected output includes the word 'fish', indicating that the command used in the Popen call should have 'fish' in its output.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the command in the Popen call to include 'echo fish, version $FISH_VERSION' instead of just 'echo $FISH_VERSION'. This will ensure that the output includes the word 'fish'.
2. Ensure that the decoding and stripping of the version number is handled correctly.

Corrected code:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):
    # Corrected info function
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '-c', 'echo fish, version $FISH_VERSION'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'{}'.format(version)
```

The corrected info function will now include the word 'fish' in the output, as expected. It also handles decoding and stripping the version number correctly. This should resolve the issue posted in the GitHub bug report.
