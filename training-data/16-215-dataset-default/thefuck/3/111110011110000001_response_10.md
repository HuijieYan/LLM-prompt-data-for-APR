1. The buggy function is part of a class called Fish. The function is supposed to return the version of the Fish shell. The failing test is trying to verify that the function returns the expected version of the Fish shell.

2. The potential error location within the problematic function is the command being passed to Popen. It currently uses 'echo $FISH_VERSION', which may not provide the correct version information.

3. The bug's cause is as follows:
   (a) The `info` function uses a shell command to retrieve the version, which might not return the expected output.
   (b) The class `Fish` might not handle the retrieval of the version from the Fish shell correctly.
   (c) The failing test is expecting a specific version string to be returned, but the actual output includes additional information.

4. Possible approaches for fixing the bug:
   - Update the command used in the `info` function to retrieve the version information in the correct format.
   - Ensure that the `Fish` class handles the retrieval and formatting of the version information accurately.
   - Adjust the failing test to account for any additional information in the version string.

5. Corrected code:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic

class Fish(Generic):    
    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)  # Updated command to retrieve version
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip().split(', version ')[1]  # Extracts version from the output
        return f'Fish Shell {version}'  # Using f-string for formatting
```

With the above corrected code, the `info` function should now properly retrieve the correct version of the Fish shell. This should make the failing test pass as well.
