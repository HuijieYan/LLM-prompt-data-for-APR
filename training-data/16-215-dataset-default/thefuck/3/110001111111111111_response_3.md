Potential error location within the problematic function: The issue lies in the `info` function where the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'` is used to get the version of the Fish shell. The returned value is not in the expected format, leading to the assertion error in the test.

Bug's cause:
(a). The `info` function retrieves the version using the command `fish -c 'echo $FISH_VERSION'`, but the returned value does not match the expected format.
(b). The failing test `test_info` expects the version to be `'Fish Shell 3.5.9'`, but the actual returned value is `'Fish Shell fish, version 3.5.9'`.
(c). This discrepancy causes the assertion error in the failing test, leading to the identified issue in the GitHub repository.

Approaches for fixing the bug:
1. Modify the command used to retrieve the version of the Fish shell in the `info` function.
2. Update the `test_info` to assert the actual value returned from the `info` function.
3. Ensure that the returned version matches the expected format.

Corrected code for the problematic function:
```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL

def info(self):
    """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
    proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'], stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
    version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
    version = version.split(",")[0]
    return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

The changes made in the corrected code are:
1. Modified the command to `fish --version` to retrieve the version of the Fish shell.
2. Trimmed the returned version to only include the version number.
3. Removed the unnecessary `u` from the return string.

With these changes, the corrected function should pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information, and resolve the issue reported in the GitHub repository.
