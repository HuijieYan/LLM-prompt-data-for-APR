The problem seems to be with the incorrect command used to retrieve the Fish shell version. The current command is 'echo $FISH_VERSION', which is invalid. The correct command to retrieve the Fish shell version is 'fish --version'.

Here's the corrected code for the buggy function:

```python
from subprocess import Popen, PIPE, DEVNULL
from typing import Generic


class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return 'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

This should fix the issue and the function should now return the expected value and type of variables.
