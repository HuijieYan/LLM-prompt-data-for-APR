The potential error location within the problematic function is the command used in Popen to get the fish version.

The cause of the bug seems to be that the Popen command is using 'echo $FISH_VERSION' to get the version, but the failing test is expecting it to use 'fish --version' instead.

To fix the bug, we need to update the command in the Popen call to 'fish --version' to match the expectation of the failing test.

Here's the corrected code for the problematic function:

```python
class Fish(Generic):

    def info(self):
        """Returns the name and version of the current shell"""
        proc = Popen(['fish', '--version'],
                     stdout=PIPE, stderr=DEVNULL)
        version = proc.stdout.read().decode('utf-8').strip()
        return u'Fish Shell {}'.format(version)
```

With this correction, the function should now pass the failing test, satisfy the expected input/output variable information provided, and successfully address the issue posted on GitHub.
